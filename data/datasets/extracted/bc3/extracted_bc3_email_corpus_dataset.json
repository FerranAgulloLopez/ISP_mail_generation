Now I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged to participate broadly. And I am hopeful that new activities (my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to attend. \nBut firmer scheduling would be a big win. \nregards, Terry \nTerry Allen Electronic Commerce and Publishing Consultant \ntallen[at]sonic.net \nhttp://www.sonic.net/~tallen/ \nDocBook: http://www.ora.com/davenport/index.html \nCommon Business Library: http://www.veosystems.com/",

I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data: \nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Apr/0252.html \nso we'll have to see how that pans out. Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples). \nThere are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples: \nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos \nSo, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like: \nhttp://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/brand%20x/maps%20and%20globes/t_bxp_c31027.jpg.jpg \nwhich has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); \nand http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg \nwhich would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though). \nDo people have a preference for one style over the other? \nCould you let us know today if possible?

The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille. Possible substitutions: baked Scrod (fish) chicken caesar salad hommus roll-up sandwich with salad salad with crab cakes churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions I will do this in the following way: If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear. It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do. The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday.

When I am not at AFB I live the life of a graduate student. At the moment I am in the process of collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements. In general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream technology, including the web. Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of assistive technology. Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor. I'm looking forward to working with the group. Kitch",

These insure a sensible flow chart... at least a chart that \"parses\" correctly.

Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines: we're just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that.

I could *not* re-create the problem described when I tested this on my own system using MS Word 97 for Windows. I followed the scenario with a simple test page (created in Netscape Page Composer) with a Heading, one line of text, and an image with ALT= text. I opened the HTML file in Word97, added one word to the text of the Heading, then saved the file back to HTML with a new name. The ALT= text was not affected. MS Word 97, at least, seems to recognize HTML and preserve it. Obviously, other versions of Word may behave differently. I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML.

If not, then an author who has published a style sheet with !important will override yours. (sigh) \nI don't know which cascade Amaya uses.

Unfortunately once someone's site chooses a color you are stuck with it... I am suggesting that an override be provided as an ACCESSIBILITY issue. Amaya can lead the way on this as it does on several other issues such as MathML. Thanks for suggestion. It took a while to get amaya.css going as at first i thought it had to have tags ala html --- this worked on other browsers but not in amaya --- dropped any html tags and it worked like charm.
