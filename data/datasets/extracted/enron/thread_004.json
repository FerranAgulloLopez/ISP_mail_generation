I am KENNETH KABILA\n,the son of the former head of state/\npresident of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr.\nLaurent Desire Kabila.\n\nI am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on this confidential Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.\n\nBefore I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction. Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.\n\nI have the sum of USD55Million from a secret sale of\nDiamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th 2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to security\nreasons,as my narration below will explain. But before I continue be well informed that your share in this\ntransaction has been calculated at 15% of the total sum of USD$55M, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me.\n\nMy father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My step brother Joseph, who is the current president of my country, is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.\n\nAlready president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and private property, which my father left behind for the whole family. Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your assistance to help us receive these funds overseas for proper investment.\n\nLet me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this\ntransaction because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that shows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is in cash and is secured in a financial institution company as consignment.\n\nThe consignment will be released within seven (7) days of my being in receipt of your reply via my email address above only for security reasons.\n\nI am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nreply immediately via my alternative email address:\n(kenkabila008@37.com\nBest Regards,\nKENNETH KABILA\n\n\n\n\napplication/octet-stream attachment: 1.txt\n\n\n\n\n"

I am Edward Masuku, the first and\nonly surviving son of late Marc Masuku  one of the foremost and rich\nblack farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my\ncountry. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to\nJohannesburg-South Africa, to deposit the sum of US$7.5 million (Seven\nMillion Five Hundred United States Dollars) in one of the private security\ncompanies, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in\nZimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and\nchemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in\nSwaziland.\n\nThis land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land\nreform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few\nblack farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of\nrich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties\nby Mugabe?s war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of\nthe country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my\nfamily, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.\n\nI have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits\nasylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial\ntransaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your\ntrustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with\ninvestment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we\nhave virtually lost all our assets.\n\nThere are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 30% of the total\namount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment\nof the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities\ninvolved when you reply providing me with your telephone & fax numbers. \n\nI await your reply through the above contact e-mail, while I implore you to\nmaintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free\ntransaction.\n\nI shall furnish you with more details on request.\n\nYours truly,\nEdward Masuku\n\n\n\n"

Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.\n\nI have the sum of USD55Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th 2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to security reasons,as my narration below will explain. But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transaction has been calculated at 15% of the total sum of USD$55M, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me.\n\nMy father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My step brother Joseph, who is the current president of my country, is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.\n\nAlready president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and private property, which my father left behind for the whole family. Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your assistance to help us receive these funds overseas for proper investment.\n\nLet me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that shows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is in cash and is secured in a financial institution company as consignment.\n\nThe consignment will be released within seven (7) days of my being in receipt of your reply via my email address above only for security reasons.\n\nI am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.\nmy aternative email address is (kenkabila008@37.com)\nmy private phone number is :+229-988-039\nBest Regards,\nKENNETH KABILA \n\n\n\n"

Please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions. \n\nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!\n\nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA) and reported elsewhere in the world. His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles. \"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old woman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year\". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they sus!\npect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. \"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever 15-year-old. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not th!\nink it was going to work\", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills. \"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\". Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.\"The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework\".He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenti!\nes, fifties and hundreds. \"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs).\" Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money!\n received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, \"Please send me report number XYX\".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee. [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions]. \n\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say \"Bull\", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are \"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost\". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when i hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions. In order for all of us to be!\n successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible. This is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\". Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \n\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re- entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.\" More testimonials later but first, = =For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. =You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer. Within a few days you will r!\neceive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step \"1 through 6\" or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. !\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! \n\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: \n\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4. Those 10,000 people!\n send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00 \n\n\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! \n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! \n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. =ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as instructed above.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! =\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Co!\nrporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \"junk mail\". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \"I told you so\" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby\". Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois \n\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back\". \"I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big\". Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks\".

Wo waren Sie, Herr Rau?\nWo blieben die Schlagzeilen der Massenmedien und der Tagesschau?\n\nSIEGBURG - Ein naechtlicher Stadtbummel dreier junger Deutscher in der Nacht vom 15.-16. Juni waere fuer einen der Jugendlichen fast toedlich ausgegangen. Die drei jungen Leute, 17, 18 und 21 Jahre alt, schlenderten ruhig und gut gelaunt nach Mitternacht von McDonalds kommend durch die Siegburger Innenstadt.\n\nSie trugen die bei Jugendlichen beliebten Hemden mit Aufschriften (engldeutsch 'T-Shirt' genannt). Bei einem prangte 'Lieber Currywurst als Doener' auf der Brust, womit er wohl zeigen wollte, dass er als offenbar umerzogener Amideutscher in der multikulturellen Gesellschaft McDonald statt Doener bevorzugte.\n\nDoch diese Vorliebe haette er besser nicht so offen gezeigt. In der Fussgaengerzone kamen den Jugendlichen sieben bis acht auslaendische Mitbuerger der zweiten Generation - nach Polizeibericht mit 'suedlaendischem Aussehen, vermutlich tuerkischer Herkunft' - entgegen, denen diese Parole offenbar nicht gefiel und die sich wohl an den Aufruf des Herrn Bundeskanzlers Schroeder zum 'Aufstand der Anstaendigen' erinnerten.\n\nMit lauten Rufen wie 'Heil Hitler' und 'Nazi-Deutsche' stuerzten sie sich auf die drei, laut Zeugenaussagen 'ohne erkennbaren Grund'.\n\nWaehrend die zwei Juengeren fliehen konnten, schaffte es der 21-jaehrige nicht. Weil ihm ein Bein gestellt wurde, stuerzte er, und die Gruppe schlug und trat auf ihn ein. Einer der Angreifer riss aus einer seitlichen Baumpflanzung einen zwei Meter langen Pflanzpfahl heraus und schlug ihn dem Opfer mehrfach auf den Kopf. Danach flohen die Angreifer, bevor die alarmierte Polizei eintraf.\n\nDer ueberfallene schwebte tagelang in Lebensgefahr, von den Taetern fehlt bislang jede Spur, obwohl die Polizei das Umfeld des Tatortes nach Spuren absuchte und die Bonner Mordkommission den Fall uebernommen hat.\n\n'Ich bin erschrocken ueber das Ausmass an Brutalitaet, mit der da vorgegangen wurde', erklaerte Robert Scholten, Sprecher der Polizei in Bonn. Es sei zwar richtig, dass die drei Angegriffenen zur rechten Szene gehoerten, das koenne jedoch das Vorgehen der Angreifer in keiner Weise rechtfertigen.\n\n\n>Zitat<: WIR sind ueberhaupt nicht erschrocken, denn seit mehr als 20 Jahren wissen und warnen wir vor all solchen Folgen der 'multikulturellen Gesellschaft'. Dass weder der Herr Bundespraesident ans Bett des fast Erschlagenen eilte, noch die Massenmedien ueber diesen brutalen Mordversuch berichteten, entlarvt die Geisteshaltung des Herrn Rau und die Heuchelei der sogenannten 'Anstaendigen' bei den Massenmedien.\n\n\nKommentar des Sober Autors:\nWenn drei leicht angetrunkene Bundeswehr Soldaten mit A. H. Gruss durch die Stadt laufen, ist die Presse mit groesstem Eifer dabei, unsere eigenen Leute nieder zu machen!!!\n\n\n\n"

I was an oil consultan t based in the United kingdom, and because I helped a lot of \nforeign crude Oil companies to get crude oil lifting rights and lucrative Oil contracts \nfrom Angola. I was able to amass fortune worth about USD$148,000,000.00. (One hundred and fourty \neight million United States dollar) On 21st December 2002, I left the U.K. finally with my \nfamily, and came back to Angola. But because of the unfavorable political and economic climate in \nAngola, and for security reasons, I left my money total USD$148,000,000.00 in a security \nsafe Deposit vault in London. On 22nd December 2002, my whole family and I were involved in a \nvery bad accident on our way home to our village at Luanda, Angola. I lost my entire family \nin the accident, and I myself fell into coma since then.\n  \n  \nI eventually recovered from coma, and was discharged from the hospital \ntwo weeks ago. I have no money with which to sponsor anyone in Angola to undertake the trip for \nme. In any case, my extended family here abandoned me in hospital when they realized that \nthe money, which I came back with, had been spent on hospital bills; I am currently living on \nthe charity of the church. And now, I need your help to collect this money in London and \ninvest it in a profitable venture abroad; I cannot bring in this money into Angola for fear of \nseizure by the Government. If the money is properly and profitably invested abroad, I intended to \nleave Angola permanently.\n  \n  \nCan I count on your help? If you agree to help me, I will send you by \ncourier the ELECTRONIC CARD KEY of my vault so that you can travel to London and open the \nvault; you will then remove the money total USD$148,000,000.00 and transfer it to your Bank Account. \nFor your help and assistance, you will keep 25% of the total money for yourself and keep \n75% for me in safe custody until I travel to meet you and invest my shares. If you agree to \nhelp me, please reply me with the following information.\n  \n  \nYour complete name and Street (postal) address.\nYour phone and fax number, including mobile if any\nYour confidential email address.\nOnce I receive your reply stating your street postal address as above, I \nwill send to you the Safe Deposit Vault key be EXPRESS MAIL, and I will also forward to you \nmore details of this transaction by email.\n  \n  \nRegards,\n  \nMR.richard\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi there,\n\n\n\nThanks for submitting your poem. It is currently being considered for the latest edition of our Poetry Contest. Below are some guidelines and helpful hints that you might want to consider when sending in your poems.\n\n\n\nRULES\n\n\n\nThere aren't too many rules for the Poetry Contest, but if you send us a\n\npoem and it doesn't get posted with the other current winners, then here are\n\nsome reasons why it might not have gotten in.\n\n\n\n1. Copying the poem of another NeoPets user and submitting it as your own is\n\nplagiarism, and it's wrong. If you send us another user's poem, and attempt\n\nto claim it as your own, then there is a strong possibility that your\n\naccount will be frozen... so DON'T DO IT!!!\n\n\n\n2. Your poem should come to us in one of two ways; either in the body of an\n\nemail message, or as a .doc or .txt attachment. To be honest with you, we'd\n\nprefer that you sent your poems within the text of the email; by and large,\n\nwe'd rather stay away from opening attachments.\n\n\n\n3. In order for us to post your poem, you need to tell us your username.\n\nOtherwise, we won't be able to give you credit for the poem and send you\n\nyour prize. However, keep in mind that we only need your username, and NOT\n\nYOUR PASSWORD! Anyone who tells you that they need your password is trying\n\nto scam you, so DON'T tell them, whatever you do!\n\n\n\n4. Your poem must include characters, places and events that relate to the\n\nNeoPets site. If you submit a poem that isn't related to NeoPets, your\n\naccount won't be frozen... just don't expect to see it posted anytime soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nHELPFUL HINTS\n\n\n\n1. We prefer to post poems that are 100% original. However, if you really\n\nwant to submit a Neopian version of \"The 12 Days of Christmas\" or Edgar\n\nAllan Poe's \"The Raven,\" then by all means send it in. Keep in mind, though,\n\nthat we receive a dozen or so \"parodies\" every week, so unless your version\n\nis really, REALLY good, then it probably isn't going to be selected.\n\n\n\n2. If you're looking for something to write about, then visiting the New\n\nFeatures page is a great way to find some inspiration. Poems relating to\n\ncurrent events on the site stand a much better chance of winning. If a new\n\nworld has just been launched, or if there's an ongoing plot (such as \"The\n\nSearch for Coltzan's Crown,\" or \"Neopets Version 2\") then it might be a good\n\nidea to make it the topic of your poem.\n\n\n\n3. Ideally, poems should be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 25 to 75 lines\n\nlong. Now, we realise that great poems come in many shapes and sizes, but\n\nit's just awfully hard to pick a three line haiku over a well-written poem\n\nthat's fifty lines long (especially when there's only five winners for each\n\ncontest).\n\n\n\nBy the same token, REALLY long poems (100+ lines), usually don't fare too\n\nwell, either. Why? Because most users don't want to sit there and scroll\n\nthrough an epic poem that takes twenty minutes to read. Every once in a\n\nwhile, if it's unusually good, we'll put up a really long poem; however,\n\nthis tends to be the exception, and not the rule.\n\n\n\n4. As long as a poem is well written, then style or format isn't much of an\n\nissue. It doesn't really matter whether a poem rhymes or doesn't rhyme, and\n\nin the past a number of Haikus, Acrostic Poems, and Sonnets have been chosen\n\nas winners.\n\n\n\nHowever, since they are only three lines long, if you choose the Haiku style\n\nas your format, it's probably a good idea to write 5-8 haikus that all\n\nrelate to a specific topic. For example, a single three-line haiku about\n\nyour Kadoatie probably won't get picked; however, a series of six or seven\n\nhaikus about, say, Krawk Island Petpets, will stand a much better chance.\n\n\n\nAlso, we receive quite a few acrostic poems for the word \"Neopets,\" so if\n\nyou send one in, the chances of it being posted aren't very good. In the\n\npast, we've had some very creative uses of Acrostic poems, such as a Lost\n\nDesert poem in the shape of a pyramid. So, if you're planning to do an\n\nacrostic poem, it's really going to need \"something extra\" to have any shot\n\nat getting posted.\n\n\n\nThanks,\n\nThe NeoPets Team\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: ietf-charsets@w3.org\nTo: poems@neopets.com\nSubject: Mehr fuer Auslaender als fuer Deutsche tun!\n\nLese selbst:\nhttp://www.dsz-verlag.de/Artikel_04/NZ15_1.html\n\n\n\n"

I am Mr.Jonathan Bongani the son of Dr. Simon Bongani,who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through the South Africa Informations Exchange (S.A.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you, my late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president Robert Mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority. \n  Before his death he had taken to Johannesburg -South Africa to deposit the sum of US$ 35.5 Million (Thirty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a Security and Finance Company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was depositedin a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the Security Company. This money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland. \nThis land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the \"modus operandi\" adopted by the government.This resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs. \n precisely, More than thirty-one (31) people have so far been killed.Heads of governments from the west, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plan. Subsequently, South African Development Community(S.A.D.C) has continously supported Mugabe's new land act, it is against this background that I and my family who are currently residing in South Africa have decided to transfer my Father's money into a foreign account. \n  As the eldest son of my Father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family wealth and South Africa's government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in South Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history.More so, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an \"ASYLUM\". \n  As a business person whom I entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter.For your assistance,we are offering you 30% of the total sum,60% for me and my family while 10% will be mapped out for any expenses we may incure during the course of this transaction.We wish to invest ourpart of the money on commercial property based on your advice. \nFinally,all we demand from you is assurance that you will not sit on this money when it finally gets to your personal or company's account in your country. \n If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via the above TELEPHONE number +27-83-424-7661or E-MAIL to the above address. \nBest Regards. \nJonathan Bongani(For the Family).\n\n \n\n\n\n"

I am MR. SITHOLE BALOY from Angola. I am\nthe first and only son of BRIGADIER BALOY JONES. I  am presently resident in South Africa. \nI got your contact address from a business directory  in Johannesburg Chamber of commerce and Industry. On  behalf of my widowed mother MRS. ELIZABETH BALOY, I  desided to solicit for your assistance to transfer  the sum of US$21.5 MILLION( TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE  HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)inherited  from my late father, into your personal company's\naccount.Before my fathers' death, he was a Brigadier in  charge of Arms and Ammunation procurement for the Angola  Army. In his WILL, he specifically drew my attention  to the said sum of money which he deposited in a  safe box of a private Security Company in Johannesburg-  South Africa in a treasure box, fully documented in  my name. \nIN FACT MY FATHER SAID AND I QUOTE  MY BELOVED SON, I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO\nUS$21.5 MILLION . I DEPOSITED THE BOX CONTAINING THIS MONEY IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH  AFRICA. DURING THE WAR, I WAS VERY DEDICATED AND  OFFICERS AND GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONARIES WERE BUSSY  HELPING THEMSELVES WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDS AND\nPROPERTIES AND SENDING THEM TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  DUE TO THIS, WHEN I AND MY FORMER SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE  PRESIDENT WERE ASSIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT (EDUARDO  SANTOS) TO PURCHASE ARMS IN SOUTH AFRICA, WE SAW  THIS AS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERTED THE MONEY AND  DIVIDED IT. i GOT A TOTAL SUM OF US$21.5 MILLION. IN  CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH, AS A RESULT OF DEATH  ONLY, YOU SHOULD SOLICIT FOR THE FUND FOR INVESTMENT\nPURPOSES. \nFrom the above, you will understand that the lives  and future of my family depens on this money, as such I  will be grateful if you can assist us. We are now  living in South Africa as political Asylum seekers\nand financial laws and regulation of the Republic of  South Africa do not permit us financial rights to such\nhuge sum of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this  fund in South africa, hence i am prepared to offer  you 20% of the total fund, while 10% will be set aside  for local and international expenses and 70% will be for  my family and me.  Finally, modalities on howthe transfer will be bone  will be conveyed to you once we have established  trus and confidence between ourselves.

It has defiled all forms of\nmedicine, and right now I have only about a few\nmonths to live, according to medical experts.\n\n\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\nnever really cared for anyone not even myself but my\nbusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never\ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only\nfocus on my business as that was the only thing I\ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know\nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have\nor make all the money in the world. I believe when God\ngives me a second chance to come to this world I would\nlive my life a different way from how I have lived it.\n\n\n\nNow that God ! has called me, I have willed and given\nmost of my properties and assets to my immediate and\nextended family members and as well as a few close\nfriends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my\nsoul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity\norganizations and give succour and confort to the less\npriviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one\nof the last good deeds I do on earth.\n\n\nSo far, I have distributed money to some charity\norganizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do\nthis my self anymore. I once asked members of my\nfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute the\nmoney which I have there to charity organization and\nto the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do\nnot trust them anymore, as they seem not to be\ncontended with what I have left for them.\n\n\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge\ncash deposit of twenty four million dollars that I\nhave with a Security Company in Europe for safe\nkeeping. I will want you to help me collect this\ndeposit and disburse it to some charity organizations\nand to the less priviledged.\n\n\nPlease send me a mail to indicate if you will assist\nme in this disbursement.\n\n\nI have set aside 20% for you for your time and\npatience.\n\n\nYou can e-mail me at: samuelduke@stampmail.com\n\n\nWhile I await to hear from you, may God be with you\nand your entire family.\n\nRemain blessed.\n\nSAMUEL DUKE\n\n \n\n\n\n"

I do not know if\nyou have asked yourself why each time the release of\nthese fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment\nwill be stopped or one problem or the other will come\nup. If you have not asked this question or you do not\nknow, this is an opportunity for me to tell you. Some time ago, your Nigerian \nfriend I mean the people\nthat introduced you to the project approached me\nthrough my dear Wife who works with the federal\nMinistry of Finance and requested me to assist\nthem conclude a money transfer deal they had with you,\nthey requested me to assist them by removing the\noriginal contractors name, companys name and bank\nparticulars from Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) vetting\ncomputer and replacing them with your name and your\nbank details in order to make you appear as the\nrightful beneficiary of this funds. I agreed on\ncondition that they will pay me $100,000 as soon as\nyour name appears as the beneficiary.I did as agreed\nand demanded to be paid but your friends started\ntelling me stories. They even told me that you promise\nto send money to me. Do you know that up till now, I\nhave not received a single cent from them and have not\nset my eyes on any of them. Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the \nfunds\nrelease movement because I cannot be denied of my\nright in my own office considering the risk as it\nmight affect my job. Secondly, I know the source of\nthe funds and you did not execute any contract in\nNigeria, although I am the only person privileged to\nknow this information and it is a fact. Why I am\nmaking this clear to you is that I can see that you\nare still making efforts spending money in order to\nconclude this project. Now I am ready to forget the\npast, I do not need the $100,000 any longer from you\nbut a share of 25% of the total sum. I need your\nassurance that those your colleagues will be totally\nkeep out of this transaction, I know that none of them\nis aware of this transaction after trying their best\nto conclude it without my consent. Finally, I need your promise that no \nofficial of the\nCentral bank of Nigeria will be aware of my\ninvolvement in this regard. Now re-assure me that you\nwill be willing to offer me the 25% of the fund, that\nyou will assist my wife and personal assistant to\nestablish a foreign account in your country where my\nshare will be lodged.

            "content": "Aufnahme der Beitrittsverhandlungen mit der Tuerkei oder nicht - eine Entscheidung, die 'das Ende Europas' bedeuten koennte. Dieses Wort stammt vom frueheren franzoesischen Praesidenten Giscard d'Estaing.\nSchon 2002 hatte er davor gewarnt, dass ein Beitritt der Tuerkei zur EU dem 'Ende Europas' gleichkaeme. Die bundesdeutschen Beitrittsbefuerworter verdraengen und verschweigen die unabsehbaren Folgen dieser Entscheidung:\n\n(1) Die Tuerkei hat schon jetzt 70 Millionen Einwohner. Sie wird bis zu ihrem EU-Beitritt die BRD in der Bevoelkerungszahl ueberholt haben und in den EU-Institutionen das entsprechende Stimmengewicht erhalten.\n(2) Die Tuerkei passt wirtschaftlich nicht in die EU. Das Land ist hoffnungslos ueberschuldet und waere ohne staendige internationalen Kredite laengst bankrott. Das Pro-Kopf-Einkommen betraegt nur 23% des EU-Durchschnitts. Die EU-Subventionen, auf die die Tuerkei Anspruch haette, wuerden nicht nur den Bruesseler Haushalt sprengen, sondern auch die heute schon ueberschuldeten 'Geberlaender' wie die BRD gaenzlich ruinieren.\n(3) Mit der Aufnahme eines asiatischen Landes und dem Verzicht auf vernuenftige Aussengrenzen verliert die EU ihre Identitaet.\n\nTrotz dieser unbestreitbaren Sprengsaetze rollt die Kampagne fuer den tuerkischen Beitritt immer schneller und unaufhaltsamer voran: Der tuerkische Regierungschef Erdogan nimmt bereits an den Konferenzen der EU-Regierungschefs teil, freilich noch ohne Stimmrecht und die Tuerkei erhaelt jetzt schon EU-Gelder zur 'Beitrittsvorbereitung'.\nEs ist alles wie bei der Euro-Einfuehrung: Erst erscheint der ganze Plan unrealistisch und wird von vielen fuer undurchfuehrbar gehalten; dann wird eine offene Diskussion ueber Pro und Contra als 'europa- oder fremdenfeindlich' kriminalisiert, und schliesslich wird die Entscheidung hinter verschlossenen Tueren, ohne Beteiligung des demokratischen Souveraens und ohne Volksabstimmung gefaellt und fuer unumkehrbar erklaert.\nDasselbe Spiel mit den Vorbedingungen: Beim Euro waren es die Maastrichter Kriterien, die schon vor 1999 nicht erfuellt wurden und inzwischen offen missachtet werden. Die Tuerkei-Kriterien heissen: Wiedervereinigung Zyperns (als ob das so wichtig waere), Menschenrechte, Demokratisierung. Nichts hindert Ankara daran, diese Bedingungen pro forma zu erfuellen. Selbst wenn sie erfuellt wuerden, waeren damit die oben angefuehrten grundlegenden Argumente gegen den Tuerkei-Beitritt nicht im geringsten widerlegt.\nEin uebles Spiel, das den Verdacht naehrt, hier werde eine Verschwoerung gegen Deutschland und Europa angezettelt. Berlin hat sich ohne jedes Waehlermandat bereits festgelegt. Sollte der Beitritt scheitern, sagte Aussenminister Fischer laut 'WamS' vom 8. 2. 2004, wuerde man dafuer 'einen sehr hohen Preis zahlen'.\n\nEin Satz, den man zweimal lesen muss. Fischer droht dem deutschen Volk. Worin der hohe Preis bestehen wuerde, verschweigt er. Vielleicht meint er, dass die in Deutschland lebenden Tuerken auf die Strasse gehen koennten. Oder er fuerchtet den Zorn der USA, die den Beitritt seit Jahren verlangen. Washington weiss genau, dass die Aufnahme Kleinasiens zu einem 'bankrotten Halt' der gesamten EU (so die 'Financial Times' vom 15.1.2004) fuehren koennte. Ganz nuechtern urteilt die 'International Herald Tribune' am 24.11.2003:\n\n'Dass die Bevoelkerung in ganz Europa schrumpft, bedeutet, dass noch mehr Einwanderung bevorsteht. Die Aufnahme der Tuerkei als EU-Mitglied wuerde diesen Trend beschleunigen und die Definition Europas unwiderruflich aendern ? Viele Europaeer muessen erst noch akzeptieren, dass die traditionell weisse, christliche Kultur ihrer Vorfahren abgeloest wird von einem multikulturellen Mix mit einem starken islamischen Gewicht.'\n\n\n\n"

Hans-Werner Sinn, Praesident des ifo-Institut hat in der 'Sueddeutschen Zeitung' vor einer massiven Einwanderungswelle osteuropaeischer Sozialhilfe-Empfaenger nach Deutschland gewarnt. Zwar habe die EU Uebergangsfristen fuer Arbeitnehmer verankert, doch Erwerbslose duerften sofort einwandern und haetten von Anfang an 'Anspruch auf alle sozialen Leistungen'.\n\nDiese Regelung sei grotesk und werde die westeuropaeischen Sozialstaaten zerstoeren. Nur eine Aenderung der EU-Verfassung koenne das noch verhindern. Die Folgen der vom EU-Parlament gebilligten Freizuegigkeits-Richtlinie fuer Wanderungen innerhalb der EU seien 'von Politik und Oeffentlichkeit total uebersehen' worden, kritisierte der Wirtschaftswissenschaftler. Osteuropaeer duerfen waehrend einer mehrjaehrigen Uebergangsfrist zwar 'nicht als Arbeitnehmer kommen.\n\nAls Selbststaendige und nicht erwerbstaetige Personen duerfen sie sich jedoch sofort in Deutschland niederlassen', erklaerte Sinn. 'Von Anfang an hat auch der nicht Erwerbstaetige Anspruch auf alle sozialen Leistungen des Staates wie ein Einheimischer. Das wird viele, die in den aermeren Regionen Europas zu Hause sind, veranlassen, in die reichen Sozialstaaten der EU zu wandern.' Die Anreize seien uebermaechtig. Die deutsche Sozialhilfe sei fuenf Mal so hoch wie ein slowakischer Lohn.\n\nDie bevorstehende Armutswanderung aus Osteuropa werde die westeuropaeischen Sozialstaaten erodieren: 'Die Staaten werden ihre Leistungen in einer Art Abschreckungswettbewerb zurueckschrauben, weil keiner zum Ziel der Wohlfahrtswanderungen werden will', und 'im Endeffekt wird Europa nur noch so sozial sein koennen, wie es Amerika heute ist'. Um dies abzuwenden, muessten die EU-Staaten 'das Recht der Migration in den Sozialstaat' streichen: Das Heimatland muesste fuer die Sozialleistungen an nicht erwerbstaetige Zuwanderer zustaendig bleiben, forderte der ifo-Praesident.\n\n\nLink's:\nhttp://www.rp-online.de/public/article/nachrichten/politik/deutschland/48909\n\nhttp://www.rhein-main.net/sixcms/list.php?page=fnp2_news_article&id=1685544\n\n\n\n"

He was in charge of\nreviving royalties from the multi-national oil\ncompanies and government on behalf of the oil\nproducing\ncommunities in Nigeria.  After the hanging of the\nOgoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late\ndictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered\nstroke and died in August27th this year.  But before\nhis death, he called me and told me he has Twenty\nThree Million Five\nHundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars\n(USD23,560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially\ndeposited in a Security vault company here.\nHe advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who\nis the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he\nmarried.  My mother did not bear any male child for\nhim.  Which implies that all my father?s properties,\ncompanies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my\nmother has no male child according to African\nTradition.  My father therefore secretly gave me all\nthe relevant documents of the said money, and told me\nthat I should use this money with my mother and my\nyounger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if\nhe dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance.\nHe importantly advised me that I should seek foreign\nassistannce and that I should not invest this money\nhere in Nigeria because of his other wives and male\nchildren who happen to be my elders.  I am soliciting\nfor your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for\nus, where I will live with my mother and two younger\nsisters and further advise me where and how I will\ninvest the balance money overseas, possibly on\nproducts of your company and other profitable\nventures.\nI believe that by the special grace of God, you will\nhelp us move this money out of Nigeria to any country\nof your choice where we can invest this money\njudiciously with you.  You are entitled to a\nreasonable part of this money based on our agreement,\nand God will bless you as you help us.\nPLease reply through my e-mail\nLooking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nRegards.\n\nPrincess Grace Abonime .\n\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from Indiatimes at  http://email.indiatimes.com\nBuy the best in Movies at http://www.videos.indiatimes.com\nBid for Air Tickets @ Re.1 on Air Sahara Flights.

SAUDI ARABIA. \n\nWe are exporters of finished kaolin produce, with a 9years business \nexperience. \n\nOur kaolin is available in two different forms: POWDER or PELLETS. If the product is to be used in water-based systems such as paint, paper or ceramics, the clients could easily use the kaolin in its cheaper pellet form, as used by all our local customers in those industries. Rubber clients must have the dry powder form, however. (Note: Alkabir Ultrafine has recently replaced brands such as Hexafil and Suprex in the rubber industry and calcined clays in the paint industry in Saudi Arabia). \n\nWe fit 20 tons of kaolin per FCL when it is in the pellet form, palletised and shrinkwrapped. However with the more bulky powder, if the powder is palletised and shrinkwrapped, we can only fit 17.5 tons per FCL. (One can fit 20 tons per FCL if the bags are packed loose in the container, which needs a lot of labour to unpack). The Ultrafine is even more bulky so one can fit even less per FCL, as described below. We offer to supply your kaolin requirements as follows: (note: these prices do NOT include any commission for yourselves): \n\nProduct: ALKABIR FILLER GRADE kaolin (paper & rubber and general filler applications), or \nALKABIR PREMIUM GRADE kaolin (paint applications), or \nALKABIR CERAMIC GRADE kaolin (ceramic applications) \n\nQuantity: Full container lots \nPrice: in US$ per metric ton \nTerms: A prepayment by TT,wireless transfer or irrevocable confirmed L/C at sight. \nDelivery: Approximately 4 weeks from order \n\nPlease let me know whether I can be of further assistance.

            "content": "FROM: ROBERT TRANGURA\n\n\nDear friend,\n\nThis may come to you as a surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am Robert Tangura, the first son of Henry Tangura one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you.\n\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of USD$10 million (Ten million United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe  this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farmlands.\n\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims.\n\nIt is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father?s money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. \n\nI am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. As a businessman,I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa .But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. \n\nI have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also set  outside  5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above E-mail address, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. \n\n\nThanks, GOD BLESS \n\nMr  Robert Tangura\n\n\n\n"

I have a transaction which I think will be of mutual benefit to both of us. In my desire for a foreign partner with whom to do this transaction, I stumbled on your contact from a business\ndirectory. \n\nAs the head of accounts department of GBNP, I discovered some amount of money while I was auditing accounts for the 2003 financial year\nwhich has been lying there for over 3 years. On further inquiry, I discovered that this money totalling about USD$21.5 Million (twenty-one Million five hundred thousand United States Dollars) including accumulated interest belonged to one MR Michael Osterkamp ,a Germany Nationale who lived here and died intestate with no beneficiary.This man died through a plane crash of ADC airlines in 1998. \nI have Successfully secured the money and with the assistance of my colleague,the money has been moved out of my bank and deposited in a finances company. It was packed in three(2)metal trunk boxes as photographic materials.I would need your particulars to enable me prepare documents which will authenticate that the Consignment belongs to you as the next of kin to MR Michael Osterkamp and to enable you claim the money. \n\nI want to be assured of a safe account where the money will be deposited pending my arrival.This transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal complications,I have made all necessary arrangements for a successful transaction. Before this money is entrusted \ninto your care, there must be an agreement that will be  reached between us stating that: \n\n1.BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT FOR ANY REASON CHEAT EACH OTHER. \n2.BOTH PARTIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEE THIS TRANSACTION THROUGH. \n3.A HIGH DEGREE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE APPLIED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR WORK. \n4.I AND MY PARTNER WILL STRONGLY BE BY YOUR SIDE AS YOU \nCLAIM THIS FUND AND I AND MY PARTNER WILL ARRAGE AN \nATTORNEY(LAWYER)WHO WILL WORK ON YOUR BEHALF TO GET THE \nNECESSARY PAPERS NEEDED FOR A SMOOTH TRANSACTION. \n5.YOU WILL NOT DISAPPEAR WITH OUR FUND AFTER YOU \nHAVECLAIMED IT. \n6.DISBURSEMENT RATIO WILL BE 70 FOR ME AND MY \nCOLLEAGUE,15 FOR YOU, 5% WILL BE DONATED TO CHARITY,WHILE \n10% WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR MUTUALEXPENCES. \n\nThere is need for you to respond to this offer immediately as the government of my country have concluded plans to apply the money into arms procurement to project wars and unrest in African continent.I must let you know that a high degree of trust is required and also we will like to use our own share to go into any lucrative business with your help/assistance. \n\nAwaiting your urgent response now. \n\nYours Faithfully \nMr. Frank Williams.\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nObt?n gratis tu cuenta de correo en StarMedia Email. ?Reg?strate hoy mismo!. http://www.starmedia.com/email\n\n\n\n"

Up to the present time, changes in Unicode and\n>   amendments and additions to ISO/IEC 10646 have tracked each other, so\n>   that the character repertoires and code point assignments have\n>   remained in sync.  \n\n\"sync\" -> \"synchrony\" (proper English).  This is true only for the\nlast few years, and applies only to 10646 editions, and Unicode major\nversions.  The amendments and minor versions of Unicode have a more\ncomplex relationship. Suggested new text: \"Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646\nare kept synchronised, so that the character repertoires and code\npoint assignments are the same for similarly timed versions/editions\nof these standards.\"\n\n>   assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number,\n\nCalled \"code position\" in 10646.  The term \"character number\" is wrong!\nCode positions (also when represented in UTF-8) need not represent\ncharacters (in some version of 10646/Unicode), but may be unassigned\n(in some version), or for non-characters.  This does not mean that\nsuch code positions are excluded from being encoded in UTF-8. (So\nyou need to reformulate a bit more than just correcting the term.)\n\n>   o  The octet values C0, C1, FE and FF never appear. If the range of\n>      character numbers is restricted to U+0000..U+10FFFF (the UTF-16\n>      accessible range), then the octet values F5..FD also never appear.\n\nSince this restriction is in force also for UTF-8, simply say that\nC0, C1, F5-FF never occur in well-formed UTF-8 data.\n\nIn addition (in a separate point, for clarity), for well-formed\nUTF-8, E0 will not be followed by a byte less than or equal to 9F,\nED will not be followed by a byte greater than or equal to A0, F0\nwill not be followed by a byte less than or equal to 8F, and F4 will\nnot be followed by a byte greater than or equal to 90 (hexadecimal).\n\n>   o  The lexicographic sorting order of UTF-8 strings is the same as if\n\nSay \"binary order\" (nothing about sorting, and not unqualified).\n\n>      ordered by character numbers.  Of course this is of limited\n\nIt may be of use for internal data representation purposes (like search\ntrees).\n\n>   UCS characters are designated by the U+HHHH notation, where HHHH is a\n>   string of from 4 to 6 hexadecimal digits representing the character\n>   number in ISO/IEC 10646.\n\n...in shortest form (though no less than 4 digits).\n\n>   formulae can also be found in Annex D of ISO/IEC 10646-1 [ISO.10646]\n\nThis reference should be dated, since the annex numbers/letters may\ndiffer between editions of 10646 (or the annex reference number deleted).\n\n>   Encoding a character to UTF-8 proceeds as follows:\n\nUTF-8 is algorithmic, and does not depend on whether a given code\nposition is for a *character* or not.  However the given code has to be\na Unicode scalar value (not a surrogate code point, nor above 10FFFF).\nBut it is an error to try to encode a value that is not a Unicode\nscalar value.  The latter should be explicitly pointed out.\n\n>   encoding form (as surrogate pairs) and do not directly represent\n>   characters. \n\nPlease maintain the distinction between code positions (scalar values)\nand characters.  Not all scalar values represent characters.  I agree\nthat it is unfortunate that Unicode and 10646 do not use exactly the\nsame terminology though.\n\n>   Decoding a UTF-8 character proceeds as follows:\n\nPlease maintain distinctions between character, scalar value\n(code position), and code unit sequence.  Decoding a UTF-8 code\nunit sequence can lead to a *sequence* of code positions, some\nmay be for characters, some for non-characters, and some for\nunassigned code positions.\n\n>   Implementations of the decoding algorithm above MUST protect against\n>   decoding invalid sequences.  For instance, a naive implementation may\n>   decode the overlong UTF-8 sequence C0 80 into the character U+0000,\n>   or the surrogate pair ED A1 8C ED BE B4 into U+233B4. Decoding\n>   invalid sequences may have security consequences or cause other\n>   problems.\n\nThis can be read as it is ok to silently drop ill-formed subsequences.\nBut that is definitely not ok, since that can lead to security issues.\n\n>   UTF8-octets = *( UTF8-char )\n>\n>   UTF8-char   = UTF8-1 / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4\n\nAs mentioned, this need not encode a character (so the \"-char\"\nis misleading).\n\n>   UTF8-1      = %x00-7F\n>\n>   UTF8-2      = %xC2-DF UTF8-tail\n>\n>   UTF8-3      = %xE0    %xA0-BF UTF8-tail / \n>                 %xE1-EC 2( UTF8-tail ) /\n>                 %xED    %x80-9F UTF8-tail /\n>                 %xEE-EF 2( UTF8-tail )\n>\n>   UTF8-4      = %xF0 %x90-BF 2( UTF8-tail ) /\n>                 %xF1-F3 3( UTF8-tail ) /\n>                 %xF4 %x80-8F 2( UTF8-tail )\n>\n>   UTF8-tail   = %x80-BF\n\n(I've added some newlines and spaces above to make the text somewhat\neasier to read.)\n\n>   can be used as a genuine \"ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE\" within text, but\n\nPreferably, WORD JOINER should be used as a zero-width no-break space,\nnot the character ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE, despite the name!\nThis should be taken up early in this section.\n\n>   initial character as a hint that the stream consists of UCS\n\nThe initial 3 *octets*, *not* the initial character.  It actually the \noctet sequence that acts as a signature, NOT the character so encoded\nper se (decoding it to a character happens later, and the BOM character\ncannot act as \"signature\", it's the same for all encoding forms).\n\n>   It is important to understand that the character U+FEFF appearing at\n>   any position other than the beginning of a stream MUST be interpreted\n>   with the semantics for the zero-width non-breaking space, and MUST\n>   NOT be interpreted as a signature. When interpreted as a signature,\n>   the Unicode standard suggests than an initial U+FEFF character may be\n>   stripped before processing the text. Such stripping is necessary in\n>   some cases (e.g. when concatenating two strings, because otherwise\n>   the resulting string may contain an unintended \"ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK\n\nHmmm, part of the intent of using this particular character as a basis\nfor signatures, is that a zero-width no-break space would not be very\ndisruptive even if kept; it has no visible width, it does not signify\nany additional break point (so it works like NO BREAK HERE...).  And it\nis a slightly smaller security issue if NOT deleted, even if at the\nbeginning of something (unclear what that something is; consider HTTP\nor even more to the point SMTP/MIME (after the headings, and inside\nsome of the headings...)).\n\n>   U+FEFF in the first position of a stream MAY be interpreted as a\n>   zero-width non-breaking space, and is not always a signature. In an\n>   attempt at diminishing this uncertainty, Unicode 3.2 adds a new\n>   character, U+2060 \"WORD JOINER\", with exactly the same semantics and\n>   usage as U+FEFF except for the signature function, and strongly\n>   recommends its exclusive use for expressing word-joining semantics.\n>   Eventually, following this recommendation will make it all but\n>   certain that any initial U+FEFF is a signature, not an intended \"ZERO\n>   WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE\".\n\nMove this to earlier in this section.\n\n>   Implementers of UTF-8 need to consider the security aspects of how\n>   they handle illegal UTF-8 sequences.  \n\n\"illegal\" -> \"ill-formed\" (through-out); There is no point in having\nTHREE terminologies for the same things.  Can we please try to converge\nto ONE terminology for these Unicode/10646 matters.  Similarly,\n\"byte\" -> \"octet\" through-out.\n\nIt is not just ill-formed UTF-8 sequences that may lead to security\nproblems.  Here's a list (no claim of completeness):\n\nILL-FORMED UTF-8 SUBSEQUENCES (that aren't part of well-formed\nUTF-8 subsequences):\nThese MUST NOT be silently deleted by a decoder.\nThe error indication for ill-formed subsequences\nshould not be easy to ignore.\nNote that there are ill-formed subsequences\nthat never have been properly decodable to code\npoints, e.g. too short sequences, and isolated\ncontinuation octets.  Note that, e.g., \".<ill-fmd>.\" -> \"..\"\nmay cause a security problem.\n(The editor is of course free to expand on this,\nI'm NOT suggesting wording here!)\n\nBOM:\nMUST NOT be deleted by a decoder. (See the next point.)\n\nNON-CHARACTERS, UNASSIGNED, DEFAULT_IGNORABLES incl. ZWNBSP:\nThese MUST NOT be deleted by a decoder.  Deleting\nany character may, like replacing ill-formed sequenced\nwith the empty string of characters, lead to security\nproblems.  Non-characters are not intended to be\nexchanged across \"systems\" (with an undefined meaning\nof \"system\"), but that does not imply that a recipient\nmay delete them immediately when received, esp. when in\na security sensitive context.\n\nNLF (new line function), SPACES, OTHER SYNTACTIC ELEMENTS:\nNote that security scanning may assume a different\nsyntax than a subsequent interpreter. E.g. if the\n\"scanner\" only recognises SPACE and TAB as \"whitespace\",\nthe division into elements may be quite different\nif a subsequent interpreter recognises also all\ncategory Zs characters as spaces.  This problem is not\nnew to Unicode, since the problem with CR, LF, CR+LF,\nNEL, FF, and VT is present also for other character\nencodings, but Unicode adds PS (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR)\nand LS (LINE SEPARATOR) to this set.\n\nNORMALISATION\nIf a security scan does not handle normalisation\nin the same way as a subsequent interpreter, security\nproblems may arise.  E.g. if \"Kovert\" is an access\nrestricted folder, if the source uses the KELVIN SIGN\nfor the K, the security scan may miss that \"Kovert\"\nis accessed if the actual access uses any normalisation.\n\nCHECKSUMS and DIGITAL SIGNATURES\nAny change will corrupt the document signed (or just\nchecksummed), so any kind of normalisation (e.g.)\nmust be done before the signature (or checksum) is\ncomputed, otherwise the signature/checksum will be\ninvalidated.  Similarly for the insertion/deletion\nof BOM, non-characters, etc.\n\nFALLBACKS\nFallbacks should not be used within the UCS (but\nthat is sometimes done anyway), but is commonly used\nwhen converting to another character encoding. Note that\nin either case, fallbacks may give rise to security problems.\nE.g., if <two-dot leader> is \"felled back\" to \"..\", or if \nany unconvertable character is felled back to \"?\" (which in\nsome circumstances is interpreted as matching any character).\n\n>   a parser which performs security-critical validity checks against the\n>   UTF-8 encoded form of its input, but interprets certain illegal octet\n>   sequences as characters.\n\n\"characters\" -> \"zero or more characters\".  A UTF-8 decoder MUST NOT\nsilently remove ill-formed subsequences, but MAY nevertheless (still\ntogether with an error indication) replace each with a code that\nindicates that there may have been an encoding error (together\nwith another error indication). Note that U+001A SUBSTITUTE is a control\ncode which exist for that specific purpose (but for any encoding).\n\n>   o  Made Unicode the source of the normative definition of UTF-8,\n>      keeping ISO/IEC 10646 as the reference for characters.\n\nI fail to see the point in this forking.\n\n>   [UNICODE]  The Unicode Consortium, \"The Unicode Standard -- Version\n>              3.2\",  defined by The Unicode Standard, Version 3.0\n>              (Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley, 2000.

This\ntransaction involves the\ntransfer of huge sum of foreign exchange (the United States Dollars)\nto a foreign account. There were a series of contracts\nexecuted by a Consortium\nof Multinationals in the oil industry in favour of NNPC among which are:\n(1) The expansion and rehabilitation of the ageing pipeline network within\nNigeria for crude oil and downstream\nproducts distribution and evacuation - US$9 Billion\n(2) Contracts for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the four epileptic\nrefineries in the country\n(3) The construction of more storage tanks and maintenance and servicing\nof old ones for Petroleum Products Storage (Depots) - US$90 Million\n(4) The construction of Escravos Gas Poduction Offshore facility.\nThe original value of these contracts was deliberately over-invoiced\nin the sum of USD Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand\n($18,500,000.00) by this\ncommittee (CRPAC) during the awards of the various contract. This sum\n($18,500,000.00) has now been approved for payment by this committee\n(CRPAC)and is now ready to be transfered by the Central Bank\nof Nigeria to the account of any individual and or company which the\nCRPAC presents as the beneficiary, since the company that actually\nexecuted these contracts has\nbeen fully paid their fund and the projects have been officialy\ncommissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to\ntransfer the total amount\nto your account for subsequent disbursement on our behalf, since we as\ncivil servants and we are also serving in a sensitive\nforeign payment approval committee (CRPAC) are prohibited by the Code of\nConduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening or operating foreign\naccount and or dealing in\nforeign exchange in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on\nyou at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed\nto offer you 25% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for\nincidental expenses (internal and external) accrued between the parties\nin the course of the transaction. The balance will be used to purchase\nagricultural equipment and\nmedical drugs from your country for importation back to my country. You\nmust however note that this transaction is subject to the following terms\nand conditions: a) Our conviction of your transparent\nhonesty and diligence\nb) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and\nconfidentiality c) That you have an unflincing trust in us, and our\nability to complete all official processes with your co-operation.\n(d) That the funds would be transfered to an ordinary account which you\nhave total control over.\nModalities have been worked out (secretly) at the highest levels of the\nrelevant government departments involved and the Central Bank of Nigeria\nfor the immediate transfer of funds within 14 working days\nsubject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our\nassurance is that your role is\nrisk-free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for\nmutual security of the fund, the whole approval procedures will be\nofficially and legally processed with your name or the\nname of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary, as in\nan ideal situation.It\nis imperative that you bear in mind that having put in 19 years in the\nservice of the government, I am averse to having my image and career\ndented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost\nsecrecy and urgency.\nKindly expedite action by contacting me on my e-mail address, indicating\nyour interest in this transaction. For swift response to your reply,\nkindly indicate your fax and telephone numbers clearly so\nthat I can explain further, especially by fax. I am urgently waiting\nyour reply as payment to\nforeign contractors is usually made on quarterly basis.\n\nYours faithfully,\nDr David Idama\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"

Naps.\nTEL: 234-80-23513636\n                     \n                  \n                                                 REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE\n\nI am Mr. Dayo Naps, an official with one of the APEX banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent and very confidential \nbusiness  proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 \n(Twenty-eight Million, Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but \ngot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On \nfurther investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he \nhad none.\n\nWe therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official \ndocuments in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at \nthe end of every year.\nAs it is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the \nmoney will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. \nConsequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all we need is some of \nyour details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of \nan accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of \nprobate/administration in your favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.\nThere is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the \nsuccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall still require your \nassistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our share . \n\nAwaiting your urgent reply.\n\nMr.Dayo Naps\n234-80-235-13636 \n\nNB: Endeavor to contact me on my number as time is of the essence to commence and concIude this transaction\n\n\n\n"

Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. \n\nOn June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Paul Nick Myers made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$7,000,000.00 (seven Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to him forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Paul Nick Myers died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. \n\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Nick Myers did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$7,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. \n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Nick Myers so that the fruits of this man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorneys will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys to process and notarization all the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor in order for the transfer to take place. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. \n\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorneys and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below.

I am writing this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carry out this \nbusiness opportunity in my department.We discovered an abandoned sum of $25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane crash. Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. \n\nUnfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund. We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus: 15% for you as my foreign partner, 70% for us the officials in my department and 15 % for the source of financing all local and foreign expences to be incurred by us and you during the course of this business.\n \nUpon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues will come to your country and \nmind our share. It is from our 70 % we intend to invest in (estate) and import Agricultural Machineries into my country as a way of recycling the fund. To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made. Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of its nature. I look forward to receiving your prompt response. \n\nYours faithfully, \n\nSONI MOJE\nCITIBANK N.A.NIGERIA\n\n\n\n"

Each octet\nMUST have value between 0 and 177 octal, inclusive. Octets with values 0\nthrough 15 octal (inclusive) and 20 through 177 octal (inclusive) are to be\ninterpreted per one of two Coded Character Sets (CCS's): ISO_646.irv:1983 and\nISO_5427. The CCS to use is determined by the switch state. Octet with value 16\noctal selects ISO_5427 and octet with value 17 octal selects ISO_646.irv:1983.\nThe initial CCS is ISO_646.irv:1983.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE: This charset was used in Soviet computer systems as a\nreplacement for ASCII. It was intended to do for Soviet computer systems what\nASCII does for American ones. The only additional feature required by the\nformer is encoding of Russian letters. To achieve the above goal Soviet\nstandards defined several 7-bit charsets, all of which were called KOI-7.\nKOI-7 N0 was the Soviet name for ISO 646 IRV, which is the same as US-ASCII\nexcept for rendering 44 octal as the international currency symbol instead of\nthe dollar sign, and KOI-7 N1 (registered as ISO_5427) had English letters and\nsome special characters replaced with Russian letters. The two KOI-7 CCS's were\ncommonly used with the CES described above to achieve functionality which is a\nsuperset of ASCII and Russian.\n\nAn ISO 2022 compliant terminal can be prepared for displaying KOI7-switched\ntext with the following sequence:\n\nESC ( @ ESC ) N LS0\n\nAdditional information:\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n\nMichael Sokolov\nInternational Free Computing Task Force (IFCTF)\nmsokolov@ivan.Harhan.ORG\n\nIntended usage: LIMITED USE\n\nThis charset is not as convenient as the several 8-bit CCS's available for\nLatin/Cyrillic encoding, however, when a 7-bit communication channel must be\nused using this charset is much more efficient than using an 8-bit CCS such as\nISO_8859-5 or KOI-8 and then encoding it with a scheme such as uuencode, MIME\nbase64, or MIME quoted-printable.\n\n\n\n"

This is true only for the\nlast few years, and applies only to 10646 editions, and Unicode major\nversions.  The amendments and minor versions of Unicode have a more\ncomplex relationship. Suggested new text: \"Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646\nare kept synchronised, so that the character repertoires and code\npoint assignments are the same for similarly timed versions/editions\nof these standards.\"\n\n>   assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646 (the character number,\n\nCalled \"code position\" in 10646.  The term \"character number\" is wrong!\nCode positions (also when represented in UTF-8) need not represent\ncharacters (in some version of 10646/Unicode), but may be unassigned\n(in some version), or for non-characters.  This does not mean that\nsuch code positions are excluded from being encoded in UTF-8. (So\nyou need to reformulate a bit more than just correcting the term.)\n\n>   o  The octet values C0, C1, FE and FF never appear.

However the given code has to be\na Unicode scalar value (not a surrogate code point, nor above 10FFFF).\nBut it is an error to try to encode a value that is not a Unicode\nscalar value.

Decoding a UTF-8 code\nunit sequence can lead to a *sequence* of code positions, some\nmay be for characters, some for non-characters, and some for\nunassigned code positions.\n\n>   Implementations of the decoding algorithm above MUST protect against\n>   decoding invalid sequences.

Can we please try to converge\nto ONE terminology for these Unicode/10646 matters.  Similarly,\n\"byte\" -> \"octet\" through-out.\n\nIt is not just ill-formed UTF-8 sequences that may lead to security\nproblems.  Here's a list (no claim of completeness):\n\nILL-FORMED UTF-8 SUBSEQUENCES (that aren't part of well-formed\nUTF-8 subsequences):\nThese MUST NOT be silently deleted by a decoder.\nThe error indication for ill-formed subsequences\nshould not be easy to ignore.\nNote that there are ill-formed subsequences\nthat never have been properly decodable to code\npoints, e.g. too short sequences, and isolated\ncontinuation octets.  Note that, e.g., \".<ill-fmd>.\" -> \"..\"\nmay cause a security problem.\n(The editor is of course free to expand on this,\nI'm NOT suggesting wording here!)\n\nBOM:\nMUST NOT be deleted by a decoder. (See the next point.)\n\nNON-CHARACTERS, UNASSIGNED, DEFAULT_IGNORABLES incl. ZWNBSP:\nThese MUST NOT be deleted by a decoder.  Deleting\nany character may, like replacing ill-formed sequenced\nwith the empty string of characters, lead to security\nproblems.  Non-characters are not intended to be\nexchanged across \"systems\" (with an undefined meaning\nof \"system\"), but that does not imply that a recipient\nmay delete them immediately when received, esp. when in\na security sensitive context.\n\nNLF (new line function), SPACES, OTHER SYNTACTIC ELEMENTS:\nNote that security scanning may assume a different\nsyntax than a subsequent interpreter. E.g. if the\n\"scanner\" only recognises SPACE and TAB as \"whitespace\",\nthe division into elements may be quite different\nif a subsequent interpreter recognises also all\ncategory Zs characters as spaces.  This problem is not\nnew to Unicode, since the problem with CR, LF, CR+LF,\nNEL, FF, and VT is present also for other character\nencodings, but Unicode adds PS (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR)\nand LS (LINE SEPARATOR) to this set.\n\nNORMALISATION\nIf a security scan does not handle normalisation\nin the same way as a subsequent interpreter, security\nproblems may arise.  E.g. if \"Kovert\" is an access\nrestricted folder, if the source uses the KELVIN SIGN\nfor the K, the security scan may miss that \"Kovert\"\nis accessed if the actual access uses any normalisation.\n\nCHECKSUMS and DIGITAL SIGNATURES\nAny change will corrupt the document signed (or just\nchecksummed), so any kind of normalisation (e.g.)\nmust be done before the signature (or checksum) is\ncomputed, otherwise the signature/checksum will be\ninvalidated.  Similarly for the insertion/deletion\nof BOM, non-characters, etc.\n\nFALLBACKS\nFallbacks should not be used within the UCS (but\nthat is sometimes done anyway), but is commonly used\nwhen converting to another character encoding.

            "content": "Dear Friend,\n\nNaturally this mail will come to you as a surprise, but if I may crave your indulgence, I'm MR. RUFUS GABA, the first son of DODI GABA, the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I APOLOGISE FOR INVADING YOUR PRIVACY, BUT PLEASE, I appeal to you to exercise a little patience and read through my letter, and I guarantee you will not have wasted your time.\n\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 Million (Eight Million, Five Hundred United States dollars) in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. Infact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims.\n\nIt is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in Madrid Spain where we are seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father?s money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the Spainish Law  prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Spain, as the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them.\n\nI am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds) from their affiliated office here in spain as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to Spain from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place e.g change of ownership to the consignment.I intend to use this money for investment in any country of your choice.\n\nI have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country.\n\nI implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.\n\nThanks, GOD BLESS YOU\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nRufus Gaba.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\n\n\n\n"

My colleagues and I would like to solicit your kindness in assisting us to champion the transfer of some fund from our country to yours for safe keeping. The total amount of fund is US$35million (Thirty-five Million United States\nDollars only).\n\nSOURCE OF THIS FUND:\n\nWith our positions as members of the Federal Tenders' Board in charge of Contract Award and Monitoring. We were able to successfully secure this Contract valued at US$350,000,000.00 (THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS only) from the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing (F.M.W.H.) for a Foreign based Multi-national company. This contract has been fully executed and the Foreign contractor have already received their payments from the Federal Ministry of\nWorks & Housing.\n\nHowever, before the contract was awarded, we had understanding(i.e. agreement)with officials of this Foreign Multi-national company for a commission of 10% (TEN PERCENT) of the Total contract sum of\nUS$350,000,000.00(THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS\nonly). This 10% amounting to US$35,000,000 (THIRTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ) is due for payment to a foreign account of our choice. This amount is owned by myself and my two other colleagues in the Federal Tenders' Board in charge of Contract Award and Monitoring. As a matter of fact we succeeded in transferring part of this over-invoiced funds precisely, US$5M (Five Million US Dollars Only) into a foreign account in Ukraine. But the provider of the account in Ukraine is up to some mischief and has refused to comply with our initial agreement insisting that the total amount be paid into his bank account before disbursement will take place. We have losts confidence\nand trust in our Ukrainian \"Friend\" because if for mere US$5Million we were not compensated, is it when the balance of US$30Million is transferred that we will be sure of our full share in the deal. We therefore seek your assistance so that the remaining amount US$30Million can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your account.\n\nBasically, you would be required to nominate a suitable Bank Account that will conveniently accommodate the total fund. Account could be a fresh or an already existing one, and could be individual or\ncorporate account. All necessary arrangement have been made for the transfer of the funds into your account which they are awaiting for your above mentioned details to enable us make proper documentation of the payments in your favour and apply for the transfer of the funds into your account. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TRANSFER OPERATION WILL TAKE SEVEN TO TEN WORKING DAYS TO BE COMPLETED. I would need your personal assurance that you would not sit on the money when its finally get into your account.\n\nSHARING MODALITIES:\nYou shall be entitled to 25% of this fund for your envisaged efforts and assistance rendered. 5% shall be used to settle any expenses both you and I shall make at the course of this transaction. The remaining 70% will be for myself and my other colleagues.\n\nThis proposal is strictly confidential, free from any form of risk and does not depend on any particular field of trade to prosecute. It however requires your adequate participation and support to enable its\naccomplishment on schedule.\n\nI will require to email me with your decision.I shall immediately send to you the details of this transaction as soon as i receive your email of sincere interest to fully assist us in this transaction.\n\nThanks in anticipation and God bless.\n\nSincere regards,\n\nMr Willaims Okito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\n\n\n\n"

Freetown. According\n to my father. This money was\n \n the  income acquired from mining co-operation's over\n draft and minor sales.\n Before the  peak of the civil war between the rebels\n forces of major Paul Koroma\n \n and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping\n operation that almost destroyed\n \n My country, following the forceful removal from\n power of the Civilian Elected\n President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My\n father had already made\n arrangement for his family, my mother, my little\n sister and myself to be\n evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our\n personal effects.\n \n My father deposited the fund in the BANK until after\n the war when he will join\n us. During the war  in my  country, and following\n the indiscriminate looting of\n public and Government properties by the rebel \n forces, the sierra Leone mining\n coop. Was one of the targets looted and destroyed.\n My father including other top\n \n Government functionaries Were attacked and killed by\n the rebels in November 1999\n \n because of his relationship with the civilian \n Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.\n \n As a result of my\n father death, and with the news of my uncles \n involvement in air crash in\n January, dashed\n our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my\n mothers heart failure and\n other related complications of which she later died\n in the hospital After we\n must have spent a lot of money on her.\n \n Now my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in\n this strange country suffering\n \n without any care or help. Without any relation, we\n are now like refugees and\n orphans. Our only hope now is in this fund which our\n father deposited in the\n BANK To this effect, I humbly solicit your\n assistance in the followings ways. To\n \n assist me claim this fund  from the BANK as\n co-beneficiary. To transfer this\n money in your name to your country.\n To make a good arrangement for a joint business\n investment on our behalf in your\n \n country and you being the caretaker. To secure a\n college for my little sister\n and my self\n in your country to further our education. And to\n make arrangement for our travel\n \n to meet you face to face in your country after you\n have transferred this fund.\n Most importantly. The whole documents issued after\n deposit are in my custody.\n For your assistance, I\n beg to concede 20% of  this money to you for your\n efforts and assistance.  \n\n\n Please include your phone/fax number on reply.so\n that i can send all the necessary documents to you.\n\n Thanks and God bless.\n \n Best regards,\n \n SonnyLaye and Sister.\n \n\n\n\n"

            "content": " ATTENTION:DEAR SIR \nI received encouraging information about you and how trust worthy you are. I am delighted with such a useful information.The purpose of my introduction is that I am Mr. Abu Conte, the first son of Late Abu Conte Garba one of the most popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of USD$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this funds was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the security and finance company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland. \nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Spain where we are seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my fathers money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Spanish prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Spanish, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where these funds could be transferred witho\n ut the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. \nI am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security and finance company to clear the consignment(funds) from any of their affiliated office as I have already given directives for the consignment should be brought from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the funds for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnersh\n ip with me for the proper profitable investment of the funds in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. And also please be kind to clarify the following: 1. Can your account accommodate this fund in your local bank without government intervention or do you have an account outside your country where you may consider safe for this fund. 2. What are taxation in your country as I desire a low/free tax zone. 3. What are interest rates on long/short term fixed deposit in your local banks. 4. What other lucrative investments would you suggest as I intend banking, real estate and import/export investments. 5. Can you be able to make residential documents and purchase \n a house for me and my family to relocate and settle in your country. Contact me with this E-mail address mamaufuma@yahoo.es or call me on 34 680125031, FAX: 0034917195164 while I want you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. \nNote:your prompt response will be appreciated. \nThanks, GOD BLESS \nYours Faithfully, \nCONTE ABU GARBA.\n\n\n\n"

Though l know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but l am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your discreteness and ability in transactions of this nature.

Valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank Plc to get in touch with any of the Baker's family or relatives but there has been no success till date. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of late Engr. Theophilus Baker's next-of-kin (he had no wife nor children that is known to us). The management under the influence of our Chairman and member of the board of directors, retired Chie\n f Kalu Uke. Kalu, that an arrangement has been made for the funds to be declared \"UNCLAIMABLE\" \nand subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues and l now seek your permission to have you stand as a next-of-kin to the late Engr. Thoephilus Baker so that the fund USD$31.5Million would be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next-of-kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out.

            "content": "Good Day,\nwith warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.\nMy name is GODWIN NDULOVO, the son of ZHIRI , a farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.\nThe purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers, all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea.\nHe then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm.\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit totaling Ten million five hundred thousand united state dollars. [10.5m] Kept in custody\nfor us in a security company unknown to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal belongings. This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.\nThis violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of my beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe with the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but all to no avail.\n I am seeking political  asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because\nthe security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in Johannesburg here, which they have since done.\nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial\ntransaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, hence this proposal to you.\nYou have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposited iteams , as it has now been transferred  from Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch in Europe. The company will be legally informed of you representing me.\nFor your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have 15.5% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money\nin your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply.\nI have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 15.5% for your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left in the account here for me.\nPlease, I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.\nYour reply should be sent to my private email address only\ngodwinzhirijn@netscape.net\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in\nadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.\nSincerely,\nGODWIN ZHIRI NDULOVO.\ngodwinzhirijn@netscape.net\nPLEASE YOU  CAN READ ABOUT PROBLEMS IN ZIMBABWE FROM\nTHE LINKS BELOW.\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/918781.stm\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/715001.stm\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1063785.stm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

BY MY COMMITTEE.\nThis contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 21.5Million Dollars. This was done delibrately. The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.\nWe now want to transfer this money, which is in a suspense account with the P.T.F. into any oversea account, which we expect you to provide for us.\nShare:\n60 % of the money would be for my partners and I.\n30 % of the money would be yours, for providing us with logistics, which, would include a safe bank account, where we shall facilitate funds transfer into, as soon as documentations are concluded over here.\n10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction, (both local and international expenses).\nIf interested in assisting us, please contact me via my secured email address, as soon as possible (mikeefosa@hknetmail.com) \nIt may interest you to know that a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, President of Crane International Trading Corp., of 153 East 57th St., 28th floor, N.Y.10022, Telephone: 212-308-7788 and Telex: 6731689. The deal was concluded and all covering documents, forwarded to Mr. Miller to authenticate the claims. Once the funds were transferred, Mr. Miller presented to his bank, all the legal documents and remitted the whole funds to another bank account, and disappeared completely. My colleagues and I were shattered, since such opportunities are not easy to come by.\nPlease, if you are interested in assisting us carry out to the fullest capacity, this transaction, we would require the following information from you which would enable us make formal application to the various ministries / parastatals, for the release and onward transfer of the money to your account.\n1.Your Full Name, Company's Name, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers.\n2.Your Bank Name, Address. Telephone and Fax Number.\n3.Your Bank Account Number and Beneficiary Name - You must be the signatory.\nPlease, note that we have strong and reliable connections at the Central Bank  and other Government Parastatals, hence assistance in this regards, would not be a problem.\nAt the conclusion of this transaction, we shall use same contacts to withdraw all documents used in the course of this, to avoid any trace whatsoever that may ever arise, to you or to us, now and in the nearest possible future.\nIt might also interest you to know that we are mere civil servants who do not want to miss this opportunity, hence, we want this money transferred out, as soon as possible, before the newly democratically elected government ever think of making enquiries as regards the various activities of the past military government.\nKindly contact me as soon as possible, whether or not you are interested in this deal, so that whereby you are not interested, it would give us more room to scout for another partner. But if you are interested, kindly contact me via above email, so that we can swing into action, as time is not on our part.\nI await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.\nYours Faithfully,\nDr.Mike Efosa\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

I am married to Mr. Kazeem Hatch who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2001.    We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.6Million (Ten Million six hundred   thousand U.S. Dollars) with one Pinnacle Finance/Security Company in Spain. Presently, this money is still \nwith the Security  Company. \n\nRecently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund churches, orphanages,Research centers and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure   that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. \n\nI took this decision because I dont have any child that will  inherit this \nmoney and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my \nhusbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a \nsituation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the \nreason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know \nwhere I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. \nExodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Pinnacle Finance/Security Company  in spain . I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. \n\nI want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my \nshephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this   same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I  stated herein. Hoping to hear from you. \nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord. \n\nYours in christ,\nMrs  Magreth Hatch \n\n\n\n"

I got your contact from the net during my personal search ,after thorough deliberations,my colleagues and I decided to contact you for a very confidential and profitable business transaction of mutual benefit.\nDuring our verification exercise, we came across an over-invoiced contract(Contract No: NNPC/PED/1473/97). This contract was awarded in July,1996 and completed in August, 1998, and the original contractor has since been paid his contract sum leaving the over-invoiced sum of US$35.5m(Thirty- Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) This amount have been left floating in our account with the federation bank, until our recent discovery.\nMy coleagues and I have decided to seek for the assistance of a reliable  foreign partner into whose account the fund will be transferred into for our own use. If this proposal is acceptable to you, a ?Deed of Transfer? of the above contract will be obtained on your behalf, to empower you as the legal beneficiary of the contract and the sum to be transferred. All necessary and relevant documents will be procured for the release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.\nAn application for foreign exchange allocation will be made on your behalf from my office to the federal ministry of finance (FMF) and the federation bank for the subsequent release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.Be informed that we are working in collaboration with top officials of the federal ministry of finance and the federation bank, who will assist us in the transfer of the fund. With your cooperation the success of this transaction is guaranteed.\nWe have agreed to compensate you with 30%of the total sum, 60% will be for me and my colleagues here, while the remaining 10% have been mapped-out for miscellaneous expenses that might be incurred by both parties during the course of this transaction. All things being equal, this transaction will be concluded within 6 working days upon the day of receipt of your response. You are required to email us your nominated bank account details and your direct telephone and fax numbers. Please treat this transaction with top priority and remember to keep it as confidential as possible.\nAs soon as we receive your response by telephone call or through my email beneast@mail.gr, more details about how to proceed will be given to you. \nBest Regards,\nDr. Benjamin Orji\n\n\n\napplication/octet-stream attachment: 2man.txt\n\n\n\n\n"

My colleagues and I would like to solicit your kindness in assisting us to champion the transfer of some fund from our\ncountry to yours for safe keeping. The total amount of fund is US$35million (Thirty-five Million United States Dollars only).\n\nSOURCE OF THIS FUND:\n\nWith our positions as members of the Federal Tenders' Board in charge of Contract Award and Monitoring. We were able to successfully secure this Contract valued at US$350,000,000.00 (THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS only) from the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing (F.M.W.H.)\nfor a Foreign based Multi-national company. This contract has been fully executed and the Foreign contractor have already received their payments from the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing.\n\nHowever, before the contract was awarded, we had understanding(i.e. agreement)with officials of this Foreign Multi-national company for a commission of 10% (TEN PERCENT) of the Total contract sum of US$350,000,000.00(THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS only). This 10% amounting to US$35,000,000 (THIRTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES\nDOLLARS ) is due for payment to a foreign account of our choice. This amount is owned by myself and my two other colleagues in the Federal Tenders' Board in charge of Contract Award and Monitoring. As a matter of fact we succeeded\nin transferring part of this over-invoiced funds precisely, US$5M (Five Million US Dollars Only) into a foreign account in Ukraine. But the provider of the account in Ukraine is up to some mischief and has refused to comply with our initial agreement insisting that the total amount be paid into\nhis bank account before disbursement will take place. We have losts confidence and trust in our Ukrainian \"Friend\" because if for mere US$5Million we were not compensated, is it when the balance of US$30Million is transferred that we will be sure\nof our full share in the deal. We therefore seek your\nassistance so that the remaining amount US$30Million can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your account.\n\nBasically, you would be required to nominate a suitable Bank Account that will conveniently accommodate the total fund. Account could be a fresh or an already existing one, and could be individual or corporate account. All necessary arrangement have been made for the transfer of the funds into your account which they are awaiting for your above mentioned\ndetails to enable us make proper documentation of the payments in your favour and apply for the transfer of the funds into your account. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE TRANSFER OPERATION WILL TAKE SEVEN TO TEN WORKING DAYS TO BE COMPLETED. I would need your personal assurance that you would not sit on the money when its finally\nget into your account.\n\nSHARING MODALITIES:\nYou shall be entitled to 25% of this fund for your envisaged efforts and assistance rendered. 5% shall be used to settle any expenses both you and I shall make at the course of this transaction. The remaining 70% will be for myself and my other colleagues.\n\nThis proposal is strictly confidential, free from any form of risk and does not depend on any particular field of trade to prosecute. It however requires your adequate participation and support to enable its accomplishment on schedule.\n\nI will require to email me with your decision.I shall immediately send to you the details of this transaction as soon as i receive your email of sincere interest to fully assist us in this transaction.\n\nThanks in anticipation and God bless.\n\nSincere regards,\n\nMr Willaims Okito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\n\n\n\n"

It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know men personally.\nHowever, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind\nand as a person of integrity.\nMy name is PRINCE MABAKA , the son of STEPHEN MABAKA , a farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in\nmy country. As led by my instinct, I deided to contact you through email,after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I\ncan contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.\nThe purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and\npolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabesintroduction of new Land Act Reform.\nwholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers, all white\nfarmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution\nand infact to his political party members and my father though black was\nthe treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition\nparty that did not support the president's idea.\nHe then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down\neverything in the farm. They killed my father and took away a lot of properties from his farm.\nAfter the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over will\ndocuments with instructions from my father that we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him.\nThe will documents has a ertificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit totaling Twelve million\nfive hundred thousand united state dollars. [12.5m] Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown\nto the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as pesonal belongings. This money was\ndeposited with this Private Security Company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for\nthe purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.\nThis violent and barbaic act by Mugabe has since led to the death of my beloved mother and kid sister and\nother innocent lives.\nI was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resisted for a\nwhile, but when the danger bcame unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts,I fled Zimbabwe with the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans\nfrom Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family following this ugly developmnt I have tried to reach him\nbut all to no avail.\nI am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek\nasylum, is because the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I\nhave contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in Johannesburg here, which they have since done.\nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of Netherlands\nprohibits a refugee (aslum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction,\nthis is why I am seeking agenuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be trasferred, hence this proposal\nto you.\nYou have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and brave one, and it entrusts my future\nin your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the depsit from the security\ncompany from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred from Johannesburg, South Africa to\ntheir branch here. The company will be  informed of you representing me.\nFor your assistance, I have two options for you.\nFirstly you can choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for\nthe money to be deposited here, or you can go into patnership with me for the proper profitable\ninvestment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply.\nI have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this\ntransaction, and 4% for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for your moral and financial\nassistance then the balance will be left in the account here for me.\nPlease, I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.Your reply should be sent to my private\nemail address only where upon i shall brief you on the modalities to ensuring\nits realisation.\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I\nthank you in advance as I anticipation\ne your co-operation.\nSincerely,\nPRINCE MABAKA STEPHENS.\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

The decision to write you is out of a sincere desire to establish a business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the international trade and commerce chamber (ITCC) in Madrid.\n\nMy name is Mr. Ali Sesay Karimu, the son of John Karimu (the former\nSecretary of state for finance) who was killed and mutilated by the \nmilitary junta led by Major Paul Koroma after over-throwing the elected \ngovernment of President Tijan Kabba. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it has  consistent features in the CNN, BBC news bulletins. The pressure of war drove the rest of my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for the past 3 years.\n\nSadly, my mother died of cancer 3 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate  for a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reason). The deposit which is worth $32,000.000 (Thirty-two Million U.S. Dollars) was money set apart for government propaganda against the rebel forces. He made the deposit in his name with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have contacted the Security Company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership. The money was however deposited as family treasure.\n\nDue to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit  the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the  money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.\n\nIf you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, \ncontact me immediately through the number/email address indicated above for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal Tel./Fax nos. when replying. \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nAli Sesay Karimu. \n\n\n\n"

The assumption is that your company \nwon the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. \nMore often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated \nfields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for\nexecution. \n\nThis business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost \nconfidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to \nthe successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. \nI have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint \nus.

I had  made series of trips in the past to Lagos Nigeria \n,United Arab Emirates and Europe in the past 2 years to deposit various sums \nof money for my president in security companies.\nInitially, I thought these trunk boxes contained\ndiamond nuggets but I later discovered that indeed\nthey  contained proceeds from the sale of diamonds,\nwhich were gotten during the serrielone crises.\n\nThese trunks I discovered  usually contained $17.5 million dollars in \n100 dollar bills, the funds are  machine packed and defaced. Well on my \ndiscovering of this facts and knowing what fate lay ahead for all\nof us, I deposited one trunk box for myself in the United Arab \nEmirates.Although the office of the security company is also here in \nNigeria,but withdrawals are made in Dubai where they have their vault.\nIt is this trunk box that I now seek your help to make withdrawal and \nkeep so that you can help me invest in your country.\nWe are presently in Nigeria on political assylum as Taylor has handed \nover to his deputy for peace initiatives as demanded by the rebels, and \nthe African Heads Of governments.Our movement are restricted to calabar \ncity.But I am working with my lawyer to get a Nigerian passport so that \nI can leave here as a free person.We had no alternative other than to \nleave Liberia in a haste as even the American Government wants us to \nleave.\nI will come over to your country  to stay with my family since I cannot \ngo back to Liberia inorder not to be jailed or killed by the \nrebels.There is presently an emernse pressure to handover Charles Taylor and his \ncohorts by the international bodies to face trials in Serielone for war \ncrimes. This has triggered my desire to take a risk with this \ntransaction and abarndon them here.View this website for a brief \nwww.hrw.org/africa/liberia.php\nAND www.liberian news.com\n\nI believe we can make this work if you are willing to follow my \ninstructions.Details of the procedure will be givien to you as soon as you \nindicate interest to work with me.  I am willing to give\nyou 20% of the money for your assistance.\nPlease, if this proposal is acceptable to you,\nkindly reply me immediately so that  I can then give\nyou a detailed brief of what we have to do and how\nto do it to achieve success. All the evidence of claims are with me \nnow.But you will work with my lawyer on this project.\nI await your reply soonest as time is of great\nessence.\nBest regards\n\nChristian George.\n\n\n\n"

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance to me.I currently have within my reach the sum of US$35.86M cash which I intend to utilise for investment purposes in your country.The money is part of a  payback from a contract deal between my husband \nand a  Chinese Firm on our country's multi-billion Dollars Railway Line Project.  The Chinese partners returned my husband;s share, US$35.86Million,after his death.  Now the \ncivilian Government in Nigeria has intensified\ntheir probe on myhusband;s financial resources which has led to the closure of all our accounts both locally and internationally, revoking of all our business licences. In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw US$35.86M which was in cash from our Bureau De Change, Foreign Exchange out fit before it was closed down.  I have deposited this money,concealed in eight  trunk boxes as family \ntreasures, in a private security company in Europe with the help of a diplomat who conveyed the trunk boxes containing the funds as a diplomatic luggage to beat security.Five out of the eight trunk boxes contain the money while  three\nboxes contain important documents and other materials.  The security company does not know the actual content of the five boxes, the three boxes were used to cover up for the rest.Due to the current situation in my country and the Government;s attitude to my family, I cannot make use of this money within\nAfrica here, hence, I seek your help in clearing the five boxes so that we can use the money for investment there in your country.  This will also be under your supervision.On your consent please indicate your interest to my attorney\nimmediately for further talks.  Your terms of assistance will also be negotiated when he calls you.  Therefore include your phone numbers.Your urgent response is needed. And I must re\nmind you of the confidentiality of this matter whatever your decision, while I await your response.\n\nRegards\nMrs Marriam Abacha\n \n\n____________________________________________________\n???? .. ???? ?????? ????? .. ? ?? ?? ??????? ??? .. ????  07070101 ?? ??? ???\nhttp://s2.masrawy.com/r.cfm?i=336\n\n?????? .. ????? ???? .. ?? ???\n\n\n\n"

After going through some contracts files and with all application further carefully investigated.I found out  to my greatest surprise that some of them are not the actual Beneficiary of the funds they were about to claim.They were acting in collaboration with some highly placed connected government officials here in Nigeria to claim these money. And I am sure,and in no doubt that this is one of the reason  why the funds has not been transfered into their accounts.\n Really,this fund is still existing in our government annual report payment schedules on foreign debt as unclaimed and in their favour as the sole beneficiary.But it is really unfortunate that their representative here in Nigeria did not complete the transaction because they dont have the experience and so they abandon them.\n\n My main purpose of contacting you is for you to help us to receive this money overseas,All we need from you is for you to stand as a frontier to claim the said fund   we will pouch the money diplomatically to you through a courier company, we have being able to  secure $30 .5 million.Every modalities have been put in place to actualise this fund without any hitch,\nWe have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your account. \n\n1. 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. \n2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer. \n3. 65% to us the originators of the transaction\n\n NOTE: Let honesty,confidentiality and trust be our watchword throughout this deal and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated thank you for your anticipated co-operation while I look forward to a matually benefitting business relation with you.\n Please Reach me on my Email Address above,  Treat as strictly confidential for obvious reasons you know I am still in service. \n\nYours faithfully \n\nMR.DADA KOKA\n\nD .G.\n\n\n\n"

In his position (My father) with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent Kabila, he was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms internationally in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.\nMeanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for the Congolese Army.\nMy father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001.

It will\nbe surprising to you to receive this proposal from me\nsince you do not know me personally.\nHowever, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this\ntransaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a\nperson of integrity.\n\nMy name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,\nof the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered\nin the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,\nI decided to contact you through email, after searching\nfor contacts via the internet, as it is the only means\nI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with\nZimbabwe for security and safety reasons.\n\nHowever, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The\npurpose of this letter is to seek your most needed\nassistance in a business venture. Due to the land and\npolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President\nRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly\naffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black\nfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my\nfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\nBefore he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business\nforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in\nmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit\nthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred\nthousand US dollars), in a private security company. This\nmoney was deposited with this Private Security company for\nsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for the\npurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment\nof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent\nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the\nmurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.\n\nI was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from\nmy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but\nwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder\nattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the\nHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my\ndecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security\ncompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and they\nhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.\n\nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part\nof the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee\n(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved\nin any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a\ngenuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can\nbe transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to\nunderstand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future\nand in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.\n\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is\nto assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the\nsecurity company from their office in Netherlands,\nas it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa\nto their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you\nrepresenting me.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance to me.I currently have within my reach the sum of US$35.86M cash which I intend to utilise for investment purposes in your country.The\nmoney is part of a  payback from a contract deal between my husband and a Chinese Firm on our country's multi-billion Dollars Railway Line Project.  The Chinese partners returned my husband;s share, US$35.86Million,after his death.  \nNow the civilian Government in Nigeria has intensified\ntheir probe on myhusband;s financial resources which has led to the closure of all our accounts both locally and internationally, revoking of all our business licences. In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw US$35.86M which was in cash from our Bureau De Change, Foreign Exchange out fit before it was closed down.  I have deposited this money,concealed in eight  trunk boxes as family treasures, in a private security company in Europe with the help of a diplomat who conveyed the trunk boxes containing the funds as a diplomatic luggage to beat security.Five out of the eight trunk boxes contain the money while three boxes contain important documents and other materials.  The security\ncompany does not know the actual content of the five boxes, the three boxes were used to cover up for the rest.Due to the current situation in my country and the Government;s attitude to my family, I cannot make use of this money within\nAfrica here, hence, I seek your help in clearing the five boxes so that we can use the money for investment there in your country.  This will also be under your supervision.On your consent please indicate your interest to my\nattorney immediately for further talks.  Your terms of assistance will also be negotiated when he calls you.  Therefore include your phone numbers.Your urgent \nresponse is needed.

            "content": "Dear Friend. I am Mr. Phil Ipenza, Provincial Manager Development Bank of Southern Africa(DBSA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a foreign mining consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,5 00,000.00 (Twelve Million,Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declar\n e any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$12,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for processing \n and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my \n share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: pipenza@themail.com </ym/Compose?To=pipenza@themail.com&YY=43534&order=down&sort=date&pos=0&view=a&head=b> Thanks and regards. Mr. Phil Ipenza. \n\n\n\n"

In the course of\ncarrying out our assigned duties, we discovered the sum\nof USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred thousand \ndollars) only lying idle in a suspense account with our\napex bank. This funds emanated from grossly\nover-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of\nforeign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of \nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. On\ncompletion of our assignment, this amount was\ndeliberately not included in our report \nbecause we want to capitalize on this once in a\nlifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out\nof it. The only option we have to achieve our aims and\nobjective is to have this fund transferred to a country\nof our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe\ncustody for us. We are however handicapped at the\nmoment by our status as civil \nservants, which barred us from operating foreign\naccounts while still in government service.\n\nThus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers\nof Commerce, you and your organization were revealed as\nbeing quite astute in private entrepreneurship. On this\npremise, we have no doubt in your ability to handle a\nbusiness of this nature, which informed our desire and\nwish to enter into a partnership with you.

We have mapped out strategies and all\npaperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.\n\nThe nature of your business at present does not really\nmatter because in the world over, bigger firms do bid\nfor big contracts especially in third world countries\nlike ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms\nfor execution. That is you or your firm will be\nregarded as one of those that executed one of such\nprojects and therefore entitled to receive the\nover-invoiced amount of the contract value since the \noriginal contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that\nthis transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually\nno risk is involved either now or in the future for we\nare well connected in official \ncircle. Given our level of commitment at the moment, we\nwant to assure you that with full dedication on your\npart, the objective of having this fund remitted would\nhave been realized within a period of two \nweeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that\nat the end of the transaction, you will be entitled to\n25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for my colleagues\nand I.\n\nIf you are interested in this proposal, please for\nconfidential reasons,you must respond only to my\nprivate email address:ahmansur@phantomemail.com for\nmore clarifications.

            "content": "Dear Friend.\n\nI am Mr. Phil Ipenza, Provincial Manager Development Bank of Southern Africa(DBSA).  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.\nOn June 6, 1999, a foreign mining consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,5 00,000.00 (Twelve Million,Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$12,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for processing and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below.  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  \nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email: pipenza@themail.com\n\n \nThanks and regards.\nMr. Phil Ipenza.\n\n\n\n\napplication/octet-stream attachment: nice13.txt\n\n\n\n\n"

I got your contact through the help of a\nfriend that works with the Chambers of Commerce and\nTourism. Having noted the confidence reposed on your\nperson by the sponsor of the recommendation, I became\nconvinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me\nin receiving the sum of US$25 Million secretly kept in\nvaults with a security companies in my favour by my\nlate husband.\nThis money was kept with a Security Company in Canada\nand Amsterdam, the Netherlands and I have all\ndocuments with me as of when it was deposited with the\nSecurity Vault for safekeeping. This money has been\ndefaced for Security reasons and also to avoid it been\nspent by unauthorized persons. We have been\ndeliberating on how to invest this fund abroad in a\nconfidential manner until we came to a conclusion to\nuse it to buy estates and part of it will be used for\nnon-speculative investments in your country.\n\nHowever, the current civilian administration of\nretired General Olusegun Obasanjo (The President of\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria) is seeking vengeance\non the Abacha family because of the life prison jail\nsentence confirmed on him by my late father while in\noffice. In pursuit of this vendetta, the present\nGovernment have resolved to freeze all known assets of\nGeneral Sani Abacha including properties at home and\nabroad and are presently embarking on to seize the\nvarious bank accounts of my husband in Switzerland, UK\nand Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The\nAbacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our\ntraveling passport, family accounts and even trying\nsome members of our family in court for offences\nallegedly committed by my father.\n\nI was arrested and incarcerated for the past 3years\nand was just release from detention on the agreement\nto refund $1.5 Billion to the Government of my country\nallegedly acquired by my late father. Find out on\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/909972.stm\nWe are not ready to comply with this, as most of our\nfamily assets and bank accounts abroad have been\nfrozen by the Obasanjo regime. In view of this\ngrievous threat to our Economic and personal survival,\nour family trustee have secretly protected the will,\nThe Security Company has called me to do something\nabout claiming this consignment because of the\ndemurrage it is incurring and I told them we would\ncome and claim it very soon but they seriously advised\nme to move the fund into an overseas amount, hence the\nreason why I have chosen you and hope that you will\ncome to my full assistance and unlimited co-operation\nto help me collect the consignment of money and help\nme invest it to prevent my losing the funds.\n\nIn the meantime, there is a traveling embargo on the\nfamily members and our local accounts are seized. We\nare currently living on goodwill of people who believe\nwe cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband. In view of\nthis plight, I expect you to be\ntrustworthy and kind enough to respond to this\ndistressed call to save our family from a hopeless\nfuture. And if you agree to help, we will compensate\nyou sincerely for your candid effort in this regard\nwith 15% of the total amount of $25 Million US\nDollars. In that case, when the consignment of money\n(US$25 Million), you will be allowed to withdraw 15%\nin your favor, while 10% has been set aside for any\nexpenses you might incur (There are demurrage to pay\nbefore the fund is sign and claimed by you,but that is\nour business,all expenses will be taken care of by\nus,through an investor during the process of securing\nthis fund. The remaining 65% will be invested\nmeaningfully for our family future.\nI look forward to your quick response while thanking\nyou for your co-operation.

Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha,I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration headed by General Olusegun Obasanjo who was his arch enemy(he was thrown into prison by my husband on treason charges),I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. \n\nAs a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence in anybody within the country. \n\nYou must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad,some companies willingly gave up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there and many outrightly blackmailed us. \n\nIn fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700.Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. \n\nI repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy(house arrest) so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$75 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. \n\nI shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping.This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as I regain my freedom so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. I am still under house arrest being monitored by the security agents day-in day-out.\n\nAnd should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to help me out through my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things. \n\nIn case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence. I will greatly \nappreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith. \nPlease expedite action. \n\nAlternative email box: (mary2003@hknetmail.com).\n\nSincerely Yours \n\nMrs. Maryam Abacha.\n\n\n\n"

The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. \n\nI took this decision because I dont have any child that will  inherit this \nmoney and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my \nhusbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a \nsituation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the \nreason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know \nwhere I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. \nExodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.   As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Pinnacle Finance/Security Company  in spain . I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund. \n\nI want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my \nshephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this   same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I  stated herein.

I am BARRISTER PETER AYO,the legal adviser to late Mr.\nand Mrs. Bright Williams,a British couple that lived in my Country Nigeria\nfor 25 years before they both died in a plane crash late last year.

Throughout their stay in my country, they cquired a lot of properties\nlike lands, house properties, etc.\n\nAs their legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Bright Williams\ninstructed me to write his WILL. Because they had no child, they dedicated\ntheir wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold\nand the money be given out to a ministry for the work of God. As their legal\nadviser,\nall the documents for the properties were in my care. He gave me the authority\nto sell the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work\nofGod.\n\nTo cut the story short, I sold all the properties after their death, as\ninstructed by my client,Mr. Bright Williams before his death.

After hearing the word of\nGod, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born\nagain Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened\nmy eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 nd 19. From the scripture, I discovered that the\nonly way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right\nby giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by my client.\nI have asked God for forgiveness on my initial thought  oncerning the money,and\nI know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right\nin the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen inistry for the\npurpose of God's work as instructed by my client before his death. After\nmy fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to\na honest Christian or the chosen ministry that deserves this fund by his\nGrace.\nI then came across your address on the Internet as I was rowsing through\na Christian site, and as a matter of fact, it is not nly you or your ministry\nthat I picked on the Christian site nitially, but after my fervent prayer\nover it, then you were nominated  through divine revelation from God, so\nthat was  how I\nreceived such a divine revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact\ninformation, and I then decided to contact you for the fund to be used wisely\nfor things that will glorify the name of God.\n\nI have notified the Security Company where I deposited the consignments\nthat contained the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad and the\nsecurity company has since been waiting for my authority for the consignment\nto leave my country and be moved abroad.

It has defiled all forms of\nmedicine, and right now I have only about a few\nmonths to live, according to medical experts.\n\n\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\nnever really cared for anyone not even myself but my\nbusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never\ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only\nfocus on my business as that was the only thing I\ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know\nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have\nor make all the money in the world. I believe when God\ngives me a second chance to come to this world I would\nlive my life a different way from how I have lived it.\n\n\n\nNow that God ! has called me, I have willed and given\nmost of my properties and assets to my immediate and\nextended family members and as well as a few close\nfriends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my\nsoul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity\norganizations and give succour and confort to the less\npriviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one\nof the last good deeds I do on earth. \n\n\nSo far, I have distributed money to some charity\norganizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now\nthat my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do\nthis my self anymore. I once asked members of my\nfamily to close one of my accounts and distribute the\nmoney which I have there to charity organization and\nto the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they\nrefused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do\nnot trust them anymore, as they seem not to be\ncontended with what I have left for them. \n\n\nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge\ncash deposit of twenty four million dollars that I\nhave with a Security Company in Europe for safe\nkeeping. I will want you to help me collect this\ndeposit and disburse it to some charity organizations\nand to the less priviledged.\n\n\nPlease send me a mail to indicate if you will assist\nme in this disbursement.\n\n\nI have set aside 10% for you for your time and\npatience.\n\n\nYou can e-mail me at:petlawson@gawab.com\n \n\nWhile I await to hear from you, may God be with you\nand your entire family.\n\nRemain blessed.\n\nPeter Lawson\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\n\n\n\n"

Secondly,\nI am using this means so that my personality can be\nsheilded until I am sure of your willingness to assist\nme in achieving the purposes of this business which\nwill be of a high benefit to you and to my family. \n\nI am Lieutenant Colonel Salem O. Ahmad Military Commander\nof POLISARIO(Political Front for the Liberation of\nWestern Sahara) and a member of council of the\nNational Secretariat of Western Sahara(Saharawi\nDemocratic Republic). Prior to my promotion to this\nrank/command, I was the second in command to the\nformer military Commander General Sahid Adbelahib. He\nwas however killed in battle in early January. \n\nTHE PURPOSE OF CONTACTING YOU: \nThe struggle for the liberation of the Saharawi people\nfrom the strong grip of Morocco and it's despotic\ngovernment, haszaenjoyed funding from private,\nreligious and corporate organizations around the\nworld, people and organizations recognizes our\nstruggle. These organizations are the ones who\nassist/aid POLISARIO with funds and materials in\nexecution of this war with Morocco. Before the death\nof my former Military commander(General Adbelahib), we\nwere given some funds(US$38,000,000.00) by an\ninternational solid mineral multi-national company\ndonor to procure ammunitions for POLISARIO. My boss\nmoved and deposited these funds with a private\nsecurity/finance company in Europe. In my bid to audit\nour quarterly accounts I realized that the records of\nthe $38Million was not reflected in the books. As I\ncontinued my private investigation I unclosed the\nsource of these funds. I found out that it was my boss\nwho delete every record of this larges from the\naccounting books because his intentions is to keep\nthis particular funds for himself. I called him to a\nmeeting(two of us) over this issue - that was in March\nlast year. He told me at the meeting that the funds as\npart of the donations POLISARIO(Political Front for\nthe Liberation of Western Sahara) get year in and year\nout is to be kept for his use and the future of his\nfamily since the future of the survival of the\nstruggle is uncertain. I saw his reasons and readily\nagreed with him because he promised me a good fraction\nof the money there and then, especially when I know\nthat the money will never have a record trace ever.\nHowever, as fate may have it General Adbelahib died at\nthe wafront and I became the military commander in\nFeburary 2nd. And in addition to that the only only\nperson on earth who has previlege of knowing the\ninformation of this cash deposit. I have all the\nrelevant documents pertaining to this deposit. I now\nwant to claim this funds knowing fully well that I\nhave all the relating documents needed to claim these\nfunds. These documents are the Certificate of Deposit\nwith which the Cash was deposited, and also the\nDeposit Agreement.

I will provide all the necessary\ndocuments in my disposal to lay to claim these funds -\nwhich as the requirement agreed-up with the\nsecurity/finance company. The issue is this: I will\ntransfer legal ownership of these funds to you so that\nyou can then be the new beneficiary of the funds that\nway my link with the funds terminated for a smooth\nmovement of the funds to you. \nThere are no risks involved in this business because I\nremain here and hold all machineries involved in this\nbusiness.

As you may be aware, \nwe had been under intense pressure\nfrom rebels who have not relented in the quest to\nunseat Mr. Taylor from power.He is presently in Nigeria on assylum \ngranted to him and his cohorts by the good people of Nigeria.\n\nAs the special assistant to the President on special\nduties. I had  made series of trips in the past to Lagos Nigeria \n,United Arab Emirates and Europe in the past 2 years to deposit various sums \nof money for my president in security companies.\nInitially, I thought these trunk boxes contained\ndiamond nuggets but I later discovered that indeed\nthey  contained proceeds from the sale of diamonds,\nwhich were gotten during the serrielone crises.\n\nThese trunks I discovered  usually contained $17.5 million dollars in \n100 dollar bills, the funds are  machine packed and defaced. Well on my \ndiscovering of this facts and knowing what fate lay ahead for all\nof us, I deposited one trunk box for myself in the United Arab \nEmirates.Although the office of the security company is also here in \nNigeria,but withdrawals are made in Dubai where they have their vault.\nIt is this trunk box that I now seek your help to make withdrawal and \nkeep so that you can help me invest in your country.\nWe are presently in Nigeria on political assylum as Taylor has handed \nover to his deputy for peace initiatives as demanded by the rebels, and \nthe African Heads Of governments.Our movement are restricted to calabar \ncity.But I am working with my lawyer to get a Nigerian passport so that \nI can leave here as a free person.We had no alternative other than to \nleave Liberia in a haste as even the American Government wants us to \nleave.\nI will come over to your country  to stay with my family since I cannot \ngo back to Liberia inorder not to be jailed or killed by the \nrebels.There is presently an emernse pressure to handover Charles Taylor and his \ncohorts by the international bodies to face trials in Serielone for war \ncrimes. This has triggered my desire to take a risk with this \ntransaction and abarndon them here.View this website for a brief \nwww.hrw.org/africa/liberia.php\nAND www.liberian news.com\n\nI believe we can make this work if you are willing to follow my \ninstructions.Details of the procedure will be givien to you as soon as you \nindicate interest to work with me.  I am willing to give\nyou 20% of the money for your assistance.\nPlease, if this proposal is acceptable to you,\nkindly reply me immediately so that  I can then give\nyou a detailed brief of what we have to do and how\nto do it to achieve success. All the evidence of claims are with me \nnow.But you will work with my lawyer on this project.\nI await your reply soonest as time is of great\nessence.\nBest regards\n\nChristian George.\n\n\n\n"

Secondly,\nI am using this means so that my personality can be\nsheilded until I am sure of your willingness to assist\nme in achieving the purposes of this business which\nwill be of a high benefit to you and to my family. \n\nI am Lieutenant Colonel Salem O. Ahmad Military Commander\nof POLISARIO(Political Front for the Liberation of\nWestern Sahara) and a member of council of the\nNational Secretariat of Western Sahara(Saharawi\nDemocratic Republic). Prior to my promotion to this\nrank/command, I was the second in command to the\nformer military Commander General Sahid Adbelahib. He\nwas however killed in battle in early January. \n\nTHE PURPOSE OF CONTACTING YOU: \nThe struggle for the liberation of the Saharawi people\nfrom the strong grip of Morocco and it's despotic\ngovernment, haszaenjoyed funding from private,\nreligious and corporate organizations around the\nworld, people and organizations recognizes our\nstruggle. These organizations are the ones who\nassist/aid POLISARIO with funds and materials in\nexecution of this war with Morocco. Before the death\nof my former Military commander(General Adbelahib), we\nwere given some funds(US$38,000,000.00) by an\ninternational solid mineral multi-national company\ndonor to procure ammunitions for POLISARIO. My boss\nmoved and deposited these funds with a private\nsecurity/finance company in Europe. In my bid to audit\nour quarterly accounts I realized that the records of\nthe $38Million was not reflected in the books. As I\ncontinued my private investigation I unclosed the\nsource of these funds. I found out that it was my boss\nwho delete every record of this larges from the\naccounting books because his intentions is to keep\nthis particular funds for himself. I called him to a\nmeeting(two of us) over this issue - that was in March\nlast year. He told me at the meeting that the funds as\npart of the donations POLISARIO(Political Front for\nthe Liberation of Western Sahara) get year in and year\nout is to be kept for his use and the future of his\nfamily since the future of the survival of the\nstruggle is uncertain. I saw his reasons and readily\nagreed with him because he promised me a good fraction\nof the money there and then, especially when I know\nthat the money will never have a record trace ever.\nHowever, as fate may have it General Adbelahib died at\nthe wafront and I became the military commander in\nFeburary 2nd. And in addition to that the only only\nperson on earth who has previlege of knowing the\ninformation of this cash deposit. I have all the\nrelevant documents pertaining to this deposit. I now\nwant to claim this funds knowing fully well that I\nhave all the relating documents needed to claim these\nfunds. These documents are the Certificate of Deposit\nwith which the Cash was deposited, and also the\nDeposit Agreement. I therefore want you to\nteam/partner with me to collect the funds in Europe as\nI require a foreigner to perfect this operation. Let\nme know your terms. I will provide all the necessary\ndocuments in my disposal to lay to claim these funds -\nwhich as the requirement agreed-up with the\nsecurity/finance company. The issue is this: I will\ntransfer legal ownership of these funds to you so that\nyou can then be the new beneficiary of the funds that\nway my link with the funds terminated for a smooth\nmovement of the funds to you. \nThere are no risks involved in this business because I\nremain here and hold all machineries involved in this\nbusiness. I should also clearly state here that as\nlong as you keep this business confidential there is\nno means whereby risk can be imported to it. This is\nbecause someone elses knowledge remain the only thing\nthat can import any risk to this deal. This is a\nsimple and straight forward business, but must be kept\nhighly confidential so that we can record success in\nit within the next 10 working days. Upon the receipt\nof a positive response from you, I will give you\nfurther details; outlining the method of operation\nwhich has been mastered to pull this transaction\nthrough soonest. \nTherefore, if you are interested, please do reach me\nvia e-mail(Colsalemoahmad@maktoob.com), while I perfect\na better communication means for this project.

It will\nbe surprising to you to receive this proposal from me\nsince you do not know me personally.\nHowever, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this\ntransaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a\nperson of integrity.\n\nMy name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,\nof the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered\nin the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,\nI decided to contact you through email, after searching\nfor contacts via the internet, as it is the only means\nI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with\nZimbabwe for security and safety reasons.\n\nHowever, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The\npurpose of this letter is to seek your most needed\nassistance in a business venture. Due to the land and\npolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President\nRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly\naffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black\nfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my\nfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.\n\n\n\nBefore he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business\nforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in\nmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit\nthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred\nthousand US dollars), in a private security company. This\nmoney was deposited with this Private Security company for\nsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for the\npurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment\nof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent\nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the\nmurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.\n\nI was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from\nmy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but\nwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder\nattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the\nHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my\ndecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security\ncompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and they\nhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.\n\nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part\nof the money.

            "content": "ATTN:  \n\nMy name is MR .MUSA USENI the eldest son of Rtd\nGeneral JEREMAIAH.J. T. USENI who was the estwhile\nMinister of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in the\nlate General Sani Abacha?s Regime of 1993-1998.\nI am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost\nconfidence and trust to enable us provide a solution\nto a money transfer of $60M that is presently putting\nmy entire family into great disarray.  You may be\nquite surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not\ndespair, I got your contact from a business site on\nthe internet and following the information I gathered\nabout you, I was convinced that you could be of\nassistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once\ndue to the urgency required for us to immediately\ntransfer the said funds out of the country.\nDuring the time my father was in the government with\nthe late General Sani Abacha as the head of state,\nthey were both involved in several deals that yielded\nBillions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals\nwas monies that emanated from funds set aside for the\nimportation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the\nNigerian Defense, funds set to embark on an oversea\ncampaign to counter the United States action to put a\nstop to the self succession bid of the Abacha?s\ngovernment to retain power, and monies set aside to\nrehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries\nand the National Electric Power Authority which\nsupplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are\nconversant with world news, you would understand\nbetter.\n\nDuring this period my father was able to make some\ngood money for himself and kept in his private bank\naccounts. The then head of state General Sani Abacha\ntransferred his share of the money through a Lebanese\nbusinessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark\nRissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all\nthe secrets were revealed by the investigation\nagencies set up by the successive governments and most\nof the Abacha?s loots were traced and repatriated from\nthe various accounts to the Federal\nGovernmentTreasury.\nOut of the money my father made, he left the sum of\nN50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow\naccount for further transfer into a foreign account\nand a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in\na Private security firm here in Nigeria. Through the\nconfessions made by the Abacha?s Family, the N50\nMillion was recovered by the investigating agency from\nthe CBN escrow account.  But were unable to discover\nthe $60M, which he kept in the vaults. The reason is\nbecause no names were used to lodge in the funds.\nInstead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (PIN)\nand declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury\nBills. Also the firm issued him with a certificate of\ndeposit of the consignments. Note that I have these\ninformation in my custody.\n\nRight now, my father has been arrested and detained\nfor interrogation. As the eldest son of my Father, I\nbelieve that I owe the entire family an obligation to\nensure that the $60M is successfully transferred\nabroad for investment purposes.  With the present\nsituation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based\non this that I am making this contact with you. I have\ndone a thorough homework and fine-tuned the best way\nto create you as the beneficiary to the funds and\neffect the transfer accordingly.  Is rest assured that\nthe modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire\nproject guarantees our safety and the successful\ntransfer of the funds.  So, you will be absolutely\nright when you say that this project is risk free and\nviable. If you are capable and willing to assist,\ncontact me at once via email for more details.\n\nBelieve me, there is no one else we can trust again.\nAll my fathers? friends have deserted us after\nexploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my\nfather. As it is said, ?it is at the time of problems\nthat you know your true friends?.  So long as you keep\neverything to yourself, we would definitely have no\nproblems. For your assistance, I am ready to give you\nas much as 20% of the total funds after transfer and\ninvest a reasonable percentage into any viable\nbusiness you may suggest.\n\nPlease, I need your assistance to make this happen and\nplease do not undermine it because it will also be a\nsource of up liftment to you also.  You have\nabsolutely nothing to loose in assisting us instead,\nyou have so much to gain.\n\nAwaiting your urgent and positive response.\n\nBEST REGARDS,\n\nMr MUSA USENI.:234-80345-44689\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n"

I am contacting Yo\n\nu presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us. \nI have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been \ndeclared \"UNCLAIMED\" by the chairman and some members of the board of \ndirectors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. CHAW, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria. \nEngr. CHAW an American citizen was a contractor with the \nFederal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has bee\n\nn tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. CHAW has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the bo\n\nard of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably \nis an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military \nequipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa. \nThis of course, is senseless, hence my mission. \nMy colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating \npersons that could be remotely related to Engr. CHAW and we have been doing this \nfor about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard.\n\n\n\nWe have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We w\n\nill also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your par\n\nticipation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I. \n\nI make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of thi\n\ns email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way. \n\nThank you and best regards. \n\nMr. JOHNSON ELENDU \nREPLY THROUGH THIS E-MAIL ONLY: [jelendu@eudoramail.com] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\n\n\n\n"

As led by my instict,\nI decided to contact you through email, after searching\nfor contacts via the internet, as it is the only means\nI can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with\nZimbabwe for security and safety reasons.\nHowever, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The\npurpose of this letter is to seek your most needed\nassistance in a business venture. Due to the land and\npolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President\nRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly\naffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black\nfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my\nfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.\nBefore he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business\nforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in\nmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit\nthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred\nthousand US dollars), in a private security company. This\nmoney was deposited with this Private Security company for\nsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for the\npurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment\nof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent\nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the\nmurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.\nI was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from\nmy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but\nwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder\nattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the\nHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my\ndecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security\ncompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and they\nhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.\nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part\nof the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee\n(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved\nin any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a\ngenuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can\nbe transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to\nunderstand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future\nand in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.\nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is\nto assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the\nsecurity company from their office in Netherlands,\nas it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa\nto their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you\nrepresenting me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.\nFirstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your\nassistance, and helping me open an account for the money\nto be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with\nme for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.\nWhichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I\nhave also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of\nexpenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%\n($580,000,00) for Charity donation.\nIf you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an\naccount,\nthen 85%will be left in the account here for me.

In his position (My father) with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent Kabila, he was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms internationally in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.\nMeanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for the Congolese Army.\nMy father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001.

My mother and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.\nI got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in Belgium. Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the total sum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me and my family.

First, I \nmust solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by \nvirtue of its nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have \nconfidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of \nthis great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the \nsaid amount into your safe account for onward investment. You can either \nprovide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account \nimmediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve, as long as \nyou will remain honest to me till the end of this important business \ntrusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or \nin future.\n\nI am the Auditor general and the personal account officer to a great late \nINDUSTRIALIST who has an account in one of the prime banks here in South \nAfrica. The account was opened in 1996 and he died in 1998 without a written \nor oral WILL and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again  hence \nthe money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will \nbe forfeited for nothing since the bank has been sold on Wed, 19 Mar 2003   \nto another bank and the management of the bank is now ready to release the \nfund to any foreigner who has the correct information of the account before \nfully handing over the management to the new bank.\n\nThe owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about \nthis account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary \nand until his death, he was the manager of the company. My investigation \nthrough the National immigration department proved to me as well that he was \nsingle as at the point of his entry into the Republic of South Africa.\n\nWe will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000]. Upon \nsuccessful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall \nre-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of 20 million to your \naccount.\nThe total amount involved is Twenty six million United States Dollars only \n[$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million United \nStates Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before \nthe rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a \nforeigner\nbecause this money can not be approved to a local person here, but can only \nbe approved to any foreigner  who has the correct information of the account \nwhich I will provide to you.\n\nOn confirmation of your willingness to receive this fund in your account, I \nwill involve my confidant lawyer who is a government accredited attorney to \nthe bank to represent you in various offices here to secure all the relevant \ndocuments in your name required to make the transfer a success. I therefore \nassure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both \nparties.\n\nHowever, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together when we meet \nface to face after the first transfer of $6 Million before transferring the \nsecond part of $20 Million. I am revealing this to you with believe that you \nwill never let me down in this business. You are the first and the only \nperson that\nI am contacting for this business; so please reply urgently so that I will \ninform you the next step to take urgently.\n\nSend me full details of the account to be used for this transfer, including \nyour direct telephone and fax numbers so that we can have a heart to heart \ndiscussion. I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a \nbinding agreement that will bind us together immediately after the first \ntransfer before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and \ninvestments.\n\nI need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management \nis ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct \ninformation of this account, which I will give to you upon your positive \nresponse and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with \ninstruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this \nbusiness. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me \ndown.\nWith my position and influence in the bank, the money can be transferred to \nany foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with assurance that \nthis money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for \nsharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction \nimmediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build \nconfidence.\n\nYou can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite \nphone, which I secured for the security and safety of this business, as you \nknow that this business is confidential\n\nAt the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total \namount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might \nhave incurred during the process of transferring.\nI look forward to your earliest reply through my email address/fax or \ntelephone.\n\nRegards,\nMr. Maxwell Bukas\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nUnsatisfied with being single?

            "content": "From: Mrs Serena Jones\n  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.\n       I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year\n2000.\n We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only\nfour days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three \nmonths due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.\nI took this decision because I don?t have any child that will  inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My \nhappiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch or christian individual for this  same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I  stated herein.  Hoping to hearing from you. \nN.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, THE LAWYER'S NUMBER IS 00-31-620-668-086.\nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\nYours in Christ,\nMrs Serena Jones  \n\n\n\n"

I am Mr. Michael Makeh, with Banque Financier De L'Afrique with regional office in Lome-Togo. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Hussein Hanadi ), who deposited the sum of US$7.8 million (Seven Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in the atlantic ocean, U.S.A. Confirmable from the website; ( www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html ). But, since that year after the death of our client, we have not had anybody that comes for the claims of this money as the next of kin to our client. A situation I have monitored closely with my position in our bank. \n\nNow, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before and after his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past years now, I have removed the file to my \"private vault\". I now humbly solicit for your assistance in this issue. I wish to present you as the next of kin to this our client so as to claim out this money, before it is remmited into the fedral account where other people may aswell claim it directly without going to this lenght. I have taken every necessary precautionary measures concerning this issue and arrangement has been concluded by me in achieving this goal, provided you will follow my instructions in the process. I am only waiting for your response to enable me move the funds to your agreed safe account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed also provided you give me your assistance and support.\n\nI therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal.

This funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we have\nto achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to acountry.\n\nThus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce, you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire and wish to enter into a partnership with you. This business involves the remittance of this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the balance\nwill be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.\n\n The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those thatexecuted one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well\nConnected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment, we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for my colleague and myself.\n\n If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an e-mail VIA: mutualbiz@post.cz for more clarifications. If however you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this business with.\n\n I anticipate a timely response from you.\nYours Sincerely,\n\n\n\nCHURCHILL WILLIAMS\n\n\n\n\n"

This funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms by the\nPetroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was deliberately not included in our\nreport because we want to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to acountry.\n\nThus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce, you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to handle a\nbusiness of this nature, which informed our desire and wish to enter into a partnership with you. This business involves the remittance of this amount into\nyour bank account with the hope of travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in\nyour country based on your advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have mapped out strategies and\nall paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.\n\n The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world\ncountries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those thatexecuted one of\nsuch projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that\nthis transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment, we\nwant to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of two weeks.\nIt is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for my colleague and\nmyself.\n\n If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an e-mail VIA: mutualbiz@post.cz for more clarifications. If however you are not interested,\nstill let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this business with.\n\n I anticipate a timely response from you. \n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n\n\nDR. CHURCHILL WILLIAMS\n\n\n\ntext/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n"

This money came as a payback contract deal\nbetween my late husband and Russian firm on our countrys Multi-Billion\nDollar Ajaokuta Steel Plant.\n\nThe Russian partner returned my husbands share of US$30,000,000.00 USD\nafter the death of my husband and lodged it with a finance company in\nEurope of which I am the Beneficiary. Right now the new civilian\ngovernment have intensified their probe on my husbands financial\nresources and they revoked our licenses that allows us to own a financial\nand Oil Company. I have since declared myself and my family Bankruptcy.\nNo record ever existed concerning the money neither the money tranceable\nby the  Government because there is no documentation showing that we\nreceived the money from the Russians. Due to the current situation in\nthe  country and government attitude towards my family, it has become\nquite impossible for me to make use of this money within, and outside\nespecially in Europe as the European government has been assisting our\ngovernment in the tracing of any of our bank accounts oversea, hence my\nmovement is restricted by the government now.\n\nThus I seek assistance to transfer this money out of this account to a non\ntraceable and safe account designation through our family representative\nBARRISTER ALI KALOMA, (SAN) To enable us discuss in details about\nthis transaction please contact him on e-mail as indicated above.\n\nWHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO\n\nI will transfer the ownership of the money and issue you a power of attorney\nthrough my Lawyer. With these document you will present to the bank for\nclaiming the money as my proxy from the finance company in Europe.\nThe entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer\nthat knows the details of the money.\n\nAfter you must have transfer the money to your country where it is save my\nLawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money\nfor investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to\ntransfer this fund, I propose a commission of 30% (Thirty Persent) of the\ntotal sum to you for the expected services and assistance.Your urgent\nresponse is highly needed so as to stop futher contact. All\ncorrespondence must be by e-mail I must use this opportunity to implore\nyou to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily\nconfidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt\nresponse.\n\nRegards,\nDR.

In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we \ndiscovered the sum of USD40.5M (forty million, five hundred thousand \ndollars) only lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to  conglomerate of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our \nassignment, this amount was deliberately not included in our report \nbecause we want to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we have to  achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to a country of our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe custody \nfor us. We are however handicapped at the moment by our status as civil servants, which barred us from operating foreign accounts while still in government service.\n\nThus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce, \nyou and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in \nprivate entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your \nability to handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire \nand wish to enter into a partnership with you. This business involves \nthe remittance of this amount into your bank account with the hope of \ntravelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. \nWe hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on \nyour advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign \nearnings. \n\nWe have mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place \nto ensure a 100% success.The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment, we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of two weeks. \n\nIt is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for my colleagues and I.If you are interested in this proposal, please for confidential reasons respond to my private email address:ahmansur@tiscali.co.uk or to my tel/fax number as specified above for more clarifications. If however you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this business with.\n\nI anticipate a timely response from you.\n\nThanks.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n\nDR.AHMED MANSUR.\n \n\n\n\n\n"

Last year my brother, the king chose an eigth wife the  age of 17 but due to pressure from our citizens and government the wedding  did not take place and instead my brother had to pay a fine of a cow to appease his people. This was very humiliaiting to our family as the Royal Family still rules in our country. \n\nThis situation represents the threat that has come to the exsistence of the Royal Family of Swaziland. Due to this problem we came to the realisation  that our family heritage has to remain in the hands of its rightful owners. My brother has now given me the sum of USD $15,500,000 MILLION to invest abroad in the intrest of him. \n\nI am currently residing in Madrid,Spain and I on behalf of my brother am looking for a reliable person to help me invest this fortune. Unfortunatly I do not have any friends and it is the first time I have travelled outside my country I would be grateful for your assistence, if you decide to assiste me in this matter I will give 15% of the total amount mentioned above. \n\nIf you are intrested in this issue please notify me on the following e-mail: dianedlamini@netscape.net with your contact telephone number so that I can explain better. \n\nYours Sincerely \n\nH.R.H.\n\nDiane Sibusiso Dlamini\n\n\n\n"

I am the first Son of the most popular black farmer \nin Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got \nyour contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before \nthe death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of \nUS$15 Million (fifteen million United States dollars), in one of the  \nsecurity company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This \nmoney was deposited in a Trunk box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage \nfrom the Security Company.\n\nThis amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals \nfor the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land \nproblem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new \nLand Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few \nblack farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by \nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of \npeople were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was \none of the victims. it is against this background that I and my family \nfled Zimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.\nAfter which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying \nin the Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have \ndecided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign \naccount. Since the law of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open \nany bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction \nthroughout the territorial zone of European Union. As the eldest child of my \nfather, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine \nforeign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge \nof my government who are bent on taking everything we have got.\n\nThe South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am \nfaced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family \nname for fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries \nhave similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to \nentrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you \nknow that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my \nfamily, all I want you to do for me, is to make arrangements with the \nsecurity company to clear the Consignment (funds) from their affiliate \noffice here in the Netherlands as i have already given directives for \nthe consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.\nBut before then all modalities will have to be put in place like, \nchange of ownership of the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly \nyou can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating \nyour account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with \nme for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. \nWhichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. \nIf you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the \nmoney while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in any of the \ncountry of your choice. Contact with my email- ( osumauchi@netscape.net\n) while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this \ntransaction.\nI await your immediate reply and God bless.\n\nBest regards,\nOSOMA ZUMA.\n\nNOTE:\nON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM \nME SO I CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n"

I am Mr Lutherking taylor Jr, a cousin to the former president Charles Taylor of Liberia . As a result of the increasing rebel hostility in my country and the recent indictment of Charles Taylor by the international war crimes tribunal, he has mandated me to look for a reliable partner who will urgently assist in the collection of consignment of boxes containing cash of (US$22.5M) he kept in safe custody with a security management company in Spain and it is registered as farmily valiables.\n\n\nWe need a foreigner whom we will portray as the bona-fide owner of the consignment to prevent the company from finding out the consignment belongs to the former president Taylor and thereby confiscating such because of the current military fiasco in my country.

However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty and high caliber.Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name is Yourme Taylor,i am the son to President Charles Taylor, the President of Republic of Liberia. I got your email address from network directory. I apologize if I have infringed on your privacy.\n\nIt may interest you to know that my Father (former President Charles Taylor)has been fighting serious civil war with the Liberia United for the Restoration of Democracy (LURDS) for quite some years now. The LURDS has been backed (all along) by some foreign powerful countries.Not quite long ago, the American government ordered My Father to leave Liberia or be forced out of power. Knowing fully well the capabilities of America and other powerful members of the United Nations,my Father(President Charles Taylor) decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country Nigeria to seek asylum. He is presently in a town called calabar is Nigeria.A new government headed by Vice President Mr Moses Blah has been sworn in.\n\nBased on these developments, the various foreign bank accounts of my Father are already being investigated. News just came in that one of the fattest accounts he has in Switzerland has been frozen. In the light of all these sad happenings, my Father, through the help of his loyalists has secretly moved a sum of US$30m(THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS]to a private security company vault in europe and right now,my Father wants the services of a highly reliable foreigner that will receive the funds into his/her  bank account for the future survival of my family because he cannot presently operate any foreign bank account on his name.\n\nThese funds (US$30m) arose from various compensation he received from the sales of rubber, timber and diamonds which are abound in great quantity around the coastal areas of the country.My father and I have decided that if you are able assist us,you shall be compensated with 20% commission of the funds, 5% of this money shall be set aside to take care of any local or foreign expenses that might be incurred along the line. My family will make do with the remaining 70% of the funds. It might also interest you to note that all security arrangements regarding this transaction has been put in place, therefore,you have nothing whatsoever to fear or worry about.\n\nMost part of this share (80%) for my family will also be invested in your country courtesy of your full advice and assistance because that is the most importat part of this transaction.\n\nAs you indicate interest to assist my family,I will be expecting to receive your kind and urgent response through this more confidential email address\n(yourmetaylor@yahoo.com) for us to proceed to more details on this pending transaction.\n\nGod bless you as you respond promptly.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYourme Taylor.\n\n\n\n"

Grace and peace and love\nfrom this part of the Atlantic to you.I hope my\nletter does not cause you too much embarrassment as I\nwrite to you in good faith based on the contact\naddress  i got during a browse on the internet for a \ntrustworthy foreing partner who will assist us lay claims \nas beneficiary to the sum of  $75m.\nPlease excuse my intrusion into your private life.\n\n\nI am Barrister Nickson Dako, i represent Mohammed\nAbacha, son of the late gen. Sani Abacha, who was the\nformer military head of state in Nigeria, he died in\n1998. Since his death, the family has been losing a\nlot of money due to vindictive government officials\nwho are bent on dealing with the family, based on this\ntherefore, the family has asked me to seek for a\nforeign partner who can work with us as to move out\nthe total sum of US$75,000,000.00 ( seventy five\nmillion united states dollars ), presently in their\npossession.This money was of course, acquired by the\nlate president and is now kept secretly by the family.\nThe Swiss government has already frozen all the\naccounts of the family in Switzerland, and some other\ncountries would soon follow to do the same. This bid\nby some government officials to deal with this family\nhas made it necessary that we seek your assistance in\nreceiving this money and  investing it on behalf\nof the family.\n\nThis must be a joint venture transaction and we must\nall work together. since this money is still cash,\nextra security measures have been taken to protect it\nfrom theft or seizure, pending when agreement  is\nreached on when and how to move it into any of your\nnominated bank accounts. I have personally worked out\nall modalities for the peaceful conclusion of this\ntransaction.The transaction definitely would be\nhandled in phases and the first phase will involve the\nmoving of US$25,000,000.00( twenty five million\nunited states dollars ).\n\nMy client is willing to give you a reasonable\npercentage of this money as soon as the transaction is\nconcluded. I will, however, based on the fact that\nyou are willing to work with us and also all\ncontentious issues discussed before the commencement\nof this transaction. You may also discuss your\npercentage before we start to work .As soon as I hear\nfrom you, I will give you all necessary details as to\nhow we intend to carry out the whole transaction.\nPlease, do not entertain any fear, as all necessary\nmodalities are in place, and I assure you of maximum\nsuccess and secrecy in this transaction.\n\nPlease, this transaction requires absolute\nconfidentiality and you would be expected to treat it\nas such until the funds are successfully moved out of this country.\n\nPlease, you will also ignore this letter and respect\nour trust in you by not exposing this transaction,\neven if you are not interested.I look forward to\nworking with you. \n\nBest regards,\n\nBarrister Nickson Dako \"Esq\"\n\nN,B,\n    Please, endeavour to make your correspondence\nto my confidential e-mail address below,\n\nnkdakoconsult@libero.it\n\n\n\n"

B.N}\n\nDear Sir\n\n\nFirst, i must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. however after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and reports from the world Bank and the International Monetry Fund (I.M.F)as  the inability of the Central Bank of Nigeria to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors, Our Head of State (the president) in conjuntion with the council of ministers,has mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately,so as to sanitize the image of our great country caused by the embarrasment. \nIn view of the above,the country has found it very necessary to review some contract files and application submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment. After going through some contracts files and with all application further carefully investigated.I found out  to my greatest surprise that some of them are not the actual Beneficiary of the funds they were about to claim.They were acting in collaboration with some highly placed connected government officials here in Nigeria to claim these money. And I am sure,and in no doubt that this is one of the reason  why the funds has not been transfered into their accounts. Really,this fund is still existing in our government annual report payment schedules on foreign debt as unclaimed and in their favour as the sole beneficiary.But it is really unfortunate that their representative here in Nigeria did not complete the transaction because they dont have the experience and so they abandon them.we have being a\n ble to secure $30 .5 million.Every modalities have been put in place to actualise this fund without any hitch,after it has been transferred into your account. \nMy main purpose of contacting you is for you to help us to receive this money overseas,All we need from you is for you to stand as a frontier to claim the said fund   we will pouch the money diplomatically to you through a courier company,\n\n1. 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. \n2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer. \n3. 65% to us the originators of the transaction \n\n\n NOTE: Let honesty,confidentiality and trust be our watchword throughout this deal and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated .thank you for your anticipated co-operation while I look forward to a matually benefitting business relation with you. Please Reach me on my Email Address above,  Treat as strictly confidential for obvious reasons you know I am still in service. \n\nYours faithfully \nDr. S. Usman. \n\nD .G.\n\n\n\n"

Agora ? a vez dos parlamentares ga?chos, leg?timos representantes dos anseios da nossa sociedade, fazerem a parte que lhes cabe. O programa \"Casseta e Planeta\", deve estar no topo de qualquer lista de boicote contra o lixo televisivo que agride e ofende sociedade.\nSr(a). Parlamentar, eu j? fa?o a minha parte, boicotando este  programa-lixo, a Globo, a RBS TV e os anunciantes que os financiam. Conto com a sua atua??o firme e decidida na defesa da dignidade do nosso povo e da nossa cultura, colocando o \"Casseta e Planeta\" na posi??o que lhe ? justa na lista da CDH de programas a serem boicotados, ou seja, de mais racista, ofensivo, discriminat?rio e desmoralizante programa da televis?o brasileira. A efic?cia da sua atua??o ser? lembrada pelos ga?chos na pr?xima elei??o.\nManifesto tamb?m a minha grande insatisfa??o pelo fato de empresas p?blicas, como a Petrobr?s, estarem financiando este programa infame. Se o boicote que conduzimos precisar ser direcionado para uma campanha de desobedi?ncia civil, com a suspens?o total do pagamento de qualquer imposto, eu apoiarei e participarei.\nAguardando sua resposta a esta minha reclama??o contra este programa, despe?o-me.\nAtenciosamente,\n\n\n\n"

In his position (My father) with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent Kabila, he was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms internationally in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.\nMeanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the sum of US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious stones while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for the Congolese Army.\nMy father went home for the funeral of the late president, but on his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one of our numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father was able to reveal this secret to me and advice that i should proceed to the Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant documents that will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to clear this money is with a finance security company in Holland.\nOn our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for political asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.\nI got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in Belgium. Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the total sum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me and my family.

Due to the land and\npolitical problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President\nRobert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly\naffecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black\nfarmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my\nfather for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.\n \n \n \nBefore he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business\nforeign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in\nmajor companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit\nthe sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred\nthousand US dollars), in a private security company. This\nmoney was deposited with this Private Security company for\nsafety and security reasons, and was to be used for the\npurchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment\nof new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent\nZimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the\nmurder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.\n \nI was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from\nmy father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but\nwhen the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder\nattempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the\nHolland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my\ndecision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security\ncompany from South Africa, has a branch holland and they\nhave moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.\n \nI need to transfer this money to an account and invest part\nof the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee\n(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved\nin any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a\ngenuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can\nbe transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to\nunderstand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future\nand in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.\n \nIf you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is\nto assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the\nsecurity company from their office in Netherlands,\nas it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa\nto their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you\nrepresenting me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.\n \nFirstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your\nassistance, and helping me open an account for the money\nto be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with\nme for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.\nWhichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I\nhave also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of\nexpenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%\n($580,000,00) for Charity donation.\n \nIf you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an\naccount,\nthen 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want\nyou\nmaintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.\nI look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you\nin\nadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my\ndirect line which is +31-630-854-650 or via email,\nwolny_olkusz@indiatimes.com\n \n \n \n \nSincerely,\n \nWolny Olkusz.\n\n\n\n"

I have followed all the required official \ncontract award/ payment procedures, and all \ndocuments to facilitate the smooth conclusion of \nthis transaction are legitimate and officially in \norder. \n\nThere is no problem, this contract is LEGAL. THIS \nTRANSACTION IS A BUSINESS DEAL BETWEEN YOU AND I, \nBUT IT IS LEGITIMATE AND GENUINE TO THE AUTHORITIES. \nI want to assure you that you have nothing to fear \nabout, your main priority should be to give us your \ntotal co-operation, And follow my advice \n/instructions. You should consider this transaction \nas already successful & concluded. \n\nWhat is required is for me to have you registered as \na foreign contractor with my ministry as category \n'A' contractor for this I would require you to \nprovide me with your company name, address and phone \nwith fax number for the registration, it is after \nthis has been done that I will make you the sole \nbeneficiary of the fund and submit for payment \nprocessing to your nominated account to the relevant \nministry. \n\nConsider this transaction as successful and \ncompleted for I have taken  care of all modalities \nand official procedures involved legitimately \nand as required. \n\nNote clearly that as top Government officials in \nNigeria, occupying very sensitive top Government \nposition we receive little salaries compared to our \npositions. Once more I want you to understand that \nthis transaction is 100% risk free. \n\nWe will discuss the percentage to be given to you \nbefore we proceed. \n\nBest Wishes, \n\nMR USMAN IDIRIS (Engr) \nN.B: Reply to alternative email address \n\n\n\n"

B.N}\n\nDear Sir,\n\n\nFirst, i must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. however after series of petition was recieved by this present regime from foreign contractors and reports from the world Bank and the International Monetry Fund (I.M.F)as  the inability of the Central Bank of Nigeria to fulfill their obligation for the payment to its foreign creditors, Our Head of State (the president) in conjuntion with the council of ministers,has mandated us to carry out a careful and comprehensive review of all overdue payments to foreign contractors and to effect payments immediately,so as to sanitize the image of our great country caused by the embarrasment. \nIn view of the above,the country has found it very necessary to review some contract files and application submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment. After going through some contracts files and with all application further carefully investigated.I found out  to my greatest surprise that some of them are not the actual Beneficiary of the funds they were about to claim.They were acting in collaboration with some highly placed connected government officials here in Nigeria to claim these money. And I am sure,and in no doubt that this is one of the reason  why the funds has not been transfered into their accounts. Really,this fund is still existing in our government annual report payment schedules on foreign debt as unclaimed and in their favour as the sole beneficiary.But it is really unfortunate that their representative here in Nigeria did not complete the transaction because they dont have the experience and so they abandon them.\nMy main purpose of contacting you is for you to help us to receive this money overseas,All we need from you is for you to stand as a frontier to claim the said fund   we will pouch the money diplomatically to you through a courier company, we have being able to secure $30 .5 million.Every modalities have been put in place to actualise this fund without any hitch,\nWe have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your account. \n1. 25% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. \n2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer. \n3. 65% to us the originators of the transaction\n NOTE: Let honesty,confidentiality and trust be our watchword throughout this deal and your prompt reply will be highly appreciated thank you for your anticipated co-operation while I look forward to a matually benefitting business relation with you. Please Reach me on my Email Address above,  Treat as strictly confidential for obvious reasons you know I am still in service. \n\nYours faithfully \nDr. S. Usman. \n\nD .G.\n\n\n\n"

My name is Mr Segun \nAgbaje, the \nDeputy Managing Director of COMMERICAL BANK OF AFRICA. I am writing in \nrespect \nof a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t \nwho \nperished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole \npassengers \naboard on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this \nour customer,I personally has watched with keen interest to see the \nnext of \nkin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds \nof \nUSD.28.5m,[twenty eight million five hundred thousand united states \ndollars] \nwhich has been with my branch for a very long time. \n\nOn this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the \nnext of \nkin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics \nhere \ndoes not allow such money to stay more than Six years, because money \nwill be \nrecalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view \nof this \nI got your contact through a trade journal after realizing that your \ncountry \nis similar to the deceased. I will give you 15% of the total. \n\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the \napplication, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not \nfail to \nbring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you \nshould not \nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized \nwithin \nfive banking days, after you apply to the bank as a\nrelation to the deceased. \n\nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail to my private \nmail box, \nsignifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers for \nquick \ncommunication. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nMr Segun Agbaje \nseg_agbj1@netscape.net\n\n____________________________________________________________\nCharle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329\n\n\n\n"

The funds will be released to you by the Security Company, based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you are able to help us claim this consignment. We have also decided to give you any money spent on phone calls or traveling expenses in the course of this transaction at the end of the transaction.\nPlease, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this transaction, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly required, due to my family's present predicament. \nI sincerely will appreciate your willingness to assist us as soon as possible.

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access\nreposed on this medium.\nBe informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.\nI have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of  this transaction.\nWithin the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate  Offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.\nThis amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.\n\nI have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel./fax number, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. \nI want to assure you that myself and my partners are in\na position to make the payment of this claim possible\nprovided you can give us a very strong assurance and\nguarantee that our share will be secured and Please\nremember to treat this matter as very confidential\nmatter; because we will not comprehend with any form\nof exposure as we are still in active Government\nService and remember once again that time is of the\nessence in this business.\nI wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I\nam available to entertain any questions concerning the\nclarity of this transaction.\nYours faithfully,\nMr. Shaka Mabela.\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save ?7.50 a month \nwww.freeserve.com/anytime\n\n\n\n"

After the Presidential Election campaign, my late husband [Chief M.K.O.Abiola] withdrew some of his from Nigeria banks and changed them to America dollars which he deposited as consignment with a private security company in oversease for safe keeping with an opened beneficiary stating that the consignment money belongs to the family. \nAfter his death in the year 1998, there was confusion in the entire Abiola's family as regards sharing of the family assets and moreso, there is envy and jealousy as it was obvious that I was my husband's favourite wife,while he was alive. As soon as he passed away, coupled with the fact that, what I have and what is due to me might be taking away from me by greedy family relations whose reasons would be bothering on family tradition and ethics. Now I am therefore asking you to come to my aid in getting this money from  the security company and for a possible onward investment. I should have contaced other members of the family but I'm afraid of doing so because of the way widows are being treated in some African countries. they are often dispossed of their husband's properties without a recourse to   the right of the woman and the children left behind by the deceased. \nMy son, Jimola Abiola is my only son and we share secrets, he stays far away from the family Villa who is just 15 years old. He is a manior and therefore not complete to enter any lagal contract with the security company. \nI will appreciate if you will kindly assist me and my immediate family on this matter,if I may say I'm interested to invest in any good investment that would yied quick turn over but I wish to do a joint partnership with you since I have no any experience on such of if possible, just kindly help me to accomodate this money in  your account while I give you a handsome persentage( say 20% ) of the total sumat the successful completion of the transaction.I would advise that this matter be treated in capsule.\nYou will be adequately compensated for this. Please do get in touch with me urgently on receipt of this mail through my Email address below doyin_abiola@tiscali.co.uk\n\nThanks and remain bleesed,\nSister Doyin Abiola\nFreeserve AnyTime - HALF PRICE for the first 3 months - Save ?7.50 a month \nwww.freeserve.com/anytime\n\n\n\n"

On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a Balance of $36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.\n\nI will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred. If you are interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.\n\nI want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is followed accordingly.

I am contacting you to kindly assit me in the proposition below, which will be of mutual benefit to us both.\n \nPROPOSITION.\nA salvadorean, MR.Ramirez Vidaurre,66years of age and a very prosperous farmer made a huge bank deposit for investment in the sum of US$18,500,000.=(Eighteen Million Five Hundred thousand US Dollars),he named his wife Mrs.Helga Vidaurre as the NEXT OF KIN. I was called upon as an Accredited Attorney to the bank to sign/endorse documents to this deposit on Mr. Vidaurre behalf.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr&Mrs Vidaurre were killed in the January 14,earthquake that rocked El Salvador, killing thousands of people and 1,200 others were declared missing.\n\nThe Bank Management now mandates me (being the lawyer that signed and endorsed the deposit papers for the deceased) to trace the family relatives of the deceased so that the funds will be released to them.I was made to understand that they had no children.\n\nI made several efforts through the El Salvadorean High Commission in lagos to contact any of the deceased family relatives ,but to no avail.\n\nFailure to reach any of the deceased family relatives, the option left for the Bank Management is to declare the deceased account dormant and revert the funds on trading and investment in the interest of the Bank.\n\nInorder to avoid this development,since it has so far been impossible to trace any of the deceased family relatives,I now seek your permission and assistance to have you stand as a distant relative to the deceased since i have used my position as the bank's attorney create an open space to fill in name of next of kin to the decease so that the fund will be released to you and we can use it for our mutual benefit.\n\nI hope you do understand my concern in this matter,that if we don?t use this opportunity to claim this fund ,since the deceased relatives cannot be traced,the management of the bank will declare the deceased account dormant and revert the fund on trading and investment in the interest of the Bank and already the bank have started trading with this money through our corresponding bank oversea and right now the money will easily be paid to the next of kin through our corresponding bank so with the inclusion of your name as the next of kin in the open space will make the bank to return this money back the decease account.\n\nFor your assistance, you will be compensated adequately with (40%) of the total sum,(55%) will be my share,while(5%) will be set aside to cover any incidental expense made both at home and abroad prior to this transaction.\n\nIf you are interested in assisting me with this matter ,please,send to me urgently via my email the details bellow:\n1.Your full name and complete contact address.\n2.Your private telephone and fax number (urgent)\n3.Your date of birth (Age)\n\n\n Upon receiving the above details from you,I will procure a sworn affidavit of support of your claim sataing your name as the next of kin to the decease,information on how you will reach our corresponding bank oversea will be provided for you  for the release and collection of the fund, which will be within one week of my receiving the above details from you.I will meet with you in your country after the fund have been released to you and also to discuss invesntment potentials.\n\nMay I assure you that this transaction is 100 % risk free, as I have taken care of all  necessary modalities  to  enable  a  hitch ? free transaction .  kindly ensure  to  treat  this matter  in  strict  privacy(highly  confidential). I look forward to your urgent response.\n  Cheers and God bless.\n       Best  regards\n\nBARRISTER PAUL ADAMS          \n\n\n\n"

I am Zulu Danjuma, the first and only surviving son of late Marc Masuku Danjuma one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa, to deposit the sum of US$7.5 million (Seven Million Five Hundred United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.\n\nI have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.\n\nThere are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 30% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone & fax numbers. \n\nI await your reply through the above contact e-mail, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.\n\nI shall furnish you with more details on request.\n\nYours truly,\nZULU DANJUMA\n\n\n\n"

Because, The consignment was declared to\ncontain family treasure and valuables.\n\n\nThe fact that the war persist and we continue to\naccumulate huge debts daily as long as the consignment\nremains in the security company?s vault, made me\ndecided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as\npossible to receive these funds\nfor investment purpose. As a young man, I plan to use\nthis money to safeguard my future.\n\n\n\nIt is very essential that you understand the kind of\ntrust and confidence I want to put in you.

However, I\nimplore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost\nsecrecy and confidentiality for security and safety\nreasons, even if you do not intend to execute the\nproject.\n\n\nThank you in anticipation for your assistance in\nenabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me\nwhether or not you are interested in assisting me.\nThis will enable me scout for another perosn in the\nevent of non-interest on your part.\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMr Ralph Taylor\n>\n\n\n"

            "content": "From: Mrs Mary Jones of Kuwait\n\n\nRE: Donation for the less priveledged.\n\n\nI am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married\nto Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait Embassy in\nIvory Coast for nine years before he died in the year\n2000.We were married for eleven years without a child.\nHe died after a brief illness that lasted for only\nfour days. Before his death we were both born again\nchristians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry\nor get a child outside my matrimonial home which the\nBible is against. When my late husband was alive he\ndeposited the sum of $8.6Million (Eight Million six \nhundred  thousand U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security\n\ncompany in Europe. \n\nPresently, this money is still with the Security\nCompany\nand the management  just wrote me as the beneficiary\nto come forward to receive the trunk box of money or\nrather issue a letter of authorisation to somebody to \nreceive it on my behalf if I can not come over.\n\n\nPresently, I'm in a hospital where I have been\nundergoing treatment for oesophageal cancer. I have\nsince lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told\nme that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last\nwish to see this money distributed to victims of this\nfire outbreak in Australia and other charity\norganizations. Because relatives and friends have\nplundered so much of my wealth since my  illness, I\ncannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge\nresponsibility to any of them. \nPlease,I beg you in the name of God to help me collect\nthe deposit and the interest accrued from the company\nand distribute it accordingly.\n\n\nI want a person that is God fearing that will use \nthis money to fund churches,orphanages and widows \npropagating the word of God and to ensure that the \nhouse of God is maintained. The Bible made us to \nunderstand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. \nI took this decision because I don't have any child \nthat will inherit this money and my husband relatives \nare not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard \nearned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't \nwant a situation where this money will be used in \nan ungodly manner.\n\n\nHence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am\nnot afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I\nknow that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.\nExodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case\nand I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone\ncommunication in this regard because of my soundless\nvoice and presence of my husband's relatives around me\nalways. I don't want them to know about this\ndevelopment.\nWith God all things are possible. As soon as I\nreceive your reply I shall give you the contact of the\nFinance/ Security Company in Europe. I will also issue\nyou a letter of authority that will prove you as the\nnew beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the\nchurch to always pray for me because the lord is my\nshephard.\n\n\nMy happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy\nChristian. however that wants to serve the Lord must\nserve him in spirit and truth. Please always be\nprayerful all through your life. Any delay in your\nreply will give me room in sourcing for another person\nfor this same purpose.\n\n\nPlease assure me that you will act accordingly as I \nstated herein.\n\n\nHoping to hearing from you soon. \n\n\nN.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYERS IN\nCHARGE A CALL IN IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY\nBEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE\nWILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS WITH THE\nFOLLOWING DETAILS:\n\n\nNames:                  Ben Smith Medube\nEmail:                  \nSatellete phone:        +874 762921845\n\n\n\nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\n\n\nYours in Christ,\n\n\nMrs Mary Jones  \n\n\n\n"

Lamar,the wife of Chief Williams .T. Lamar(the former financial Director of Sierra Leone national minning corporation) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Foday Sankoh after overthrowing the elected government of President Tejan Kabah, though I do not know to what extent you are familiar with this events and disturbances in Sierra Leone but it has consistent features in news and bulletins.The pressure of war drove the rest of our family out of Sierra Leone into exile in Spain(Madrid) where we have been living under political asylum for 4 months now. \n \nSadly,my mother died of cancer 2 months after our arrival into spain, i am now here with my 2 children and myself,But before the death of my husband he has handed over to me a certificate meant for a secret deposited trunk box which my father made in a security company in Madrid Spain, and he disclosed to me that the trunk box contains US$25,000.000.00 Million Dollars. \n \nThe money was paid to the minning corporation under him by it's overseas customers in the heat of the war but he made the deposit in his name with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed when the conflict intensified as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces.I have contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and established ownership. \n \nDue to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra Leone,I have decided to solicit for the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person that will assist me in the withdrawal of the trunk box for investment purposes.I cannot do it alone due to my present status and total ignorance in business and investment as I was in school before the outbreak of the war. \n \nYou will be given a nogotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.If you are trustworthy and interested in the proposal, contact me immediately for more details.You must maintain absolute confidentiality to ensure success also include your personal telephone number when replying.It is very important to note that during my fact finding mission to establish ownership of the subject matter, I decided here and now to write you this mail.

Now we are rising funds for the building of a Shelter\nfor Homeless People and a Canteen for feeding the Homeless and Poor in our\nCommunity. We are primarily sponsored by Non government organizations and\ngood hearted people that share a small amount of money or give useless for\nthem, but useful for us, items, which can be used in the new canteen.\nNow our fundraising campaign is based on two things - the usual - Donations\nand the Selling of The Bible E-Book - Computer version of the Original\nTranslation of the Holly Bible made from King James in the year 1611. The\noriginal text was retyped and converted into Adobe PDF computer book.\nWe are trying to sell as much as we can because all the money raised from\nthe sales are going for the financing of the \"Feed The Homeless and Poor\nPeople\" project. In that way, we want to maximize the income in order to be\ncapable of realizing this project and bring little bit more joy in the hard\nlife of our poor brothers and sisters out there.\nThe \"Feed the Homeless and Poor People\" is organized by \"The Church of St.\nGeorge\". We we invited to help our church in this act of generosity, after\nthe government denied the budget of this project. Practically the\ngovernment tolled us that it is not their problem and we have to find the\nfunds yourself. Because of This NOW we are asking you to help us in this\nhumanitarian mission and make a donation for our project as much as you\ncan. Even the little will be appreciated, and all hungry poor people will\nbe very grateful for your act of generosity.\nThe Church of St. George asks all people to show some generosity and give\nsomething to help this project come true.\nPlease think about the Homeless People outside of your home, staying in the\ncold, hungry, dirty, having nobody to share this wonderful Christian\nHolidays. The Church of St. George asks you all to help those people\nhowever you can. Donate some money for the building of the Homeless Shelter\nor The Canteen. All this is going to be appreciated.\nEven if you are not capable of giving us something, please be more generous\nto the poor and homeless outside of your home. Give them something to eat,\nsome old warm cloth, they will be very happy receive anything. Please\nremember the words of God, saying that we should be nice to the people, to\nreceive the same.\nPlease buy this book, and the money earned from it's sales will be donated\nto that project. You don't have anything to loose. Either ways, you will\nrecieve one of the best (to me) versions of The Holly Bible.\nClick Here to Enter Our Website and give your Donation or Buy Our Book\n\n And God said: \"Give To the Poor, And You Shall Be Given!\"\n \n\nPlease visit our web site for more details about our projects.\nIf you don't want to receive this mail again, please reply with subject\n\"REMOVE\", but If you believe in our cause, please forward this e-mail to\neverybody you know.

Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa, to deposit the sum of US$7.5 million (Seven Million Five Hundred United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.\n\nI have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you.

Note that, these funds emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of contracting firms who could not meet their financial obligation to their creditors. Consequently, these firms went bankrupt and total liquidation.\n\nWe as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatals were mandated by the Federal Government to scrutinize all payment made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement which collectively left an amazing sum of US$26,500,000.00 Only (Twenty Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) lying in a suspense Account.  However, from our extensive investigation, we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies have since been liquidated and no longer existing for some years which motivated our intention, knowing fully well that all operations would be exceedingly smooth and completely safe for all the parties concerned.\nWe have agreed on this side that the said amount would be transferred (for own use) into a Bank Account provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate, because we are serving Government workers and the Civil Service Code does not allow us to operate foreign Account/Company, more so there must be some sort of documents to show that it is for the contract that the funds is released for.\n\nFollowing our intention to carry out this laudable project expediently we however, succeeded in transferring part of this amount (money) precisely US$5M (Five Million US Dollars) only into a Foreign Bank Account in Switzerland, but the provider of the Account is up to some mischief and refused to comply with our earlier mutual agreement insisting that the total amount be paid into his nominated Bank Account before disbursement will take effect.  We thus, believe and concluded that if in the first successful transfer of US$5M (Five Million US$ Dollars) we were not compensated how then are we sure that when the balance of US$21,500,000.00 Only, (Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) is transferred into his Account that we will be sure of our due compensation.\nIn light of the foregoing, we are therefore seeking your assistance so that the remaining amount of US$21,500,000.00 only can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your nominated Bank Account.\nYou are expected therefore to furnish us with your company and bank details i.e.\n(1) Name of company and addr(2) Name of nominated Bank Account suitable for this project, with ABA or Swift Code (If any)\n(3) Name of Beneficiary to the Account.\nOn successful remittance of the fund into your Account you will be compensated with 20% of the amount for your valuable assistance and co-operation. So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction, neither can we give our identities as regards our respective offices, but were relationship confidently established and smooth operations commences, you will be furnished with all you deserve to know.\nI am disposed to entertain any question(s) from you with respect to this transaction, Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency, for confidentiality reasons and to avoid exposure, please direct your  reply to the under detailed Telephone and Fax number.\nYours faithfully,\n\nMR.ERNEST COLMAN.\n\nEMAIL:ernestcolman@netscape.net\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

For\nthe king and his three fellow-scholars are of course soon forsworn,\nand turn to writing sonnets, each to his chosen lady.  These fellow-\nscholars of the king--\"quaint votaries of science\" at first,\nafterwards \"affection's men-at-arms\"--three youthful knights,\ngallant, amorous, chivalrous, but also a little affected, sporting\nalways a curious foppery of language, are, throughout, the leading\nfigures in the foreground; one of them, in particular, being more\ncarefully depicted than the others, and in himself very noticeable--a\nportrait with somewhat puzzling manner and expression, which at once\ncatches the eye irresistibly and keeps it fixed.\n\nPlay is often that about which people are most serious; and the\nhumourist may observe how, under all love of playthings, there is\nalmost always hidden an appreciation of something really engaging and\ndelightful.  This is true always of the toys of children: it is often\ntrue of the playthings of grown-up people, their vanities, their\nfopperies even, their lighter loves; the cynic would add their\npursuit of fame.  Certainly, this is true without exception [165] of\nthe playthings of a past age, which to those who succeed it are\nalways full of a pensive interest--old manners, old dresses, old\nhouses.

Such modes or\nfashions are, at their best, an example of the artistic predominance\nof form over matter; of the manner of the doing of it over the thing\ndone; and have a beauty of their own.  It is so with that old\neuphuism of the Elizabethan age--that pride of dainty language and\ncurious expression, which it is very easy to ridicule, which often\nmade itself ridiculous, but which had below it a real sense of\nfitness and nicety; and which, as we see in this very play, and still\nmore clearly in the Sonnets, had some fascination for the young\nShakespeare himself.  It is this foppery of delicate language, this\nfashionable plaything of his time, with which Shakespeare is occupied\nin Love's Labours Lost.  He shows us the manner in all its stages;\npassing from the grotesque and vulgar pedantry of Holofernes, through\nthe extravagant but polished caricature of Armado, to become the\npeculiar characteristic of a real though still quaint poetry in Biron\nhimself, who is still chargeable even at his best with just a little\naffectation.

To assist you with marketing your business_on the internet,\nthe 5 \nreports you purchase will_provide you with invaluable marketing \ninformation_which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,_where to find \nthousands of free classified ads and_much more. There are 2 primary methods\nto \nget this_venture going:__METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \n==================================================__Let's say that you\ndecide to \nstart small, just to see_how it goes, and we will assume you and those \ninvolved_send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume_that the\nmailing \nreceives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)_response (the response could be much\nbetter \nbut let's_just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send_out\nhundreds of \nthousands of e-mails instead of only_5,000 each.__Continuing with this\nexample, \nyou send out only_5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only_10\norders \nfor report # 1. Those 10 people responded_by sending out 5,000 e-mails each\nfor \na total of_50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%_responded with\norders. \nThat's 100 people who_responded and ordered Report # 2.__Those 100 people\nmail \nout 5,000 e-mails each for_a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response\nto_that \nis 1000 orders for Report # 3.__Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each\nfor \na_total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%_response is 10,000 orders\nfor \nReport # 4.__Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each_for a total of \n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails._The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders \nfor_Report # 5.__THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00_(half a \nmillion dollars).__Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50_+\n2..... \n$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000_+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand \nTotal=$555,550.00__NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND_FIGURE\nOUT \nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO_MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL \nSTILL_MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! \n==================================================__REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS\nIS \nASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE_ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to\nthink_for a \nmoment what would happen if everyone or half_or even one 4th of those\npeople \nmailed 100,000_e-mails each or more?__There are over 150 million people on\nthe \ninternet_worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming_online every\nday. \nBelieve me, many people will do_just that, and more!__METHOD # 2: BY\nPLACING \nFREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n==================================================__Advertising on the net\nis \nvery, very inexpensive and_there are hundreds of FREE places to \nadvertise._Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will_easily get a\nlarger \nresponse. We strongly suggest_you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2\nas \nyou_go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must_do is e-mail them the \nreport they ordered. That's it._Always provide same day service on all \norders.__This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,_with your name\nand \naddress on it, will be prompt_because they cannot advertise until they \nreceive_the report.__===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================_The \nreason for the \"cash\" is not because this is_illegal or somehow \"wrong\". It\nis \nsimply about time._Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared\nor_approved, \netc. Concealing it is simply so no one_can SEE there is money in the\nenvelope \nand steal_it before it gets to you.__ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp;\nNAME \nONLY._Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for_each report. Checks\nNOT \naccepted. Make sure the_cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least_2\nsheets of \npaper. On one of those sheets of_paper, write the NUMBER &amp; the NAME of\nthe \nreport_you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your_name and postal \naddress.__PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \n==================================================__REPORT # 1: \"The\nInsider's \nGuide To Advertising for Free On The Net\"_Order Report #1 from: Thomasaguy \n#103-1311 Lawson Avenue Kelowna, BC, Canada, V1Y 6V2__ \n________________________________________________________REPORT # 2: \"The \nInsider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net\"_Order Report #2\nfrom:_C.M._AV. \nGilberta Paiva, 12 - 1D_4520-169 S.M.
