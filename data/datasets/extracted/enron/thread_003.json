            "content": "    \n\nFrom: Mrs. Susan Shabangu.\n\nGreetings to you,\n\nI humbly offer my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. Howe\nver strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met per\nsonally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due conside\nration of its importance and the immense benefit it will be to you.\n\nAfter careful consideration with my children, we resolved to contact you for yo\nur most needed assistance in this manner. I duly apologize for infringing on yo\nur privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal t\no you as a person of integrity.\n\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mrs.\nSusan Shabangu, mother of three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy\nof The Republic of South Africa for seven years running You may view my profile\n on the following link; http://www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm\n\nI will now give you a general overview of the situation.\n\nWhen I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my\ninfluence, my husband Mr. Ndelebe Shabangu a very successful businessman was aw\narded several contracts in my ministry and had direct dealings with foreign inv\nestors in this field. Due to my political status, I was not involved in my husb\nand's business which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband died whil\nst on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in February 2001.\n\nWhen my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin by a private security firm\n in Europe to come forth with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety dep\nosit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At that time, my children and I\n did not have an idea where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the se\ncurity firm to continue holding the safety deposit until further instructions f\nrom me. Whilst preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I wa\ns going through his library collection and to my astonishment I discovered a Ce\nrtificate of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private security firm, an\nd other documents relating to the safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit\nwhich is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US Dollars) totalling $18,500,\n000 which was generated from cash payments from his business associates in the\ndiamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nThough I knew my late husband was in the diamond business, I did not have the k\nnowledge that he moved funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my chi\nldren, and we have decided to have this fund invested immediately, as any membe\nr of my family cannot hold such a huge amount in our name due to my political s\ntatus, hence we sincerely propose to you to render us your most needed assistan\nce in this regard.\n\nIf you accept to render us your assistance, your role in this project will be t\no act on my behalf as a trustee to receive the funds in your Country for immedi\nate investments commercial and residential properties abroad as well as profita\nble ventures. Though I believe this transaction should be based on mutuality, m\ny family's interest will be protected by a family associate, who is an lawyer a\nttached to the South African Embassy in the country where the security firm is\nlocated. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and will assist in making arran\ngements for release of the safety deposit, and transfer of the funds. I have in\nformed him that I am locating one of my husband's business associates (you) to\nhandle the funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed to my decisio\nn to have you as a business partner if he found out that I barely know you.\n\nFor your reliable assistance, we are offering you 15 %($2,775,000) of the funds\n.\n\nI thank you in advance as we anticipate your assistance in enabling us achieve\nthis goal. On hearing from you, I will forward your contact to the gentleman la\nwyer who will be representing us, and also give you his contact for both of you\n to communicate and proceed with the transaction. He will be working with you f\nor a mutual conclusion of the process and I look forward to a long lasting busi\nness relationship with you. As you may understand, due to my sensitive position\n in the present government, it is not safe to communicate with me via phone or\nfax. This is why I have communicated with you with my private email address, an\nd I like us to keep this way, for the safety of this transaction.\n\nPlease contact me on my private email address; shabangus56@netscape.net whether\n or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternativ\ne plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.\n\nWith warm regards,\nMrs. S. Shabangu.\n\n\n"

            "content": "    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Page 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/p>\n\n\nYEAR OLD\n- FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET!\n\nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release. If you would like to\nunderstand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please\n\ncontinue\nreading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on\nthe net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just\n\nfollow the simple instructions].\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBE\n\nFINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say &quot;Bull&quot;,\n\nplease read the following. This is the\n\nletter you have been hearing\nabout on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\nInternet, a national\n\nweekly news program recently devoted an entire \nshow\nto\nthe investigation of this program described below, to see if\n\nit really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved\n\nonce and for all that there \nare\n\n&quot;absolutely NO Laws prohibiting\nthe\nparticipation in the program\nand if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to\nmake some megabucks\n\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost&quot;.\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\n\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.\n\nNOTE* follow the directions below, I hade best results the\n\nsecond time\nwhen I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports\ninstructions.\n\nI have been\n\nasked many times to recommend whom to use. However, after\nusing one particular company many, many times and had absolutely\n\nno\nproblems with them. I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of\na\ndiscount offer. They will send 1\n\nmillion email offers for $250 or 5\nmillion for $1000. Remember this is recommended not Required. In order\nfor\nall of\n\nus to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the\nreturns are many. I have been extremely successful using\n\nthe this\ncompany. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for\nreports,\nthen I send back to the people\n\nas soon as possible\n\nThis is what one had to say: &quot;Thanks to this profitable\nopportunity. I was approached many\n\ntimes before but each time I passed\non it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return\n\nfor the minimal effort and money required. To my\nastonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money \nstill\ncoming\n\nin&quot;.\n\n Pam Hedland,\n\nFort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHere is another testimonial: &quot;This program has\n\nbeen around for a long\ntime but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again\nin the mail I decided to\n\ngamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.\nFirst\n\nmonth I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na\ntotal of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\n\nby re- entering the\nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The\nkey to success in this program\n\nis to follow the simple steps and NOT\nchange anything.&quot;\n\n\nMore testimonials later but first,\n\n +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++\n\n +++ Order all 5 reports shown on the\n\nlist below +++\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE\nORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL\n\nADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON\nTHAT LIST next to the report.\n\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR\n\nENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER\nin\ncase of any mail problems.\n\nWhen you place your order, make sure you order each\n\nof the 5 reports.\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\nWithin a few days you will\n\nreceive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports\nfrom these 5 different individuals.

To assist you with\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase \nwill\n\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to\nsend\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find\n\nthousands of free classified ads\nand much more. There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD\n\n#1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLet's say\n\nthat you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only\n\n5,000e-mails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the\nresponse could be much better\n\nbut lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for\n\nreport # 1.\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total\nof 50,000. Out of those 50,000\n\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\nThat equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people\n\nmail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is\n\n10,000 orders for Report\n#4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50\n\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders\nfor Report #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\n\nEACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your\ntotal income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000\n+\n4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND\n\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A\nLOT OF MONEY!\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10\n\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000\nYOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even\n\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or\nmore? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide\n\nand\ncounting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE\n\nINTERNET\n\n&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAdvertising on the net is very\n\nvery inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill\n\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with\nMethod #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5\n\nyou receive,\nall you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all\n\norders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and\naddress on it, will be prompt because\n\nthey can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\n\n++++++++++++++\n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send\n\n$5\ncash\n(U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at\n\nleast 2 sheets of paper or\naluminum\nfoil.

Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release. If you would like to\nunderstand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please\n\ncontinue\nreading.

Before you say &quot;Bull&quot;,\n\nplease read the following. This is the\n\nletter you have been hearing\nabout on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\nInternet, a national\n\nweekly news program recently devoted an entire \nshow\nto\nthe investigation of this program described below, to see if\n\nit really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved\n\nonce and for all that there \nare\n\n&quot;absolutely NO Laws prohibiting\nthe\nparticipation in the program\nand if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to\nmake some megabucks\n\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost&quot;.\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\n\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.\n\nNOTE* follow the directions below, I hade best results the\n\nsecond time\nwhen I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports\ninstructions.\n\nI have been\n\nasked many times to recommend whom to use. However, after\nusing one particular company many, many times and had absolutely\n\nno\nproblems with them. I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of\na\ndiscount offer. They will send 1\n\nmillion email offers for $250 or 5\nmillion for $1000. Remember this is recommended not Required. In order\nfor\nall of\n\nus to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the\nreturns are many. I have been extremely successful using\n\nthe this\ncompany. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for\nreports,\nthen I send back to the people\n\nas soon as possible\n\nThis is what one had to say: &quot;Thanks to this profitable\nopportunity. I was approached many\n\ntimes before but each time I passed\non it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return\n\nfor the minimal effort and money required. To my\nastonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money \nstill\ncoming\n\nin&quot;.\nTo be removed from list send request to quick_del@yahoo.c\nom\n Pam Hedland,\n\nFort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHere is another testimonial: &quot;This program has\n\nbeen around for a long\ntime but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again\nin the mail I decided to\n\ngamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.\nFirst\n\nmonth I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na\ntotal of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\n\nby re- entering the\nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The\nkey to success in this program\n\nis to follow the simple steps and NOT\nchange anything.&quot;\n\n\nMore testimonials later but first,\n\n +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++\n\n +++ Order all 5 reports shown on the\n\nlist below +++\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE\nORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL\n\nADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON\nTHAT LIST next to the report.\n\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR\n\nENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER\nin\ncase of any mail problems.\n\nWhen you place your order, make sure you order each\n\nof the 5 reports.\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\nWithin a few days you will\n\nreceive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports\nfrom these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they\nwill\n\nbe accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will\norder them from you.

To assist you with\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase \nwill\n\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to\nsend\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find\n\nthousands of free classified ads\nand much more. There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD\n\n#1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLet's say\n\nthat you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only\n\n5,000e-mails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the\nresponse could be much better\n\nbut lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for\n\nreport # 1.\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total\nof 50,000. Out of those 50,000\n\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\nThat equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people\n\nmail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is\n\n10,000 orders for Report\n#4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50\n\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders\nfor Report #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\n\nEACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your\ntotal income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000\n+\n4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND\n\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A\nLOT OF MONEY!\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10\n\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000\nYOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even\n\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or\nmore? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide\n\nand\ncounting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE\n\nINTERNET\n\n&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAdvertising on the net is very\n\nvery inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill\n\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with\nMethod #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5\n\nyou receive,\nall you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all\n\norders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and\naddress on it, will be prompt because\n\nthey can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\nTo be removed from list send request to quick_del@yahoo.c\nom\n++++++++++++++\n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY.

To assist you with\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase \nwill\n\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to\nsend\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find\n\nthousands of free classified ads\nand much more. There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD\n\n#1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLet's say\n\nthat you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only\n\n5,000e-mails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the\nresponse could be much better\n\nbut lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for\n\nreport # 1.\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total\nof 50,000. Out of those 50,000\n\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\nThat equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people\n\nmail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is\n\n10,000 orders for Report\n#4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50\n\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders\nfor Report #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\n\nEACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your\ntotal income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000\n+\n4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND\n\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A\nLOT OF MONEY!\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10\n\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000\nYOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even\n\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or\nmore? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide\n\nand\ncounting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE\n\nINTERNET\n\n&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAdvertising on the net is very\n\nvery inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill\n\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with\nMethod #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5\n\nyou receive,\nall you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all\n\norders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and\naddress on it, will be prompt because\n\nthey can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\nPlease send email at this link to be removed rememail@hot\nmail.com\n++++++++++++++\n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY.

Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release.

Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release. If you would like to\nunderstand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please\n\ncontinue\nreading.

However, after\nusing one particular company many, many times and had absolutely\n\nno\nproblems with them. I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of\na\ndiscount offer. They will send 1\n\nmillion email offers for $250 or 5\nmillion for $1000. Remember this is recommended not Required. In order\nfor\nall of\n\nus to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the\nreturns are many. I have been extremely successful using\n\nthe this\ncompany. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for\nreports,\nthen I send back to the people\n\nas soon as possible\n\nThis is what one had to say: &quot;Thanks to this profitable\nopportunity. I was approached many\n\ntimes before but each time I passed\non it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return\n\nfor the minimal effort and money required.

Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release. If you would like to\nunderstand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please\n\ncontinue\nreading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on\nthe net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just\n\nfollow the simple instructions].\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBE\n\nFINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say &quot;Bull&quot;,\n\nplease read the following. This is the\n\nletter you have been hearing\nabout on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\nInternet, a national\n\nweekly news program recently devoted an entire \nshow\nto\nthe investigation of this program described below, to see if\n\nit really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved\n\nonce and for all that there \nare\n\n&quot;absolutely NO Laws prohibiting\nthe\nparticipation in the program\nand if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to\nmake some megabucks\n\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost&quot;.\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\n\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.\n\nNOTE* follow the directions below, I hade best results the\n\nsecond time\nwhen I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports\ninstructions.\n\nI have been\n\nasked many times to recommend whom to use. However, after\nusing one particular company many, many times and had absolutely\n\nno\nproblems with them. I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of\na\ndiscount offer. They will send 1\n\nmillion email offers for $250 or 5\nmillion for $1000. Remember this is recommended not Required. In order\nfor\nall of\n\nus to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the\nreturns are many. I have been extremely successful using\n\nthe this\ncompany. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for\nreports,\nthen I send back to the people\n\nas soon as possible\n\nThis is what one had to say: &quot;Thanks to this profitable\nopportunity. I was approached many\n\ntimes before but each time I passed\non it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return\n\nfor the minimal effort and money required. To my\nastonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money \nstill\ncoming\n\nin&quot;.\nDear Recipeint, Click her to be removed clearoffemail@hot\nmail.com\n Pam Hedland,\n\nFort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHere is another testimonial: &quot;This program has\n\nbeen around for a long\ntime but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again\nin the mail I decided to\n\ngamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.\nFirst\n\nmonth I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na\ntotal of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\n\nby re- entering the\nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The\nkey to success in this program\n\nis to follow the simple steps and NOT\nchange anything.&quot;\n\n\nMore testimonials later but first,\n\n +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++\n\n +++ Order all 5 reports shown on the\n\nlist below +++\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE\nORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL\n\nADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON\nTHAT LIST next to the report.\n\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR\n\nENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER\nin\ncase of any mail problems.\n\nWhen you place your order, make sure you order each\n\nof the 5 reports.\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\nWithin a few days you will\n\nreceive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports\nfrom these 5 different individuals.

To assist you with\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase \nwill\n\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to\nsend\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find\n\nthousands of free classified ads\nand much more. There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD\n\n#1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLet's say\n\nthat you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only\n\n5,000e-mails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the\nresponse could be much better\n\nbut lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for\n\nreport # 1.\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total\nof 50,000. Out of those 50,000\n\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\nThat equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people\n\nmail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is\n\n10,000 orders for Report\n#4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50\n\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders\nfor Report #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\n\nEACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your\ntotal income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000\n+\n4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND\n\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A\nLOT OF MONEY!\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10\n\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000\nYOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even\n\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or\nmore? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide\n\nand\ncounting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE\n\nINTERNET\n\n&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAdvertising on the net is very\n\nvery inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill\n\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with\nMethod #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along.

That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all\n\norders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and\naddress on it, will be prompt because\n\nthey can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\nDear Recipeint, Click her to be removed clearoffemail@hot\nmail.com\n++++++++++++++\n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY.

In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release.

Before you say &quot;Bull&quot;,\n\nplease read the following. This is the\n\nletter you have been hearing\nabout on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\nInternet, a national\n\nweekly news program recently devoted an entire \nshow\nto\nthe investigation of this program described below, to see if\n\nit really\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved\n\nonce and for all that there \nare\n\n&quot;absolutely NO Laws prohibiting\nthe\nparticipation in the program\nand if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to\nmake some megabucks\n\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost&quot;.\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\n\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.\n\nNOTE* follow the directions below, I hade best results the\n\nsecond time\nwhen I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports\ninstructions.\n\nI have been\n\nasked many times to recommend whom to use. However, after\nusing one particular company many, many times and had absolutely\n\nno\nproblems with them. I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of\na\ndiscount offer. They will send 1\n\nmillion email offers for $250 or 5\nmillion for $1000. Remember this is recommended not Required. In order\nfor\nall of\n\nus to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the\nreturns are many. I have been extremely successful using\n\nthe this\ncompany. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for\nreports,\nthen I send back to the people\n\nas soon as possible\n\nThis is what one had to say: &quot;Thanks to this profitable\nopportunity. I was approached many\n\ntimes before but each time I passed\non it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return\n\nfor the minimal effort and money required. To my\nastonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money \nstill\ncoming\n\nin&quot;.\nTo be removed from list send request to quick_del@yahoo.c\nom\n Pam Hedland,\n\nFort Lee, New Jersey.\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nHere is another testimonial: &quot;This program has\n\nbeen around for a long\ntime but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again\nin the mail I decided to\n\ngamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.\nFirst\n\nmonth I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na\ntotal of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\n\nby re- entering the\nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The\nkey to success in this program\n\nis to follow the simple steps and NOT\nchange anything.&quot;\n\n\nMore testimonials later but first,\n\n +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++\n\n +++ Order all 5 reports shown on the\n\nlist below +++\n\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME &amp; NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE\nORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL\n\nADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON\nTHAT LIST next to the report.\n\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR\n\nENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER\nin\ncase of any mail problems.\n\nWhen you place your order, make sure you order each\n\nof the 5 reports.\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\nWithin a few days you will\n\nreceive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports\nfrom these 5 different individuals.

To assist you with\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase \nwill\n\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to\nsend\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find\n\nthousands of free classified ads\nand much more. There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD\n\n#1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLet's say\n\nthat you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only\n\n5,000e-mails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the\nresponse could be much better\n\nbut lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for\n\nreport # 1.\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total\nof 50,000. Out of those 50,000\n\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\nThat equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people\n\nmail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is\n\n10,000 orders for Report\n#4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50\n\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders\nfor Report #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\n\nEACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your\ntotal income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000\n+\n4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND\n\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A\nLOT OF MONEY!\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10\n\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000\nYOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even\n\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or\nmore? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide\n\nand\ncounting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE\n\nINTERNET\n\n&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAdvertising on the net is very\n\nvery inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill\n\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with\nMethod #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5\n\nyou receive,\nall you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all\n\norders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and\naddress on it, will be prompt because\n\nthey can not advertise until they\nreceive the report.\nTo be removed from list send request to quick_del@yahoo.c\nom\n++++++++++++++\n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER &amp; NAME ONLY.

In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release.

They will send 1\n\nmillion email offers for $250 or 5\nmillion for $1000. Remember this is recommended not Required. In order\nfor\nall of\n\nus to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the\nreturns are many. I have been extremely successful using\n\nthe this\ncompany.

To assist you with\nmarketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase \nwill\n\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to\nsend\nbulk e-mails legally, where to find\n\nthousands of free classified ads\nand much more. There are 2 Primary\nmethods to get this venture going:\n\nMETHOD\n\n#1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nLet's say\n\nthat you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only\n\n5,000e-mails each.\nLet's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the\nresponse could be much better\n\nbut lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for\n\nreport # 1.\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total\nof 50,000. Out of those 50,000\n\ne-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.\nThat equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people\n\nmail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is\n\n10,000 orders for Report\n#4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000,000 (50\n\nmillion) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\norders\nfor Report #5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5\n\nEACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your\ntotal income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000\n+\n4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000........Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL &amp; PAPER AND\n\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL\nSTILL MAKE A\nLOT OF MONEY!\n\n&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10\n\nPEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000\nYOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\nor half or even\n\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or\nmore? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide\n\nand\ncounting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE\n\nINTERNET\n\n&gt;+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nAdvertising on the net is very\n\nvery inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill\n\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with\nMethod #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along.

Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release. If you would like to\nunderstand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please\n\ncontinue\nreading.

Before you say &quot;Bull&quot;,\n\nplease read the following. This is the\n\nletter you have been hearing\nabout on the news lately.

The show also investigated whether or not the\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved\n\nonce and for all that there \nare\n\n&quot;absolutely NO Laws prohibiting\nthe\nparticipation in the program\nand if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to\nmake some megabucks\n\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost&quot;.\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &amp; RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\n\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.\n\nNOTE* follow the directions below, I hade best results the\n\nsecond time\nwhen I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports\ninstructions.\n\nI have been\n\nasked many times to recommend whom to use. However, after\nusing one particular company many, many times and had absolutely\n\nno\nproblems with them. I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of\na\ndiscount offer.

Also\nmany people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only\n5,000\n\neach). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000\ne-mails.

Of course it does. You most likely\nhave just seen this story recently featured on a\n\nmajor nightly news\nprogram (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \nof\nthe\nwoods - New\n\nZealand).\n\nHis mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a\nlarge brown paper bag that was\n\nsuspiciously buried beneath some clothes\nand a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing\ncould\n\nhave prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag\nand\nfound it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills,\n\ntwenties, fifties and\nhundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in libeled piles.\n\n&quot;My first thought was that he had\n\nrobbed a bank&quot;, says the\n41-year-old woman, &quot;There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --\nthat's more than\n\nmy husband earns in a year&quot;.\n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he\nworked to\n\ntell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and\nthey drove together to the boys school and picked him up.\n\nLittle did\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\nactually finding it in the closet.\n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of\n&quot;Report&quot; to E-mail addresses that he\n\nobtained off the Internet. \nEveryday\n\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\ncomputer in his bedroom.\n\n&quot;I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my\nname on it like\n\nthe instructions said and I started sending it out&quot;,\nsays\nthe clever 15-year-old.\n\nThe E-mail letter listed\n\n5 addresses and contained instructions to send\none $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address\nat the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your\nname to the top of the list.\n\nThe letter\n\ngoes on to state that you would receive several thousand\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the\n\nletter\nwith your name at the top of the 5-address list. &quot;I get junk E-mail all\n\nthe time, and really did not think\n\nit was going to work&quot;, the boy\ncontinues.\n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post\n\nOffice\nBox that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine\nsubscriptions began to fill up with not\n\nmagazines, but envelopes\ncontaining $5\nbills.\n\n&quot;About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office\n\nand my box\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\nyellow slip that said I had to go up\n\nto the [post office] counter.\n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)&quot;. He goes on, &quot;I wen\nt\nup\n\nto the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had\nto ride back home and empty out my backpack because I\n\ncould not carry \nit\n\nall&quot;.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the\nE-mail.&quot;The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and\nstashing it in the closet, barely had time for\n\nmy homework&quot;.He had also\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging\nthe $5 bills for\n\ntwenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n&quot;I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to\ndifferent banks\n\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I\nwould\nusually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had\n\nsent me in to\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady\ngave me a really strange look and\n\ntold me that she would not be able to\ndo\nit for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode\nto\n\nthe next bank down the street (laughs).&quot;\n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The\nreporting news team examined and investigated the so-called\n&quot;chain-letter&quot; the\nboy was sending out and found\n\nthat it was not a chain-letter at all. In\nfact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws,\nTitle\n\n18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US\ncode, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16,\n\nSections 255\nand 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money\nreceived.\n\nEvery five-dollar\n\nbill that he received contained a little note that\nread, &quot;Please send me report number XYX&quot;.This simple note\n\nmade the\nletter\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a\nfive-dollar fee.\n\n[This\n\nis the end of the media release. If you would like to\nunderstand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please\n\ncontinue\nreading.

I am an\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\nWhen\n\n\nHi,To be removed from list send request to quick_del@yahoo.com\n/font>\nI received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving &quot;junk\n\nmail&quot;.\nI made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population\nand percentages involved. I\n\n&quot;knew&quot; it wouldn't work. Jody totally\nignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\n\nwith\nboth\nfeet. I made merciless fun of\nher, and was ready to lay the old &quot;I told you so&quot; on her when the\n\nthing\ndidn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received\n50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\n\nhad received total $\n147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her\n&quot;hobby&quot;.\n\n Mitchell\nWolf, Chicago, Illinois\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n&quot;Not being the gambling type, it took me several\n\nweeks to make up my\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided\nthat the initial investment\n\nwas so little that there was just no way\nthat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back&quot;. &quot;I\n\n\nwas\n\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first\n\n12\nweeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where\npeople live. There simply isn't a better\n\ninvestment with a faster\nreturn and so big&quot;.\n\n Dan Sondstro\nm,\nAlberta, Canada\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n&quot;I had received this program before.

I had to send the\nmessage\nstraightaway because of the short time involved in\nwhat\nI demand of you.  Please treat this message with\nutmost\nseriousness and swiftness.\n\n\nApart from the fact that you will be adequately\nrewarded,\nI will forever show my gratitude.\nI am Mr. Aroujo Tao Savimbi, son of the late Angolan\nLeader\nJonas Savimbi who was killed  year ago.  I got your\ncontact\ndetails from the internet because I really have no\ntime and\nI needed an anonymous person abroad whom I hope I can\ntrust.\nI pray I am not making wrong judgement by coming to\nyou.\n\n\nJonas Savimbi deposited a large sum of money with a\nsecurity\nvault in Europe  that is my late father.\nThe movement\nof members of his family (including me) is restricted.\n\nOur movement are monitored but I have managed to enter\n\nspain where I intend to lie very low until I complete\nthis\ntransaction with you.  Other members of my family and\nI do not\nhave access to any of these deposits with banks in\nAngola and ,America\n so you can see how desperately we need your\nassistance.\nBoth government officials and fraudulent relatives are\ntrying\nto get their hands on my father's wealth by claiming\nthat the\nwealth was gotten through arms smuggling and illegal\nsale of\ndiamonds.\n\n\nYou can find out more about my late father by checking\nthis\nprofile at URL below:\n\nhttp://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0223/angola.html\nhttp://www.rnw.nl/humanrights/html/vitoria1020814.html\n\nhttp://www.zzam.org/Full/Africa/Angola/History/Angola_History_Leaders.\n\n\nHis wealth is estimated to be over US$1billion and my\nmother,\nbeing the only one with some of the documents has\naided me to\nsneak into european countries as a refugee and conclude this\ntransaction with any one I choose.\n\n\nI have spoken with the security company and the\noperations\nmanager has agreed to release the two trunk boxes in\ntheir\npossession to whomever's name I issue a power of\nattorney\nas the new beneficiary of the deposit. This security\ncompany\nhas US$50,000,000.00 each and precious materials which\nmy\nfather lodged in their safe keep in Europe\nbefore\nhis death so I will give you their contact and\nrelevant documents\nincluding power of attorney to allow you access to the\ntwo trunk boxes of money.\n\n\nThe whole idea is for you to receive this money\nphysically,\nset up bank accounts in  U.S.A and Europe and transfer\nin bits\ninto your home bank accounts before my government even\nknows\nwhat is happening.  My father was a rebel leader in\nAngola\nbefore his death.  You must follow my instructions as\nstated\nabove the transfer of the funds because it will be\ndifficult\nfor the Angolan government to trace my father's money\nto an\nindividuals account moreso, when you have no prior\nrelationship\nwith us.\n\n\nI am currently and temporarily living in Spanish\nrefugee\ncamp and I will be communicating with you on a\nsatellite phone\nand GSM to avoid intervention by the authorities.\nWe have to keep this transaction very secret because\nof the\npolitical situation in Angola at the moment.  I shall\nsend\nyou a password and information that will include power\nof\nattorney and the contact of the security company as\nsoon as\nyou are ready to proceed.\n\n\nCould you please send your full names, address,\nconfidential\ntelephone and fax number to enable me issue a power of\nattorney\nto you and refer you to the security company in\nspain\nfor immediate payment.\n\n\n\nYours sincerely,\nAroujo Tao Saimbi\n\n\n"

Une dizaine\n  d'ann\u00e9es plus tard, il est en ren\u00e9gociation. S'il cela n'a pas\n  fait l'objet d'une m\u00e9diatisation ou d'un d\u00e9bat publique, l'impact\n  sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s des nouvelles conditions de l'accord sera\n  pourtant majeur:\n\n  -Cet accord, sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant, engage les pays signataires \u00e0 ouvrir\n   la totalit\u00e9 ou une partie de leurs march\u00e9s de services locaux \u00e0\n   la concurrence internationale dans les m\u00eames conditions\n   juridiques quel que soit le pays.\n\n  -Les secteurs ainsi ouverts \u00e0 la concurrence ne seront plus r\u00e9gis\n   par les gouvernement \u00e9lus des pays signataires, mais par l'OMC.\n   L'ORD (Organe de R\u00e8glement des Diff\u00e9rends) est charg\u00e9e de passer\n   au peigne fin les textes de loi des pays signataires afin de\n   v\u00e9rifier s'ils sont en accord avec les exigences n\u00e9goci\u00e9es dans\n   le cadre de l'OMC. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant l'OMC pourra prendre les mesures\n   ad\u00e9quates vis \u00e0 vis du pays fautif.\n   La France pourrait par exemple \u00eatre tr\u00e8s vite oblig\u00e9e d'accepter\n   les aliments \u00e0 base d'OGM, la viande \u00e0 base d'hormones, etc...\n\n  -Les conditions devront \u00eatre les m\u00eames entre le public et le\n   priv\u00e9. Par exemple pour chaque subvention de l'\u00e9tat accord\u00e9e\n   au public, une subvention \u00e9quivalente devra \u00eatre accord\u00e9e au\n   priv\u00e9.\n\n  -Un des probl\u00e8mes majeurs que pose cet accord est qu'il est\n   irr\u00e9versible. Il engage - quels que seront les votes futurs\n   des citoyens - les gouvernements, et futurs gouvernements de\n   tous les pays signataires. Si jamais un pays souhaite retirer\n   un, plusieurs, ou tous ses secteurs de cet accords, il devra\n   payer pour compenser le manque \u00e0 gagner des entreprises...\n\n  -Si dans le texte, l'AGCS n'ouvre pas \u00e0 la concurrence les\n   services publics, il faut savoir qu'au sens l'OMC, ne sont\n   des services publics que les services fournis de fa\u00e7on\n   enti\u00e8rement gratuite, et pour lesquels il n'existe pas de\n   concurrence. La plupart des services publics demandant \u00e0\n   l'utilisateur une participation financi\u00e8re, ou \u00e9tant en\n   concurrence avec des entreprises priv\u00e9es, seules les fonctions\n   r\u00e9galiennes (police, justice, arm\u00e9e) ne seraient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es\n   comme publiques selon les crit\u00e8res de l'OMC.\n   Le 31 mars dernier s'est achev\u00e9 la seconde des trois phases de\n   ren\u00e9gociation de l'AGCS. A ce stade les \u00e9tats devaient\n   communiquer \u00e0 l'OMC la liste de tous les services qu'ils\n   souhaitent r\u00e9engager dans l'AGCS.\n\n  -L'\u00e9ducation et la sant\u00e9 faisaient partie l'ancien AGCS, elles\n   ne sont pour l'instant pas r\u00e9engag\u00e9es dans le nouvel AGCS. Par\n   contre, la d\u00e9finition m\u00eame de l'\u00e9ducation a chang\u00e9. Ne sera\n   consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9ducation que le cours en lui m\u00eame. Tout ce qui\n   tourne autour (Encadrement, Entretien des b\u00e2timents, restauration,\n   aide \u00e0 l'orientation, etc...) ne sera plus forc\u00e9ment consid\u00e9r\u00e9\n   comme de l'\u00e9ducation et pourra \u00eatre soumis aux conditions de\n   l'AGCS. Par exemple, dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9, les lits\n   d'h\u00f4pitaux ne sont plus consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme faisant partie du secteur\n   de la sant\u00e9, mais sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une prestation\n   d'h\u00f4tellerie et appartiennent au secteur \"Loisir et tourisme\".\n\n  -C'est ce qui se passe avec la vague de d\u00e9centralisation\n   que l'on conna\u00eet en ce moment. Si les professeurs ne perdent\n   pas leur statut de fonctionnaire, toutes les personnes tournant\n   autour (surveillants, agents d'entretient, conseillers\n   d'orientation, etc...) changent de statut, ce qui permettra\n   \u00e9ventuellement une ouverture de ce march\u00e9 au secteur priv\u00e9 \u00e0\n   terme.\n   Reste \u00e0 se demander si la vague de d\u00e9centralisation pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9e\n   que l'on conna\u00eet en ce moment est li\u00e9e au passage du cap du\n   31 mars dans la ren\u00e9gociation de l'AGCS.\n\n  L'AGCS concerne environ 140 pays. La derni\u00e8re phase de\n  n\u00e9gociation, au del\u00e0 de laquelle il ne sera plus possible\n  de revenir en arri\u00e8re, doit s'achever le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2004.\n  Nous vous invitons \u00e0 vous informer plus en d\u00e9tails sur l'AGCS.\n  Quelques sources, parmis d'autres:\n  http://france.attac.org/site/page.php?idpage=2301\n  http://forums.transnationale.org/viewtopic.php?p=2520\n  Vous pouvez aussi simplement lancer une recherche en tapant\n  \"AGCS\" sur Google.\n\n\nD\u00e9centralisation:\n  Les universit\u00e9s et leur personnel (IATOS), ainsi que Le personnel\n  des \u00e9tablissement du primaire et du secondaire ne seront plus\n  pay\u00e9s par l'\u00e9tat mais par les r\u00e9gions. Il en sera de m\u00eame pour\n  les Conseillers d'orientation, les psychologues, les infirmi\u00e8res\n  scolaires, les surveillants, et de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de tous ceux et\n  celles qui entourent les \u00e9l\u00e8ves... On peut craindre \u00e0 terme des\n  disparit\u00e9s entre les r\u00e9gions selon l'intensit\u00e9 de leur activit\u00e9\n  \u00e9conomique et leurs moyens. Le transfert de ces personnes aux\n  r\u00e9gions, pourra aussi faciliter une future privatisation.\n  Si cette mesure permettra de tenir la promesse \u00e9lectorale de\n  baisse des imp\u00f4ts nationaux, les imp\u00f4ts locaux, beaucoup moins\n  \u00e9galitaires, augmenteront en contrepartie... Par exemple, dans\n  la r\u00e9gion Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es la d\u00e9centralisation entra\u00eenera une hausse\n  de 20 \u00e0 30% des imp\u00f4ts.\n\n\nRemise en cause de la maternelle pour les 2 \u00e0 3 ans:\n  Pour beaucoup d'enfants (quand les deux parents travaillent par\n  exemple), la maternelle leur permet d'\u00eatre pris en charge dans\n  des conditions \u00e9gales.\n\n\nProfessionnalisation des cursus:\n  De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de plus en plus de jeunes sont envoy\u00e9s vers\n  les fili\u00e8res professionnelles. Si elles offrent un choix\n  alternatif \u00e0 ceux qui ne veulent pas suivre une formation\n  g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 montre que ce sont les jeunes ayant eu\n  des r\u00e9sultats insuffisants (souvent issus de milieux\n  d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s) qui y sont envoy\u00e9s.\n\n  On parle de remettre en cause le coll\u00e8ge unique. Cela signifie\n  la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre envoy\u00e9 vers un cycle court des l'entr\u00e9e\n  en sixi\u00e8me. N'est ce pas un peu t\u00f4t pour d\u00e9cider de l'avenir\n  d'un \u00e9l\u00e8ve?\n\n  Au lyc\u00e9e, le conseil d'administration pourra dor\u00e9navant \u00eatre\n  pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 soit par un \u00e9lu, soit par une personnalit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure\n  (membre de la chambre du commerce, chef d'entreprise...)\n  Pour ce qui est des universit\u00e9s, elles sont fortement\n  encourag\u00e9es \u00e0 rechercher des financements \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur, en\n  mettant en place des partenariats avec les entreprises locales,\n  en contrepartie de la mise en place de cursus adapt\u00e9s \u00e0\n  celles-ci. Ainsi naquit la licence \u00ab management de rayon \u00bb,\n  financ\u00e9e par Auchan, ou mieux, la licence \u00ab d\u00e9veloppement\n  durable \u00bb, financ\u00e9e par Total-Fina\n\n  A ce propos, il est important de revenir sur le pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 qui\n  veut qu'une formation professionnelle donnerait plus de chances\n  sur le march\u00e9 du travail qu'une formation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Une \u00e9tude\n  de l'INSEE a montr\u00e9 que pour une m\u00eame fili\u00e8re, les chances de\n  trouver un emploi \u00e9taient les m\u00eames que l'on ai un dipl\u00f4me\n  g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ou professionnalis\u00e9.\n\n\nR\u00e9duction et casse du statut des surveillants et aide \u00e9ducateurs:\n  25600 postes (5600 MI/SE, ou pions, et 20000 aides \u00e9ducateurs)\n  seront remplac\u00e9s par 16000 assistants d'\u00e9ducations. Le poste\n  de \u00ab pion \u00bb \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux \u00e9tudiants, sur crit\u00e8res sociaux.\n  Leurs horaires \u00e9tais \u00e9tablis en fonction de leur cours afin\n  qu'ils puissent suivre leur \u00e9tudes. Le nouveau statut est\n  ouvert \u00e0 tous, le texte mentionnant particuli\u00e8rement les\n  jeunes retrait\u00e9s et les m\u00e8res \u00ab au foyer \u00bb. Les horaires\n  pourront varier d'une semaine \u00e0 l'autre ce qui exclue les\n  \u00e9tudiant-e-s, qui ont des cours \u00e0 suivre...\n  Les jeunes des lyc\u00e9es et coll\u00e8ges seront donc entour\u00e9s par des\n  personnes moins nombreuses et moins jeunes.\n\n\nAutonomie des universit\u00e9s:\n  Elles disposeront dor\u00e9navant d'un budget global, que le\n  pr\u00e9sident devra g\u00e9rer et r\u00e9partir entre paye des personnels,\n  locaux, mat\u00e9riel, etc... Il est ainsi mis dans la position d'un\n  responsable d'entreprise publique. Le pr\u00e9sident ne sera\n  d'ailleurs plus obligatoirement un professeur appartenant \u00e0\n  l'universit\u00e9, mais pourra \u00eatre une tierce personne, choisie\n  pour ses qualit\u00e9s de gestionnaire.\n  Un \u00ab conseil d'orientation strat\u00e9gique \u00bb, compos\u00e9 de personnes\n  issues du milieu \u00e9conomique local, influera sur le conseil\n  d'administration, aura un droit de regard sur le pr\u00e9sident et\n  \u00e9mettra son avis lors de son \u00e9lection.\n  (voir: Professionnalisation des cursus)\n\n\nEncouragement des universit\u00e9s \u00e0 augmenter leur frais\nd'inscription:\n  \"Il faut sans doute r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 une responsabilisation des\n  \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 travers un lien financier plus fort avec leurs\n  \u00e9tablissements\" (B. Belloc, pr\u00e9sident de la Conf\u00e9rence des\n  Pr\u00e9sidents d'Universit\u00e9, 19/04/2001). En Europe, il faut\n  compter en moyenne 1200 euros par an pour aller \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9.\n  En France, un IUP pilote demande 4000 euro par an.\n\n\nD\u00e9sengagement financier de l'\u00e9tat:\n  Le budget de l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur 2004 annonce une baisse\n  de 158M d'euros. Un certain nombre d'universit\u00e9s sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien\n  en de\u00e7\u00e0 des conditions de fonctionnement (nombre de profs en\n  dessous du quota minimal, cessation de paiement, obligation de\n  suspension des activit\u00e9s p\u00e9dagogiques pendant quelques semaines\n  faute de moyens...). Le budget de la recherche publique, quand \u00e0\n  lui, baissera de 30%.\n\n\nDepuis quelques temps la conception m\u00eame qu'on nous donne du but\nde l'enseignement change:\nD'une instance assurant gratuitement la transmission des savoirs\nau plus grand nombre, on introduit peu \u00e0 peu l'id\u00e9e d'une \u00e9cole\net d'un savoir qui doivent \u00eatre rentables.

Que fera un tel syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif des\nenfants en difficult\u00e9?\nR\u00e9cemment, notre ministre Luc Ferry a remis en cause dans sa\n\u00ab lettre \u00e0 tous ceux qui aiment l'\u00e9cole \u00bb le principe de\n\u00ab l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve au coeur du syst\u00e8me \u00bb, pour retourner vers un syst\u00e8me\no\u00f9 le savoir serait au centre, et o\u00f9 l'\u00e9l\u00e8ve aurait \u00e0 s'adapter\nau syst\u00e8me au lieu que le syst\u00e8me s'adapte \u00e0 lui. (la sociologie\na d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la facilit\u00e9 qu'a un \u00e9l\u00e8ve de s'adapter au syst\u00e8me\nscolaire d\u00e9pend fortement de son milieu social d'origine)\n\nL'\u00e9cole n'est pas la seule \u00e0 \u00eatre touch\u00e9e par ce mouvement de\nrentabilisation et de privatisation.

However,\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\n\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\n\nI'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\nto one of these before either. One day though,\nsomething just said: \"You throw away $25.00 going to\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.\"\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those \"feelings\"\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling.\n\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\ndoing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.\nIt is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying\nand selling something of value.\n\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:\n\nMaking over half a million dollars every 4 to 5\nmonths from your home.\n\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!\n==================================================\nBE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!\n\nBefore you say \"Bull\", please read the following.\nThis is the letter you have been hearing about on the\nnews lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\nnot the program was legal.\n\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\n\"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\nthe program and if people can 'follow the simple\ninstructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost\".\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\nBETTER THAN EVER.\n\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"\n\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\n==================================================\nAnother said: \"This program has been around for a\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again.

After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this\nadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the\nperson in REPORT # 5.

Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.\n\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address\nACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.\n\n==================================================\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\n\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\nventure going:\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n==================================================\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\nresponse (the response could be much better but let's\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\n5,000 each.\n\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\nresponded with orders. That's 100 people who\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\n(half a million dollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\n==================================================\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\ne-mails each or more?\n\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\njust that, and more!\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\n\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\nthe report.\n\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\nit before it gets to you.\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\nname and postal address.\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\n==================================================\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider's Guide To Advertising\nfor Free On The Net\"\n\nOrder Report #1 from:\n\nRMN\nLindkenshoferweg 50\n45279 Essen\nGermany\n\n\n\n\nREPORT # 2: \"The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk\nEmail On The Net\"\n\nOrder Report # 2 from:\n\nM.T.\nPO Box 125\nPenarth\nCF64 5ZY\nUnited Kingdom\n\n\n\n\nREPORT # 3: \"Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net\"\n\nOrder Report # 3 from:\n\nY.

Box 42153\nCanada Post Centre Plaza\n128 Queen St. S\nMississauga, Ontario\nL5M4Z0\nCanada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORT # 5: \"How To Send Out One Million Emails\nFor Free\"\n\nOrder Report # 5 From:\n\nJ.C.\nPO 43201\n325 Central Parkway West\nMississauga, Ontario, Canada\nL5B 4A7\n\n\n\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for\nReport #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails\nuntil you do.\n\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks\nafter that you should receive 100 orders or more for\nREPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or\nsending e-mails until you do.\n\n** Once you have received 100 or more orders for\nReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is\nalready working for you, and the cash will continue\nto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\nin front of a different report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\n=================================================\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\nYou have just received information that can give you\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with\nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can\nmake more money in the next few weeks and months\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\n\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\nafter you have put your name and address in\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\nname will be on every one of them.\n\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\n\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\n\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\nreceiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\nand percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\n'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.\n\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.\"\n\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n================================================\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\nthat I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.\n\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\nmatter where people live. There simply isn't a\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\n\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n=================================================\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\n\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n=================================================\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\n\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\n=================================================\n\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\n\n=================================================\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\n\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618.\n\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\nof our technical ability.\n\nxknjglxbvrnajpicfiyhkiiciowcrhgixw\n\nctckofojodiuutnmufpt\n\n\nscgskhvacunqjfcwdltqxdi\n\n\n"

If you sign up on this site, you can stop a\nll those telemarketing calls forever.  Just put your phone numbers and email ad\ndress into the site and stop those calls forever.\n\nThe second is www.myfutureisnow.com\n\nThe government also passed the deregulation law where normal people can get pai\nd on peoples gas, electric, phone and internet bills.  This site has allowed my\n family to live a life-style I never imagined.  Working out of my home and earn\ning an income that put us among the top 1% of income earners worldwide.\n\nI wanted to share this site with you so that you could do the same for you and\nyour family.  You deserve it.  Enjoy the sites and we'll see you at the top.\n\n\n"

Ironically, most of\nthe countries with widely deployed software that violates the standards by\nemitting unlabelled charsets use encodings that are very easy to\ndistinguish from UTF-8.\n\n(3) The UTF-8 overlong sequence issue is sufficiently well documented that\nany security problems in practice are the result of buggy code.

UTF-8-based s\noftware also used to\nassume that supplementary code points would never occur, and used to hardcode t\nhat assumption with\n16-bit wchar_t and 16-bit-indexed character lookups. Despite UTF-8's design, a\nlot of UTF-8 software\nwrongly encoded supplementary code points (by encoding surrogate pairs instead)\n, wrongly decoded\nthem (many decoders truncated code points to the lower 16 bits - visible in sev\neral popular\nbrowsers, until very recently at least), and failed to look up properties for s\nupplementary code\npoints. Code paths for dealing with supplementary characters were tested as lit\ntle with UTF-8 as\nthey were with UTF-16.\n\n> Unfortunately, I'm afraid the majority of software will fall in the\n> latter two categories.\n\nRegardless of UTF. On the other hand, writers of low-level Unicode libraries ha\nve spent time over\nthe last several years testing and upgrading their code. For example, ICU fully\n handles\nsupplementary code points, using UTF-16 - in both C/C++ and Java.\n\nBest regards,\nmarkus\n\n--\nOpinions expressed here may not reflect my company's positions unless otherwise\n noted.\n\n\n"

(If users dink with the message headers themselves,\nall bets are off.)\n\n> Should the Pine developers remove this feature?\n\nI'm not sure what the feature in question is, but if it's\nsomething which lets users specify the value to be sent out as the\nMIME Content-Type: charset, I think it's a bad idea, and should be\nremoved or significantly altered.\n\nAn easy mistake to make (I speak from experience) is to assume\nthat the charset parameter on a MIME Content-Type: line encodes\nthe character set used by the entity composing the message, or\nthe character set to be used by the entity displaying the\nmessage. I find that the best way to think about charset is that\nit is *neither*.  charset is an octet-based encoding used during\nmessage transfer; it need bear no relation to the composing or\nviewing character sets.  In the most general case, a message will\nbe composed using some native character set, translated\nautomatically to a MIME-registered charset, and translated at the\nother end into a native display character set.  It should be more\nlikely that the charset value be selected by an automaton, not by\na human.\n\n(If anyone finds the above paragraph startling, you're welcome to\nwrite to me for clarification.  I'm not going to prolong this\nmessage with additional explanations right now.)\n\nIt's not necessarily *wrong* to think of charset as having\nsomething to do with the composing or viewing character set (in\nmany cases, not coincidentally, all three will be identical), but\nit is very easy to make conceptual mistakes, implement\nnonconformant software, or just generally misunderstand how MIME\nis supposed to work if you don't explicitly separate in your mind\nthe concepts of composing/viewing character sets and transmission\ncharsets.  (You'll notice that I reinforce this distinction in my\nown head and in this message by using the terms \"character set\"\nand \"charset\" noninterchangeably.)\n\nThe charset situation is much like the canonical CRLF situation:\nthe fact that the canonical representation is identical to some\nbut not all of the available local representations guarantees\nmisunderstandings.\n\nTo be sure, automated selection of and translation to a registered\nMIME charset is a non-trivial task, and mailers which are trying\nto adopt MIME right away cannot be faulted for deferring\ndevelopment of such functionality for a while.  However, just\nletting users specify non-default, non-7-bit-US-ASCII, (non-MIME)\ncharsets is an open invitation to misunderstanding and\nnoninteroperability.\n\nFor now, composition agents which wish to allow users to use\nextended character sets (such as Latin-1), but which elect to\nrelegate character set and/or charset selection to the user,\nshould either present the user with a menu of registered MIME\ncharsets from which to select (presumably it will be up to the\nuser to ensure that the editor or composition tool is actually\nusing a character set corresponding to the selected charset), or\n(in the case of what it sounds like PINE is doing) at least filter\nthe user's open-ended charset selection against the list of\nregistered values (and perhaps also the X- pattern).\n\nI've copied this message to the IETF character sets mailing list\n(ietf-charsets@innosoft.com, subscription requests to\nietf-charsets-request@innosoft.com); any followup traffic should\nbe sent there, and *not* to the ietf-822 list.\n\n                                        Steve Summit\n                                        scs@adam.mit.edu\n\nP.S. to pine-info@cac.washington.edu: despite my e-mail address,\nI'm actually in Seattle, near UW.

I maintain that CHARSET specification should be\nomitted when feasible.   This is because there are such things as\ngateways which translate the SMTP octet-stream into anything.\n\n        There are two goals:  1)  to be able to specify new and/or\nextended character sets  (and mark-ups and other extensions to plain text)\nand  2)  to use  \"plain text\"  (in mail)  as a transport medium.\nFor the former,  use  Base64  encoding when needed.   For the latter,\ndon't label the text  \"ASCII\"  or any other codepoint mapping if there's\nany way on earth that it might get translated by a gateway.\n\n        I don't think this is making sense and I can't find the words.\nSteve apparently has:   charset -vs- character_set.\n\n        Plain text  is defined differently from system to system.\nOn UNIX,  plain text is ASCII (now ISO-8859-1) with lines delimited by\nNL (actually LF).

(memory is cheap)\nOn VM/CMS,  plain text is EBCDIC (now CodePage 1047) and records are\nhandled by the filesystem out-of-band of the data,  so NL (and LF and CR)\naren't sacred characters.

That's why I ask that\n(today,  1993)  we  NOT LABEL  true plain text as  US-ASCII/ISO-8859-1.\nJust leave it alone and let it default at the receiving end.\n\n>                                    and mailers which are trying\n>to adopt MIME right away cannot be faulted for deferring\n>development of such functionality for a while.\n\n        And let me reiterate that I'm not mad at the Pine developers\n(nor the MIME developers;  not mad at anyone,  just trying to push a\npoint that I think is important and has been missed).

            "content": "Rick, et al.,\n\nI've been pretty quiet on this one.  Frankly, I've been hoping that it\nwould burn itself out.  But it doesn't seem to be doing that.  So let's\ngo back and review a couple of things.   I'm posting this to the 822\nlist, since most of the issues are really MIME ones, not character set\nones, and to the charset list because that is where you posted your\nnote.  Everyone else has been removed.  People who are already throughly\nsick of this discussion should stop reading here.\n\n(1) MIME, like every single other Internet protocol at or near the\napplications layer, describes \"on the wire\" behavior.  Neither it, nor\nany of the others, describes what should be one on a particular machine\nonce things arrive there beyond hints about what other systems might\nexpect vis-a-vis things that are going back out on the wire.  The way\nyou _represent_ a MIME message on your host and in your UA <->user and\nUA <-> MTA communications is not the subject of Internet protocols, even\nthough ease of use with those protocols may influence whether some\ndecisions are as smart, or smarter, than others.\n   In particular, once something gets to your machine, you can dissect\nthe headers and store them separately in some unique-to-you canonical\nform and report whatever you please to your users.  You can also store\nthe characters in 17-bit reverse-slobbovian notation for all anyone\ncares.  The only requirement--of MIME or anything else--is that you be\nable to reconstruct network-canonical form (e.g., MIME) if you send the\nstuff back out.\n\n(2) MIME defines text/plain in the absense of an explicit charset\nindicator to be identical to \"text/plain; charset=ascii\".  This didn't\nhappen by accident: it was discussed at tedious and exhaustive length.\nIt turned out to be the only option: any other model would have caused a\nviolation of RFC822 with potential information-loss.  There was fairly\ngeneral agreement in the WG that breaking RFC822-conforming\nimplementations was a terrible idea.\n   To claim that it is better to write text/plain without a charset\nparameter than with one is justified under only two circumstances that I\ncan think of:\n    -- you intend to violate the protocols and hope that, if the charset\nparameter isn't listed, no one will notice.\n    -- you have gotten confused, not about a \"charset\" versus\n\"character_set\" issue, but about the difference between an on-the-wire\nmail format protocol specification and a user-level notion of reality on\na particular terminal at a particular time.\n\nIf looking at \"charset=us-ascii\" is offensive to you, take it out at\ndisplay time in your UA, just as many of us hide Received lines unless/\nuntil we need them for something.  Whether you just hide that string, or\nreplace it with \"charset=Plutoian-666\" is really not an issue for the\nnetwork.\n\n(3)  For similar reasons, ISO-8859-1 can't be unqualified text/plain on\nthe wire; it would violate RFC822 and unextended RFC821.  And, just\nincidentally, it would trade an \"English exclusive\" mail environment for\na \"Western European Latin-based language\" primary mail environment.\nThat wasn't considered to be enough gain to be worth the trouble.  Maybe\nthat was a wrong decision, but I don't think so.   Note that trading\n\"ISO-8859-1\" (an assertion about coding of characters on the wire) for\n\"Latin-1\" (an abstraction about a particular character repertoire)\ndoesn't help with this problem--one is as Western European as the\nother-- it just costs you knowledge of the coding on the wire.\n\n(4) There is another major piece of confusion associated with the\nassumption that BITNET MAIL is RFC822-conforming.  It isn't now.  It\nnever has been.   RFC822-Mail over NJE is an oxymoron.   RFC822 messages\nare in ASCII.  It is useful sometimes to pretend that there is a virtual\ndocument, let's call it B-822, that defines the format of BITNET mail.\nIt contains two lines.  One says \"On BITNET, we use EBCDIC where RFC822\nuses ASCII\" and the second one says \"except for the changes implied by\nline 1, RFC822 is incorporated here by reference\".  Now BITNET seems to\nbe (gradually and without complete agreement) issuing B-822bis, which\nchanges \"EBCDIC\" in that first line to \"EBCDIC CodePage 1047\".  B-822bis\nstill isn't RFC822.\n\nAnd, since the MIME of RFC1341bis/RFC1342bis requires RFC822, BITNET\nisn't using it unless all of the headers (822 and body-part) are in\nASCII.  That is a firm requirement, no amount of fussing with \"charset\"\nchanges it.\n\nSo, there is a very interesting question about what the gateways should\ndo and what near-MIME should look like in a near-RFC822 environment.\nBut it isn't really a MIME question, much less a charset question.  See\nitem 6, below.\n\n(5) Now, there is something that could have been done back when the WG\nwas making its decisions that would have made the work of the gateways\nbetween RFC822-based mail and B-822-based mail much easier, although it\nwould have required changes in those gateways.   We could have decided\nthat this was a transport problem, that we should extend SMTP to\nannounce, in some fashion, \"here comes the MIME\" or \"here comes the\ncharset XXX\".  If the receiving SMTP in this situation didn't accept\nthat assertion, the mail would bounce.  But it would be immediately\nclear which gateways were able to cope in a useful way, and which ones\ncouldn't.  And it would make it relatively easy to establish a\nB-1341bis/B-1342bis that used different \"charset\" conventions if that\nwas appropriate.   The cost would have been that all of the MTAs would\nhave had to be changed to implement MIME.\n\nThose who have been putting up with this long enough will recall that I\nargued fairly strongly for transport involvement in this process.  The\nproblems, and semantic unpleasantnesses, that Rick is concerned about\nnow were most of my motivation then.   Given the engineering tradeoffs\nbetween making things easier for some gateways and a little safe overall\nversus speed of deployment, I was probably wrong.  I was certainly\nsoundly outvoted.\n\n(6) Ok, now what should be done with \"MIME\" over B-822?  There are a\ncouple of realistic possibilities.  There are also a bunch of\nunrealistic ones that depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on getting\nagreement from every gateway and every host that sits on an\nInternet/EBCDIC boundary to either bounce MIME messages or handle them\nin the same specific way.  I don't think those are worth discussing now,\nalthough maybe it is too bad that we didn't try to deploy MIME when the\nnumber of gateways and hosts in this situation was closer to three than\na few hundred.\n\n  (i) You can let the gateways keep blindly converting everything that\nthey get from the Internet into EBCDIC, as they are doing now.  If you\ndo this, you need to extend the first sentence of B-822 to say that\nanytime \"us-ascii\" is seen in a message, it means \"ebcdic\".  In this\nscenario, you don't teach the gateways to accept 8bit traffic.  If that\nmeans you end up with a lot of quoted-printable stuff and base64 stuff,\nthat is just the way it goes.  Fix it in the receiving UAs if they\nrecognize the MIME value of the \"charset\" parameter.  If not, life is no\nworse for them than for real MIME UAs.\n\n  (ii) You can do the above, but let the gateways access 8bit traffic.\nThis means that they have to be a little more activist about potential\nconversions.  They might want to convert ISO-8859-1 to an appropriate\nLatin-1-oriented EBCDIC.  I strongly recommend that they identify that\nthey have done this with a new header that they filter on the way in and\nout.  That header has to do with which EBCDIC is being used, presumably\nwith CodePage 1047 as the default.  If you don't do that, you are going\nto be in deep trouble when Latin-2 (much less ideographic character sets\nand non-Latin-based ones) arrives.  Remember that there are EARN sites\nin Poland and Hungary and Russia and Turkey.  It won't take long and\nthen BITNET will have an EBCDIC-labelling problem even if there were no\nMIME.\n\n   (iii) You can teach the smarter gateways to put a new verb into the\nBMSTP for sites that want it that identifies unconverted MIME and then\npass the message exactly as received by the gateway (e.g., no character\nconversion).  This would move the conversion problem away from the\ngateways and to the delivery MTAs and UAs, which may be able to do\nsmarter things for their users.  This would work well for smart gateways\ntalking to smart sites.  It might be rational to assume that the others\nfall under (i) above, i.e., they are on their own and they are going to\nsee some things encoded that don't strictly need to be.  As the saying\ngoes, life is hard sometimes.\n\n(7) There are a couple of other things in your note that are invitations\nto interoperability problems.  For example...\n>Specifically,  I feel\n>(quite strongly)  that the user should be able to specify any old\n>charset and have display at least attempted at the other end.\n    I feel (quite strongly) that this falls between \"looking for\ntrouble\" and a potential real disaster.   Suppose you receive\n\"text/plain; charset=Mickey-Mouse\".  What is the recipient going to try\nto display?  We made the mistake with RFC822 of permitting people to put\nanything in, subject only to the rule that we might later come along and\nassign some semantics to it.  That means that message structures that\nhad a specific meaning a half-dozen years ago now may have a different\nmeaning, with no real clues to anyone.  Bad mistake.  If a user wants to\nuse \"any old charset\", use an \"X-\" as a warning that there had better be\na private agreement between sender and receiver.  If the \"X-\" is\noffensive, let it be defined and registered so that there is some hope\nthat \"attempting display\" will get it right.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n>If you specify  \"Latin-1\",  then you can  (must;  I'm arguing for a\n>definition here,  not an explanation)  assume that  SMTP  will carry it\n>as ISO-8859-1,  BUT THE RECEIVING  (or sending)  HOST MIGHT NOT.\n>(and yes,  sad but true,  any SMTPs will strip the high bit)\n  If you specify \"Latin-1\", then you cannot make any assumptions at all\nabout how SMTP will carry it.  \"Latin-1\" is an ambiguous reference, one\nof whose instantiations of ISO 8859-1.  If you specify \"iso-8859-1\",\ntogether with a content-transfer-encoding, you know exactly what is\nbeing carried on the wire.  In neither case is any assertion made about\nwhat the receiving host might do with it.  That is a MTA-delivery-UA\nproblem, not a MIME/822/821/etc one.\n\nAnd\n>That's why I ask that\n>(today,  1993)  we  NOT LABEL  true plain text as  US-ASCII/ISO-8859-1.\n>Just leave it alone and let it default at the receiving end.\n  Get into your time machine.  Go back to 1981 or 82.  Make this case\nthen.  In \"today, 1981\" we labelled true plain text as ANS X3.4 ASCII.\nWe put the label in the protocol document, not in the mail messages, but\nthe specification is clear, was clear, and will still be clear when your\ntime machine gets back to 1993.\n\n>(nor the MIME developers;  not mad at anyone,  just trying to push a\n>point that I think is important and has been missed).\n\n  For whatever my assurances are worth, it hasn't been missed.  The\nquestions and options were examined very carefully; nothing above is\nreally new.   What is missing, I fear, is an understanding of what has\nbeen going on with email for the last decade.\n\n  There is a dirty little secret that many of us have known, or feared,\nfor many years and that, for better or worse, MIME and the SMTP\nextensions have brought to the foreground.  The mail environment has\nworked for the last decade not because of a high level of conformance or\nunderstanding of subtle aspects of the protocols but because of a very\nhigh level of robustness and tolerance for nonsense.  Protocol changes\nand extensions almost inevitably raise the conformance threshold and the\nunderstanding threshold along with it.  And we are shaking out a lot of\nbeliefs that are handy but not quite true, e.g., the one that assumes\nthat BITNET uses RFC822 on NJE-wires.  It has never been true, but\nbelieving it up until recently hasn't been harmful.  Well, it is getting\nharmful and that is one of the prices we pay for MIME.\n\n    john\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

In many parts of the world it is\nseen as essential for the success of the global services that they should be\nable to recognize, store, and present textual information like personal and\norganizational names, represented in the character sets used by those\nconcerned. This means that the Directory must be able to handle national\ncharacters not found in the US-ASCII repetoire.  The same applies to the other\nglobal information services on the network (e.g the data bases used in many\ninformation servers). This is especially a problem as information services are\nprovided for clients on various difference hardware architectures.\n\nCurrently, for the Western European languages at least 5 different encodings\nare in use on the network: ISO-7 National Variants, ISO 8859/1, ROMAN8, T.61,\nand RC850. (See RFC1345 for further information on these character sets.) If we\nconsider the other scripts used in Europe and the other encodings the number of\ndifferent charater set codes rise to as many as 40. This is the real (and\nmessy) world we live in.  Changing the character sets in this world is not an\noption, as current systems run applications which can support only the\ncharacter sets used by that system.\n\nHowever, a universal encoding has begun to appear: UCS (ISO 10646). Initial\nexperience with this solution has been positive. However, there are still\nmany issued to be addressed in the context of ISO 10 646 and the other\ncharacter set codes, which will exist on the Internet in the future:\n\n\n(1) Can we agree on some common network services/model for character set\n   handling?\n\n(2) Should a general-purpose SW tool be designed that will support both\n    UCS and regional character sets?\n\n(3) Is there a solution that will make character set convertors for diffrent\n    codes \"plug-and-play\" (i.e. an API) without specifying the actual\n    underlying implementation? Can we use UCS as a common denominator for that?\n\n(4) Is it necessary to have a document identifying the language and the\n    character sets which cater for particular language?\n\n(5) If we need to solve these problems and UCS (ISO 10 646)  is the\n    only available general option today which is maybe close to be\n    sufficient,  can we  start with UCS and make minimal\n    changes or specifications which will be sufficient for our needs.

What are the \"sender\" and\n    \"recipient\"      on the Internet? Can we define a mechanism to\n    identify the serialized     byte order of a data stream?\n\n(5.2) Additional encoding mechanisms for the UCS have been proposed.

It is just terse. The ideas are\nbased on experience. They have been put to use in the field of 8-bit\ncharacters. I participated to the design of Kermit multinational 8-bit\ncharacters support and the TCP/IP network I work for is well on the way\ntowards the the same theory that every character on the communication\nline is ISO 8859-1. Any exception to this, like translating EBCDIC directly\nto PC code on one machine, is considered harmful to our internetworking,\neven if convenient.\nEvery piece working towards a common well defined goal finally pays more\nwhen all parts start to clutch than wandering for immediate interest.\nAnd I hope that saying that my language is French will make the ideas\nin a difficult to write text even more convincing, despite being short.\n\nNetworking has had for long the problem of a common representation of\ncomputer-specific data (numbers, bit strings...) on the wire (rather, on the\nconnection), because different computers had different conventions for them.\nTo solve this problem, rules like XDR (external data representation) have\nbeen devised, and, because it was so important, the rules have been adopted.\n\nCharacter data caused little problem because ASCII was assumed, full stop.\nThere was hardly an expressed rule. It was tacit computer culture.\n\nNow that networking reaches its real dimension of an international mesh,\nthe problem of national languages usage becomes very real, at least locally,\nbut more and more internationally. Any computer has to exchange more\nthan ASCII.\nMany generous people have spent much time to have system Si with character\ncode Ci translate data for system Sj with code Cj under protocol Pk.\nWith much respect for their work, this is not (no longer) the way to do it.\nSupposing that N character codes exist on different systems, the effort\namounts to M*N**2 to reach a complete solution. Let us count the different\ncharacter codes (IBM have their share) and protocols, the bill is amazing!\n\nThe _most_important_point_ is that a single common representation code\nbe defined _for_the_line_ (suiting the purpose, namely to cover all national\nlanguages in one single way) and that people be instructed that every bit\nof text should travel in that code on the wire, whatever_the_protocol_is.\n(Meaning that common tools be available to translate present local code).\nIt is best for a computer to use the code of interchange internally,\nbut all computers in the world cannot be modified overnight.\nWhat computer Si has to do to abide by the external representation is\nthe sole matter of computer Si: to appear to others as if it were using\nit internally. On any protocol the same way, even during dialog with\ncomputer Ti using the same code (\"One need not know which kind of system\none is sending mail to\"). No tagging of the data nor any need to know\nany character code other than one's own and the interchange code.\nThe M*N**2 order of magnitude reduces to N.\nThis is the extended \"ASCII culture\" of some future, no doubt.\nIt is a very important goal just now.\nIt is a fact that the choice of a character code has long lasting effects,\nbecause of the building software base. The impact of today's decisions\nis amplified by time. The sooner the better. The better the sooner.\n\nMore theoretically said this time, this local-code to exchange-code\ntranslation works much a la OSI layer (or \"a` la\", if you don't mind :-)\nData is encoded towards a lower layer, exchanged, and decoded back to\nsame level, but possibly to a different local code.\nIt probably belongs between level 6 and 7, as it could prove that the\napplication layer provides all the textual data. But that's not sure,\nlike for XDR which can be used from many levels to convert CPU data\nto line format.\nShould we merge \"presentation\" and \"representation\" layers, split level 6\nlike level 2 or not assign it to any level, I'll leave the discussion to\nthe theoricians.\n\nWhat seems clear in my mind is that the translation is not in several\nfinal protocols, but a protocol by itself -- like XDR -- that other\nprotocols refer to.\nAnd this may be the most important point.\nIt is a pity to see each protocol tackle the problem its own way.\n\nNote that the \"level 6 or so\" concept applied to text extends slightly beyond\nthe representation of characters (and binary data) towards file structure.\nThink of the line separator problem of NFS for the basic case of text files.\nWhile file structure (including file name etc...) is clearly a specialized\nproblem (as opposed to communication of streams of text), the impact on\nsystems and protocols design is just as high.\n\nClearly, it will take much time to stand in ASCII's shoes.\nBut doing otherwise would take even longer to erase and redo.\nOne cannot increase complication eternally.\n\nSome intermediate compromises will have to be used like additional\nencoding on pathes some insist to not even try to convert to 8-bit,\nasking the rest of the networks to convert to 7-bit instead and to\nrewrite all their programs to use a complicated method for sending\nplain text when the sole problem is that it contains 8-bit data.\n\nThe important thing is that the new layer be known and used.\nIt's the interest of both the software writer and buyer.\nIt will get void when a system will use the interchange code for itself.\n\nNow that the international character code ISO 10646 is out, isn't it time\nfor communication systems to be able to not only exchange pictures and sound\nbut also plain text?  Will ISO 10646 be used by OSI 6?\n\nThanks for your interest.\nI go away for holidays today.

There seemed to be consensus among the participants that going with\nan UTF-2 like encoding of ISO 10646 would be preferable, but there were\nalso some points raised:\n\n        * UTF-2 character encodings rapidly grow with the character\n          code, which is not an issue for European use but might\n          be for Asian use or for groups or planes to be defined by ISO,\n          depending on their placement in the 10646 coding space.\n\n        * 10646 does not include all characters that are in widespread use.\n\n        * The CJK unification is not endorsed by everyone.\n\nKeith Moore raised the question wether we could extend ISO 10464, perhaps\nmaking use of groups, planes or zones reserved for private use.\nJohn Klensin then pointed out that ISO has a long history of retracting\nsuch reservations, at which point the Internet would then have a severe\nproblem. Thus, extending 10646 does not seem the way to go.\n\nThere is a different route, however. The UTF-2 encoding, even when\nextended to 32 bits like X/Open has proposed, has unused octet\nsequences, and it is possible to make use of this in a way that is\ncompatible with other UTF-2 systems. The remainder of this message\nenumerates the available coding options for UTF-2 extensions and\nsuggests some possible uses of the available coding space.\n\nThe UTF-2 encoding\n\nFirst I introduce the UTF-2 encoding and my understanding of the\nproposed X/Open extension to 32 bits. Since I do not have definitive\nreferences on the latter, I may be wrong in minor details, but this\nshould not effect the basic principles of the method. See the references\nin my earlier posting to find out more about the history and motivation\nof UTF-2.\n\nThe extended UTF-2 encoding is essentially a way of coding 32-bit codes into\nvariable length octet sequences. In practice, the 32-bit codes represent\ncharacters from ISO 10646. I use the following definitions (inspired by\nthe rune.c file from the Plan 9 text editor, Sam):\n\n        T0 = 0xxxxxxx\n        Tx = 10xxxxxx\n        T1 = 110xxxxx\n        T2 = 1110xxxx\n        T3 = 11110xxx\n        T4 = 111110xx\n        T5 = 111111xx\n\nOctet sequences representing a single 32-bit code consist of one of the\nTn codes, were n is 0 to 5, followed by n Tx codes (one may think of\n\"x\" as \"extension\").\n\nThe correspondence between 32-bit codes and octet sequences is as\nfollows:\n\n T0:    00000000 00000000 00000000 0bbbbbbb\n\n   <->  0bbbbbbb\n\n\n T1:    00000000 00000000 00000bbb bbbbbbbbb\n        \n   <->  110bbbbb 10bbbbbb\n        \n\n T2:    00000000 00000000 bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbb\n\n   <->  1110bbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb\n\n\n T3:    00000000 000bbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbb\n\n   <->  11110bbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb\n\n\n T4:    000000bb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbb\n\n   <->  111110bb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb\n\n\n T5:    bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbbbb\n\n   <->  111111bb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb\n\nIf a 32-bit code can be represented by multiple octet sequences,\nthe shortest one is chosen. This is actually a Plan 9 requirement,\nand X/Open may have relaxed it. This is not fatal, however.\n\nFree coding space\n\nAt first sight, it would appear that all possible octet sequences are\ntaken. This is not the case, however. For a given 32-bit code,\nit is required that the shortest sequence be used. This frees up coding\nspace in the next longer sequence: it cannot have all zeroes in the bit\npositions not covered by the next shorter sequence.\n\nThus, assuming we want to keep the length properties, the free coding space is\n\n T1':   1100000x 10xxxxxx\n\n T2':   11100000 100xxxxx 10xxxxxx\n\n T3':   11110000 1000xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n\n T4':   11111000 10000xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n\n T5':   11111100 100000xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n        \nIt is however not a good idea to use these exact sequences. The reason\nis that an UTF-2 implementation may not check that the leading bits are\nin fact non-zero (and indeed the Plan 9 implementation does not do this),\nwhich would cause our extended codes to be mistakenly interpreted as\nvalid 32-bit codes. However, a robust implementation will check that\nthe extension octets are in fact Tx octets. We can exploit this by\nusing a different number of Tx octets, which UTF-2 implementation should\ndiagnose as a bad octet sequence. If we use a larger number, this may\nnot be diagnosed until the next sequence is decoded and this is\nundesirable. Thus, we restrict ourselves to a smaller number of Tx\noctets. This also has the desirable property that an extension sequence\nshould result in a single \"bad\" code for UTF-2 implementations.\nThe newly available sequences are then\n\n T1'0:  1100000x\n\n T2'1:  11100000 100xxxxx\n\n T3'1:  11110000 1000xxxx\n T3'2:  11110000 1000xxxx 10xxxxxx\n\n T4'1:  11111000 10000xxx\n T4'2:  11111000 10000xxx 10xxxxxx\n T4'3:  11111000 10000xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n\n T5'1:  11111100 100000xx\n T5'2:  11111100 100000xx 10xxxxxx\n T5'3:  11111100 100000xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n T5'4:  11111100 100000xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n\nprovided that we use them in such a way that the length can be\ndetermined from the sequence itself. Thus, we have freed\n\n        2^1 +\n        2^5 +\n        2^4 + 2^10 +\n        2^3 + 2^9 + 2^15 +\n        2^2 + 2^8 + 2^14 + 2^20\n     =\n        2 +\n        32 +\n        16 + 1024 +\n        8 + 512 + 32768 +\n        4 + 256 + 16384 + 1048576\n     =\n        1099582\n\ncoding sequences (a little more then 2^20).\n\nAlthough it is possible to use non-Tx extension octets as well, this\ndestroys some of the nice properties of the UTF-2 encoding. In particular,\nit complicates the algorithms for skipping code sequences and recognizing\nthe start of such sequences. Even the present modification destroys the\nproperty that the length can be determined from the first byte, but\nit is possible to choose the encoding in such a way that incomplete\noctet sequences can be distinguished from complete sequences without\nreferring to octets that are not part of the sequence.\n\nUse of the new coding space\n\nThere are various ways to use this coding space, each of them\ncompensating some disadvantages of the \"plain\" UTF-2 10646 encoding.\n\nFor example, one way to use the new coding space is to allow reference to\nevery ECMA-registered character set, by coding the character set\nreference together with the character. The T4'3 and T5'3 sequences are\nideal for 94^1 or 96^1 character sets, since they have just enough\nbits. Often used ECMA sets could be given shorter sequences, by recoding\nthe character set reference. The T5'4 sequence is not able to code all\nforeseeable 94^2 or 96^2 character sets, since it has only 6 bits\navailable for the character set reference. It should be more then enough,\nhowever, for the currently registered ones (I suspect there are far less\nthan 64 94^2 or 96^2 sets registered). Note that this technique does not\nuse up all of the T4'3 and T5'3 coding space; character set references\nalways have codes greater than 30 hexadecimal (3/0 in the ISO notation).\n\nOf course, characters that are part of the 10646 BMP should be coded\nusing the \"normal\" UTF-2 sequences, to avoid requiring enormous mapping\ntables in each implementation. This technique does provide an escape\nhatch from the CJK unification, however, for people who deem it\nnecessary.\n\nThe new coding space can also be used to efficiently code any future\nextensions to ISO 10646, by compact plane and/or group encoding\n(e.g. using sign extension and/or skipping zero bits). Since we\ndo not yet know what planes or groups these are going to be,\nwe cannot specify this mapping now. If we fix the length determination,\nhowever, current implementations will behave gracefully when such\nextensions are made. We could require implementation to make\nthe translation table-driven, so that future extensions are easy.\nThere are not that many bits available for this purpose, assuming\nwe are not going to do transformations on row/column values.\n\nFinally, note that there are 2 one-octet codes available. Does\nsomebody know an often-used character that is not in ISO 10646?\n\nThere is one desirable property that is lost by these techniques,\nwhich is that a character has only a single representation. It is\npreserved for the 10646 subset, however, and any extension\nwould have the same effect if extension characters are incorporated in\n10646 at some future date.\n\nImplementation\n\nAs with all Internet standards, we can only mandate \"on the wire\"\nbehaviour. However, it is useful to reflect somewhat on\nimplementation aspects of this scheme.\n\nAny implementation purporting to eventually support full ISO 10646\nmust use more then 32 bits to represent characters, since we have\nintroduced about 2^20 extra characters. Thus, 33 bits should be\nenough for most practical uses. How these bits are used is not\nparticularly important, but one could represent extension codes\nby storing the first octet in the high order bits, together with some\nindication of the total length, while all the x bits are stored in\nthe low order bits.\n\nThis presumes a stateless encoding, however. Translation to ISO 2022\nshould be easy, since ECMA has registered references for the ISO 10646\nset. Translation from ISO 2022 is more difficult, since ISO 10646\ncharacters must be represented as such; this may require translation\ntables in some cases. If such tables are not available, translation\nof the ASCII subset should be trivial and provides good fallback\nbehaviour.\n\nFor some applications, it would actually be preferable to keep the byte\nstream form, since this guarantees information preservation and is\nnot *that* inefficient; the overhead is at most 50% over any other\nstateless encoding. One such application that comes to mind is mail\nforwarding.\n\nApplications\n\nThis encoding should be suitable for most Internet protocols that\ncurrently use NET-ASCII, and it should be usable with the DNS as is,\nalthough there are some complications with regard to case transformation\n(the DNS is supposed to match domain names case-insensitive). This could\neasily be cured, however, by restricting the character set that may be\nused in domain names.\n\nOf course, most protocols would need some form of negotiation to make\nsure that both ends understand NET-TEXT as opposed to NET-ASCII.\nFor most implementations this would be a trivial addition, however;\nit mostly requires 8-bit transparance which is in general not difficult\nto achieve.\n\n--\nLuc Rooijakkers                                 Internet: lwj@cs.kun.nl\nSPC Group, the Netherlands                      UUCP: uunet!cs.kun.nl!lwj\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Any comments or corrections?\n\n1) Many existing protocols are evaluated how they adopt to the\nextended character sets.\n\n2) Whether\n        we should extend all the protocols so that they can negotiate\n        or announce the character set used\nor\n        we should provide a single universal encoding of text\nis the first issue. No one said the former is better and the discussion\ncontinued on how to implement the latter only.\n\n3) Assuming ISO 10646, whether we should use\n        16bit byte\nor\n        UTF style encoding\nis discussed. With brief explanation on the issue that\n        \"16bit byte\" is incompatible with the current ASCII files\n        and ASCII based protocols\nand that\n        \"16bit byte\" is an obstacle to 32bitness though ISO 10646\n        is now being extended beyond 16 bit\nno one said \"16bit byte\" anymore (though some might still silently\nthink \"16bit byte\" is the way to go).\n\n4) If we are to have a single universal text encoding, the encoding should\nbe good enough in every respect. Several requirements for the encoding\nwas presented by me.\n        Plain Text Processing\n                We should focus on the processing of plain text.\n        Universality\n                The encoding must be able to restore the original content\n                of a encoded plain text without any negotiation nor\n                profiling. This requirement is already stated in 2).\n        Causality\n                Because of the law of causality, decoding process can\n                not depend on a not-yet-happened event. Thus, for an\n                interactive processing, as immediate output is required,\n                a shape of a character can not depend on the\n                possibly-not-yet-typed next character.\n        Finitestateness\n                The decoding process might be controlled by a stateful\n                automaton. But, as long as the plain text processing\n                concerns, the state transition should be represented\n                with a finite state automaton.\n        Finite Resynchronizability\n                Even if the state of the finite state automaton become\n                unknown, the resynchronization of the state should be\n                possible by reading fixed finite number of bytes.\n        Equality\n                Equality of two text should be defined unambiguously, of\n                course.\n        ASCII compatibility\n                The encoding should be ASCII compatible so that no\n                conversion of files nor no modification to protocols\n                necessary.\nAt the bof, there was no objection to any of the requirements.\n\n5) It is agreed that for major European characters, ISO 10646 level 1\nwith UTF2 satisfies all the above requirements but ISO 10646 does not\nsatisfy any (save ASCII compatibility) of the requirement if several\nother languages are taken into consideration.\n\n6) A 21 bit encoding, ICODE, and its external representation, IUTF, was\npresented by me as an extension to ISO 10646 and UTF2, which satisfies\nall the requirement in 4) and also supports bidirectionality.\n\n7) During the discussion on ICODE, it was pointed out that ICODE\ndo use the non private code point of UCS4. So, ICODE was slightly\nmodified to also have an explicite representation as UCS4 (not necessarily\nequal to ICODE) which use the private use zone for the extension,\nso that ICODE is now completely compatible with ISO 10646. So, characters in\nICODE now have three representations:\n        UCS4\n        ICODE\n        IUTF\nEven if the private area is moved by the ISO in the future (as suggested\nby John), it is only necessary to change the mapping from ICODE to UCS4\nwhich eventually does not affect any ICODE program because no one will\nuse UCS4 representation.\n\n8) Someone (Harald, I think) said 32bit universal encoding is the\nultimate goal and showed several pathes to the goal.\n\n9) It was agreed that the ultimate goal  shouldn't break ISO 10646.\n\n10) It was agreed that the number of code conversion should be minimized.\n\n11) Borka said it is also important to have conversion method of\ncharacters so that many Euro characters are visible on, say, ASCII only\ncharacters. There was no objection.\n\n                                                Masataka Ohta\n\nPS\n\nThose who have not attended the bof might think that the summary contains\ntoo much presentation and opinion of me. But, it actually took large\namount of the time of the entire BOF.\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It is our hope that ISO\n   10646 or some other effort will eventually define a single world\n   character set which can then be specified for use in Internet mail\n   [and other protocols], but in the advance of that definition we\n   cannot specify the use of ISO 10646, Unicode, or any other character\n   set whose definition is, as of this writing, incomplete.\n\nThis holds for any batched or simple request/response protocol, where\nnegotiation is impossible.

Some of the MIME designers, while recognizing the importance\nof character set issues, \"didn't like\" the problems associated with them\nand simply wished they would go away.  As someone who struggled with\nthose issues in the MIME context, I can't say that I blame them.\n\nBut an important MIME design principle might be stated as \"make sure\nthat information needed to decode a message [body part] is available in\nthe right place so that a user or UA can dispatch the body part to the\nright component/decoder.  In the case of text/plain and character sets,\nthat implied external-to-the-text-body labeling so that one could route\nthe body part to something that would \"know\" those codings and support\neither the right graphics for the codes or a sensible representation\n(possibly mnemonic or some extension on quoted-printable) for the\nunknown ones.\n\nThe important \"2022 is not a character set\" principle, in the MIME\ncontext, derives primarily from the fact that one cannot deduce from\nknowing that a text body part is \"in 2022\" what graphics will be needed\nand what registrations will occur.   \"iso-2022-jp\" arises precisely\nbecause it provides a body-part dispatcher information about the actual\nformats (escape and switching sequences) used and the\ncodes/registration/graphics that they will require.\n\nIn this context, and for MIME, the labels that would have been\nassociated with 10646 DIS-1 or -- if one believes in Han unification --\nUNICODE or IS 10646 BMP pose no particular problems (although the more\nparanoid among us might insist on a date as part of the label): These\nprovide Standard character code tables, whose content and required\ngraphics are known at time of publication and revised very infrequently\nand usually compatibly.\n\nBut \"unrestricted 2022\" or \"IS 10646 including planes and groups not yet\ndefined\" are much harder to label in a useful way since it is difficult,\nif not impossible, to write a piece of code that can guarantee sensible\nrepresentations for all of the characters in all files with that\nparticular label.  In particular, if such a program is written today, it\nis unlikely that it will behave optimally (or even reasonably) with a\ncharacter set registered with ECMA next week or with 10646.x\nstandardized in 1995.\n\nNote that I'm trying to state a problem here, not suggesting an answer.\nBut I do suggest that anything that proports to be a definition for\n\"full 10646\" in the MIME context must address this issue.\n\n   john\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

The list of attendees will be\nincluded.\n\nIntroductory brief  tutorial was given by  Borka  Jerman-Blazic.   She\npointed out to some of the problems which appear on the network due to\nthe lack of support of the national character sets used for input/output\n/processing/displaying the text written in  languages used all over the\nworld.   She   stressed  the  need  for   proper  maintenance  of  the\ncharacter integrity over the network. The requirement for processing and\ninterchanging different character sets correclty is  especially  rele-\nvant  for  some  internet  services  dealing  with names of persons or\norganizations.\n\nPeter Svanberg gave  short  overview  of  the  level  of  support  for\nnon-ASCII character sets in different Internet protocols.  Some of the\nprotocols were identified as hostile to 8 bits characters.  Among them\nDNS,  SMTP, FTP, NNTP, WAIS, MIME Text/Enhanced, NFS, AFS, Whois, URN,\nGopher etc.  The more recently developed protocols such as MIME part 1\nand part 2 as well as some currently on-going projects such as Whois++\nas was mentioned by  Simon  Spero  support  16  bits  coding  and  the\nrepertoires  provided  by such coding.  He mentioned too, that several\nIETF groups developing new protocols/services consider the  importance\nof the proper support of the character sets problem.\n\nThe next speaker was Mr.Masatak Ohta.  He presented his view regarding\nthe idea the International Universal  Coding  system to be  recommended\nfor use over the Internet. He identifyed 5 properties which are required\nto be present in the recommended coding system.  These are:\n\nIdentity for encoding and  decoding  which  he  understand  as  unique\nmapping  between  particular   graphic  character  and  its  code (bit\ncombination),\n\nCausality understanded as independence of a processed coded  character\nfrom the other incomming characters in the data stream,\n\nFinite  State Recognition,  state dependence of the code  required for\npresentation/display of multi-octed coded data,\n\nFinite resynchronizability which means that the state  of  automation\ncan be determined uniquely by reading fixed finite number of octets,\n\nEquality,  requirement  that  a  character coded with different coding\nsystem can be always recognized as the same character.\n\nMr Ohta  looked for the required properties in ISO 10 646 and find out\nthat  the  Causality and Finite resynchronizability are not satisfied.\nEquality is not yet worked out.   He  proposed  an  extension  to  the\nexisting  UCS  code  system consisting of 5 additional bits which will\nenable  the deficiency of the UCS coding system to be overcomed.   The\ndiscussion  showed  that  the  proposed solution is not in the general\nstream of the development of the  standard  character  set  codes  and\ntheir  applications  in  the  computing  systems.  One of the possible\nsolutions to the problems identified by Mr.Ohta could be  the  use  of\nthe  whole model of UCS i.e the 4 envisaged octets which define besides\nthe cell and row position for a character in  the  Multilingual  Basic\nPlane  of ISO 10 646 additional planes and groups.  There was proposal\nthe required 5 additional bits to be coded as a private plane  in  the\nUCS  scheme.   John  Klensin noted that such approach could clash with\nthe reassignment of a such plane in the futher standardization process\nof  ISO  JTC1/SC2.   In  the  discussion  the  problem  of handling of\nbidirectional text was also identified.\n\nHarald Alvestrand pointed out that what is happening now is a sort  of\ntransition  period between 8-bit coding and 16-bit coding provided with\nUCS.  Other parralel stream for support of different national  charac-\nter  sets  is  the \"character switching\" which is enabled by use of the\ncode extension technique of ISO 2022.  It was obvious that this scheme\nis  not of practical use for Internet except for special cases i.e the\nJapanese e-mail solution.\n\nThe BOF then discussed the possible working items if  IESG approve the\nformation  of  a  working  group.  The chair identifyed several papers\nwhich are Internet drafts dealing with  the  character  sets  problems\nsuch  as:  RFC  1345,  \"X400 use of the international character sets\",\n\"Character Sets  and  Languages\".   Other  items  were  discussed  and\nproposed  by  the   BOF  attendees.   They are summarized below.  John\nKlensin pointed out that special precautions has to be  taken  in  the\nrecommendation  of  UTF 2 as data interchange method over the Internet\nin connection with the  possible  assignements  of  additional  coding\nplanes  by  JTC1  SC2.   He  also  recommended the use of mailing lists\nalready working within IETF.  They  are:  <ietf-charsets@innosoft.com>\nand two others working on mailing issues (822ext and 821).\n\nAs a summary the BOF decided to propose to IESG to consider the possi-\nbility of setting up of a working group to work on the following work-\ning items:\n\n- a  document defining how UCS  can  be  used  in  a  uniform  way  in\nInternet  protocols,  especially  taking  in  consideration  the UTF-2\nencoding  of  UCS.   The  document  will  provide  guidance  to  other\nprotocols which have to deal with these items over the  Internet,\n\n-a document identifying  the languages and the characters required for\ncoding text written in  particular  natural   language  (a  sort  of\nguidelines   for  services dealing with multilinguality such as NIR\nservice based on usage of plein text),\n\n-a document defining a tool for coded character sets conversion  to  be\nprovided  within  some  services  such  as e-mail user agent including\nfall-back representation of incoming characters that are  outside  the\nsupported character repertoire of the receiver,\n\n-a  proposal  for  extending  the  mandatory  issues  which have to be\ncovered in the RFC standardization process to  include  character  set\nconsideration/support.\n\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

I just want to\nknow, because I don't think we can seek the solution for all the\nmultilingual problem here now.\n\nAs for the character encoding scheme, I think we should make the scheme\nwith which all the languages in the world can be encoded/decoded even\nif dozens of languages are mixed freely within single text.\n\nBut, should we address the further multilinguality issues? For example,\nspecifying 8859-1 does not mean one can accept both English, French and\nGerman. Should we develop protocols to treat that type of multilinguality\nnow?\n\nI think we shouldn't until we have an agreed ultimate encoding scheme.\n\n> >Yes.

And, then, the commonly available keyboard will still be ASCII.

This is not\npossible with any other encoding of 10646.\n\n> We are not supposed to discuss here on specifically on RFC 1345, at all.\n\nRFC 1345 techniques should be amongst the discussion items allowed here,\nIt is one of the ways to  represent 10646.

The character set experts at the meeting maintained that RFC 1502 does\n   solve the need for better MIME support for European languages in the\n   short term.  Or to be more precise, they see a need for the likes\n   of RFC 1502, and they maintain that what it proposes is compatible with\n   how ASN.1 and BER should be used.\n\n2. The sentiment was that RFC 1502 should consider use of the CHARACTER\n   STRING type instead of embedding the encoded material in an OCTET STRING.\n\n3. There was much sentiment for the usefulness of being able to\n   encode an ISO 10646 character in a single octet, but no National Body\n   except the U.S. was willing to push forward with this idea (the U.S.\n   proposal gives all languages equal access in selecting which row is\n   used for the 1 octet encoding).  The stated reason for not wanting\n   a single octet ISO 10646 encoding was that this is an SC2 matter and\n   they did not wish to be party to in effect undoing an SC2 resolution.\n   At the end of the day all National Bodies except the U.S. and France\n   abstained in voting on this matter (they maintained that it was a U.S.\n   / France fight). France maintained its NO vote on the idea of having a\n   single octet per character encoding for ISO 10646 strings, and the U.S.\n   voted YES. Since there was a deadlock and the text was already in the\n   base document, the vote was resolved by remaining with the status quo -\n   so there is now no BER support for encoding ISO 10646 character\n   strings one octet per character.\n\n4.

It has several variants\nand several possible encoding schemes.

UTF-2 is a proposed encoding for all of these.\n\nThe final solution will not be based on 16-bit wide characters externally,\nbut will rather be >16 bits internally, and use variable length representation\nexternally, partly for compatibility with ASCII, partly to represent common\nsymbols with short codes, even for far east languages.  It will allow\nintermixing of dozens of languages within the same paragraph.\n\nThe issues of bidirectionality, comparison, and equality testing were\nmentioned very briefly- they may have been discussed offline at a BOF.\nPerhaps someone familliar with these issues could post a word or two about\nthem.\n\nA list of eight or ten important properties of the final encoding solution\nwere posted and more or less agreed to.\nSeveral proposals for the encoding were posted, with no clear winner.\nMost try to be compatible with the UTF-2 encoding.\n\nFor several months, people argued and had trouble communicating, although\nthey seemed in basic agreement about goals.

Book Review: The New Nutshell Handbook on sendmail ................... 70\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFowarded by: Liedong Zheng\n\nTitle: Sendmail\nBy Bryan Costales, with Eric Allman & Neil Rickert\n1st Edition November 1993 (est.)\n750 pages (est.), ISBN: 1-56592-056-2, $32.95 (est.)\n\nBook Description:\n\nThis new Nutshell Handbook is far and away the most comprehensive book ever\nwritten on sendmail, a program that acts like a traffic cop in routing and\ndelivering mail on UNIX-based networks. Although sendmail is used on almost\nevery UNIX system, it's one of the last great uncharted territories--and\nmost difficult utilities to learn-- in UNIX system administration.\n\nThis book provides a complete sendmail tutorial, plus extensive reference\nmaterial on every aspect of the program. What's more, it's authoritative,\nhaving been co-authored by Eric Allman, the developer of sendmail, and Neil\nRickert, one of the leading sendmail gurus on the Net.\n\nThe book covers both major versions of sendmail: the standard version\navailable on most systems, and IDA sendmail, a version from Europe that uses\na much more readable configuration file. Part One of the book is a tutorial\non understanding sendmail from the ground up. Starting from an empty file,\nit has the reader work through exercises, building a configuration file and\ntesting the results. Part Two covers practical issues in sendmail\nadministration, while Part Three is a comprehensive reference section.\n\nAuthor Information:\n\nBryan Costales is System Manager at the International Computer Science\nInstitute in Berkeley, California. He has been writing articles and books\nabout computer software for over ten years. His most notable books are C\nfrom A to Z (Prentice Hall), and Unix Communications (Howard Sams). In his\nfree time (chuckle, chuckle) he sails San Francisco Bay in his 26 foot\nsloop, goes camping with his Land Rover, and walks his dog Zypher. He is an\navid movie viewer, reads tons of science fiction, and plays chess and\nvolleyball.\n\nEric Allman is the Lead Programmer on the Mammoth Project at the University\nof California at Berkeley. This is his second incarnation at Berkeley;\npreviously, he was the Chief Programmer on the INGRES database management\nproject. In addition to his assigned tasks, he got involved with the early\nUNIX effort at Berkeley. His first experiences with UNIX were with 4th\nEdition, and he still has the manuals to prove it (and has been accused of\nbeing a pack rat because of it). Over the years, he wrote a number of\nutilities that appeared with various releases of BSD, including the -me\nmacros, tset, trek, syslog, vacation, and of course sendmail.\n\nEric spent the years between the two Berkeley incarnations at Britton Lee\n(later Sharebase) doing database user and application interfaces, and at the\nInternational Computer Science Institute, contributing to the Ring Array\nProcessor project for neural-net-based speech recognition. He also\nco-authored the \"C Advisor\" column for Unix Review for several years.\n\nEric has been accused of working incessantly, enjoys writing with fountain\npens, and collects wines which he stashes in the cellar of the house that he\nshares with Kirk McKusick, his partner of 14 and-some-odd years. He is a\nmember of the Board of Directors of USENIX Association, which is much more\nwork than he had expected.\n\nNeil Rickert earned his Ph.D. at Yale in Mathematics. He is currently a\nprofessor of computer science at Northern Illinois University. He likes to\nkeep contact with the practical side of computing, and so spends part of his\ntime in UNIX system adminstration. He has been involved with the IDA\nsendmail project, and is largely responsible for the current version of the\nIDA configuration.\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Move over, ASCII!  Unicode Is Here .................................. 310\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nForwarded by: Liu Jian\nSource: PC Magazine, October 26, 1993\nWritten by: Petzold, Charles\n\nA great concept deserves a great name, and that name is Unicode.\n\nSay it to yourself a few times. Get used to it. The prefix uni is from the\nLatin word for one, and the word code (as defined in sense 3a in The\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary) is \"A system of signals used to represent\nletters or numbers in transmitting messages.\"\n\nSay it again: Unicode.  How hip and mellifluous the word is, particularly\nwhen compared with ASCII (pronounced ASS-key), EBCDIC (EB-see-dik), or even\nBaudot (baw-DOE). These comparisons are quite valid, for the goal of Unicode\nis nothing less than to dislodge and replace what is perhaps the most\ndominant standard in personal computing--the American Standard Code for\nInformation Interchange.\n\nAmbitious? Of course. But Unicode makes so much sense, it seems inevitable.\nCheck out some of the companies that collaborated in The Unicode Consortium\nto bring Unicode about: IBM, Microsoft, Apple, Xerox, Sun, Digital, Novell,\nAdobe, NeXT, Lotus, and WordPerfect.\n\nWith the release of Windows NT, Unicode has become not just a proposed\nstandard, but a reality, and in the next couple of issues we'll take a look\nat that reality. Let's begin, however, with a historical perspective, and\nwhy Unicode is so important to the future of computing.\n\nCODING LANGUAGE\n\nHuman beings differ from other species in their comparatively high level of\ncommunication and the development of spoken language. The need to record\nspoken language led to writing, which makes it possible to preserve and\nconvey knowledge and experience.  Computers and other digital systems work\nentirely with numbers, so to represent text in our computers, it is\nnecessary to create an equivalence between numbers and characters.\n\nUntil the invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse in the mid-1800s,\nlong-distance communication required letters to be transported by person,\nhorse, or train. The telegraph made long-distance communication nearly\ninstantaneous by transmitting a series of electrical pulses through a wire.\nBut what do electrical pulses have to do with language? The telegraph\nrequired that a code be devised correlating each letter in the alphabet with\na particular series of short and long pulses (dots and dashes) that sounded\nlike clicks on the receiving end.\n\nMorse code was not the first instance of written language being represented\nby something other than drawn or printed glyphs.  Braille came earlier and\nwas inspired by a system for coding secret military messages. And Morse code\nwas not a binary system: The long and short pulses had to be separated by\ndifferent delays between letters and words. Binary systems for representing\nwritten language (letters represented by a fixed-length series of 0s and 1s)\ncame later.\n\nOne of the early binary systems used in telexes was called Baudot (named\nafter a French engineer who died in 1903). Baudot was a 5-bit code.\nNormally, the use of 5 bits is limited to representing 32 characters, which\nis sufficient for the 26 characters of the alphabet (not differentiated by\ncase) but not much else. However, one Baudot code represented a \"shift\" that\nmade subsequent codes map to numbers and punctuation symbols. This feature\nextended Baudot to be nearly as extensive as a 6-bit code.\n\nThe American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was crowned\nas a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) some 20\nyears ago. As defined by ANSI, ASCII is a 7-bit code, of which the first 32\ncodes and the last code are control characters (such as a carriage return,\nline-feed, and tab). That leaves room for 26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase\nletters, 10 numbers, and 33 symbols and punctuation marks.\n\nASCII has become the dominant standard for all computers, except for\nmainframes made by a not-insignificant company called IBM. The IBM heavy\niron machines use an 8-bit system called the Extended Binary Coded Decimal\nInterchange Code (EBCDIC). Using 8 bits should allow for twice as many codes\nas ASCII, but much of the EBCDIC code space is not assigned. One peculiarity\nis that EBCDIC doesn't represent the alphabet with consecutive codes--the\ncapital letters A through I are hexadecimal codes 0xC1 through 0xC9; J\nthrough R are 0xD1 through 0xD9; and S through Z are 0xE2 through 0xE9. This\nonly makes sense when you see the patterns on punch cards!\n\nTHE WORLD BEYOND OUR BORDERS\n\nWith the exception of IBM mainframes, ASCII is just about the only standard\ncommon among computers. No other standard is as prevalent or as ingrained in\nour keyboards, video displays, system hardware, printers, font files,\noperating systems, electronic mail, and information services.\n\nBut there's a big problem with ASCII, and that problem is indicated by the\nfirst word of the acronym. ASCII is truly an American standard, but there's\na whole wide world outside our borders where ASCII is simply inadequate. It\nisn't even good enough for countries that share our language, for where is\nthe British pound sign in ASCII?\n\nAmong written languages that use the Latin (or Roman) alphabet, English is\nunusual in that almost all of our words use the bare letters without accent\nmarks. Go across the Atlantic and take a look at the French, German, or\nSwedish languages in print to see a variety of diacritics that originally\naided in adopting the Latin alphabet to the differences in spoken sounds\namong these languages.\n\nJourney farther east or south, and you'll encounter written languages that\ndon't use the Latin alphabet at all, such as Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and\nRussian (which uses Cyrillic). And if you travel even farther east, you'll\ndiscover the logographic Han characters of Chinese, which were also adopted\nin Japan and Korea. (Interestingly enough, in Vietnam you'll come across the\nLatin alphabet again, a triumph of sorts for early missionaries!)\n\nI live in one of the most ethnically diverse cities of the world--New York.\nEvery day I witness this diversity in a potpourri of languages heard and\nseen on the streets. There are Ukrainian churches, Korean delicatessens,\nChinese restaurants, Pakistani newsstands, and subway advertisements in\nlanguages I don't even recognize.\n\nAnd then I come home and use ASCII, a character-encoding system that is not\nonly inadequate for the written languages of much of the world, but also for\nmany people who live right in my own neighborhood.\n\nWe simply can't be so parochial as to foster a system as exclusive and\nlimiting as ASCII. The personal computing revolution is quickly encompassing\nmuch of the world, and it's totally absurd that the dominant standard is\nbased solely on English as spoken in the U.S.\n\nI can't pretend to be dispassionate on this subject. The character encoding\nused in our computers must truly reflect the diversity of the world's people\nand languages.\n\nONGOING ATTEMPTS\n\nOf course, there have been some partial solutions to this problem. Because\nASCII is a 7-bit code, and 8-bit bytes have become common in many systems,\nit is possible to extend ASCII with another 128 characters. The original IBM\nextended character set included some accented characters and a lowercase\nGreek alphabet (useful for mathematics notation), as well as some block- and\nline-drawing characters.\n\nUnfortunately, this extended character set did not include enough accented\nletters for all European languages that used the Latin alphabet, so\nalternative extended character sets were devised.  These are called code\npages, and they still exist in DOS and (in great profusion) in OS/2. OS/2\nusers and programs can switch among code pages and get a different mapping\nof 8-bit codes to characters. An OS/2 program can even select extended\nEBCDIC code pages for over ten different languages!\n\nMicrosoft didn't entirely abandon the IBM extended character set in the\nfirst and subsequent versions of Windows, but most Windows fonts were built\naround an alternative extended character set. Microsoft called this the\n\"ANSI character set,\" but it was actually based on an ISO (International\nStandards Organization) standard. The ANSI character set abandons the block-\nand line-drawing characters to include more accented characters that are\nuseful for European languages employing the Latin alphabet.\n\nBut what about non-Latin alphabets? Some font vendors devised solutions to\nrendering other alphabets (such as Hebrew) with fonts designed specifically\nfor that purpose. With such fonts, ASCII codes normally corresponding to the\nLatin alphabet are mapped to characters in other alphabets.\n\nWith either code pages or alternative fonts, the interpretation of 8-bit\ncharacter codes is ambiguous because it depends upon the selected code page\nor font. And then there's the problem of communicating with the Macintosh,\nwhich uses a different extended character set than either the original IBM\nPC or Windows uses. Even when communicating over electronic mail in American\nEnglish, I sometimes see odd characters in letters from my Mac-user friends.\n\nAnother response to the limitations of ASCII is the double-byte character\nset (DBCS). With DBCS, some characters require 1 byte and some require 2\nbytes (indicated by an initial byte greater than hexadecimal 0x80). This\nsystem allows representing both the ASCII character set and a non-Latin\nalphabet. DBCS has problems of its own, though, such as multiple standards.\nAlso, because DBCS characters are not of uniform length, programmed parsing\nbecomes difficult. For example, you can't simply skip ahead 6 characters by\nskipping ahead 6 bytes. You have to look at each and every character to see\nif it's represented by 1 or 2 bytes.\n\nUNICODE TO THE RESCUE\n\nThe basic problem is that the world's written languages simply cannot be\nrepresented by only 256 8-bit codes. The previous solutions have proven\ninsufficient and awkward. What's the real solution?\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to figure out that if 8 bits are inadequate, then\n16 bits might be just fine. Congratulations!  You've just invented Unicode!\n\nUnicode is truly as simple as that: Rather than the confusion of multiple\n256-character code mappings or double-byte character sets that have some\n1-byte codes and some 2-byte codes, Unicode is a uniform 16-bit system, thus\nallowing the representation of 65,536 characters. This is sufficient for all\nthe most common characters and logographs in all the written languages of\nthe world (including some math and symbol collections), with about half the\ncode space left free.\n\nSixteen-bit characters are often called wide characters. Wide characters do\nnot necessarily have to be Unicode characters, although for our purposes\nI'll tend to use the terms Unicode and wide characters synonymously.\n\nTHE WINDOWS NT SUPPORT\n\nOf course, dealing with character codes that are 16 bits in length rather\nthan 8 is quite a foreign concept to many of us. We are so accustomed to\nidentifying a character with 8 bits that it seems unnatural and impossible.\nWhat about our operating systems? What about our programming languages? What\nabout our hardware and printers?\n\nIt's really not as bad as it sounds, although obviously quite a few years\nwill pass before Unicode replaces ASCII as the universal system of character\ncoding. Still, some essential support is already falling into place.\n\nYou can write programs for Windows NT that continue to use the ASCII\ncharacter set, or you can write programs that use Unicode.  You can even mix\nthe use of ASCII and wide characters in the same program.  How does this\nwork?  Well, every function call in Windows NT that requires a character\nstring as a parameter (and there are quite a few of them) has two different\nentry points in the operating system.  For example, there is a TextOutA\nfunction (the ASCII version) and a TextOutW function (the wide-character\nversion); depending on the definition of an identifier, the name TextOut is\ndefined as one or the other of them. We'll see how this works in more detail\nin a future column.\n\nThe ANSI standard for C also has support for wide characters, and this\nsupport is included in Microsoft's C compiler for Windows NT. Rather than\nusing the strlen() function to find the length of a string, for example, you\ncan use wcslen() (which translates to \"wide character string length\").\nInstead of using sprintf() to format a string for display, you can use\nswprintf().\n\nWhat about displaying non-Latin characters on our video displays and\nprinters? Well, TrueType also supports wide character sets, and while a\nTrueType font file containing all the Unicode characters might be somewhere\nin the region of 5 to 10 megabytes, that's not an inordinate size for\nrepresenting characters of all the world's written languages.\n\nTHE REFERENCE BOOKS\n\nUnicode is documented in two volumes compiled by The Unicode Consortium and\npublished by Addison Wesley in 1991 called The Unicode Standard: Worldwide\nCharacter Encoding, Version 1.0.\n\nBecause the books contain charts showing all the characters of Unicode, they\nare marvelous to explore, and I highly recommend them. These books reveal\nthe richness and diversity of the world's written languages in a way that\nfew other documents have. In addition, the books provide the rationale and\ndetails behind the development of Unicode.\n\nYou'll probably be pleased to know that the first 128 codes of Unicode are\nidentical to ASCII, thus facilitating a conversion from ASCII to Unicode.\n(Just add another zero byte to each ASCII character.) The second 128\ncharacters are called the Latin 1 character set, which is the same as the\nWindows character set except that hexadecimal codes 0x0080 through 0x009F\nare defined as control characters in Latin 1. Many blocks of non-Latin\ncharacters are also based on existing standards, also easing conversions.\n\nCodes 0x0100 through 0x01FF provide additional variations of the Latin\ncharacter set. The codes 0x0400 through 0x04FF are for Cyrillic. Armenian,\nHebrew, and Arabic come next, and soon you'll encounter more esoteric\nlanguages such as Devanagari (used in classical Sanskrit and modern Hindi),\nBengali, Gurmukhi, and Gujarati (all North Indian scripts). And on and on\nand on.\n\nThe famous Zapf Dingbats character set uses codes 0x2700 through 0x27BF, and\nthe Han ideographs begin at 0x4E00. These Han characters are used to\nrepresent whole words or concepts in Chinese, and they are also used in\nJapanese and Korean.  Unicode contains over 20,000 Han characters, about a\nthird of the entire code space.\n\nWHAT UNICODE DOESN'T ADDRESS\n\nSorting words in English is made easier by the consecutive coding of letters\nin the ASCII character set. The coding of characters in Unicode does not\nimply any collation sequence, and if you think about it, it doesn't make\nmuch sense to pretend that we know how to alphabetize a collection of words\nusing different alphabets such as Latin, Hebrew, and Bengali.\n\nEven sorting English words is not as straightforward as ASCII would imply,\nbecause alphabetizing words is usually case-insensitive.  Thus, sorting\nalways requires special consideration beyond the simple numeric sequence of\ncharacter codes. And even with extended ASCII character sets, sorting gets\nmore complex with the accented Latin letters of many European languages. But\nat least with Unicode we have a consistent encoding of accented letters, so\na table could be created that allows reasonable sorting.\n\nAnother issue Unicode doesn't address is the use of similar alphabets and\nlogographs in different countries. For example, there are no separate\nFrench, German, or Finnish character sets within Unicode.  The written\nlanguages of these countries share many unaccented and accented Latin\ncharacters.\n\nThe situation is similar for the Han logographs. Quite often, the same Han\ncharacter represents something different depending on whether it's used in\nChinese, Japanese, or Korean.  Unicode makes no attempt to reflect these\ndifferences. If the character is in Unicode, then it can be used in any of\nthose three languages, regardless of its meaning.\n\nAnother problem with international programming is that some written\nlanguages do not run from left to right on the printed page.  Unicode\nspecifies that character strings be stored in logical order, which is the\norder that someone would type the characters from a keyboard. Properly\ndisplaying such text is left up to an application, but the Unicode reference\nbooks contain some information on this issue.\n\nCAN IT BE DONE?\n\nUnicode is certainly an important step in the move towards truly\ninternational programming. The question of whether it can really replace\nASCII as the standard for worldwide character coding is almost irrelevant.\nIt simply must.\n\nIn my next columns on this subject, I'll refrain from further proselytizing\nand will focus on the programming mechanics involved in using Unicode.\n\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2. Unicode, Wide Characters, and C ..................................... 344\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nForwarded by: Liu Jian\nSource: PC Magazine, November 9, 1993\nWritten by: Petzold, Charles\n\nPeople who write about computers in more general interest magazines often\navoid using the word byte, instead describing storage capabilities in terms\nof characters. That's a pretty simple conversion, because one character of\ntext requires 1 byte of storage. Right?\n\nWrong! When dealing with ASCII character sets, the equivalence is certainly\ncorrect. But ASCII character sets (even when extended by another 128 codes)\nare unable to represent anything beyond the Latin alphabet and some accented\nletters used in European alphabets.  Several makeshift solutions exist, such\nas non-Latin fonts and double-byte character sets (DBCS). In a DBCS, some\ncharacters require 1 byte and some require 2; those requiring 2 bytes are\nused for Far Eastern languages.\n\nA far better solution for international computing is to replace ASCII with a\nuniform 2-byte character encoding. As I discussed in the last issue, the\nsystem that shows the most promise of becoming a standard is Unicode.\nUnicode was developed by a consortium of big names in the computer industry\nand is supported by Windows NT. Its first 128 codes are the same as ASCII,\nbut it is capable of representing all the characters of all the written\nlanguages of the world. It may even come to pass someday that journalists\nwho write about computers in general-interest magazines will have to adjust\ntheir convenient equivalence of bytes and characters. (Presumably they can\ndivide by 2!)\n\nWhen Unicode text is stored in memory or files, character strings are\nrepresented as a series of 16-bit values rather than as bytes.  The first\ntime I encountered this concept, I got the shivers. How on earth do you use\nyour favorite programming language with Unicode?  Luckily, other people have\nconsidered that problem, and support for \"wide characters\" (as they are\ncalled) is part of the ANSI C standard. That's what I'll examine in this\nissue.\n\n   EIGHT-BIT CHARACTERS\n\nWe all know how to store characters and character strings in our C programs.\n You simply use the char data type. But to facilitate an understanding of\nhow C handles wide characters, let's first review normal character\ndefinition.\n\nThe following statement defines and initializes a variable containing a\nsingle character:\n\n   char c = 'A' ;\n\nThe variable c requires 1 byte of storage containing the value 65 (the\nhexadecimal value 0x41), which is the ASCII code for the letter A.\n\nYou can define a pointer to a character string like so:\n\n   char * p ;\n\nWindows NT, being a 32-bit operating system, reserves 4 bytes of storage for\nthe character pointer. You can also initialize a pointer to a character\nstring:\n\n   char * p = \"Hello!\" ;\n\nIn this case, the variable p requires 4 bytes of storage, and the character\nstring is stored in static memory using 7 bytes of storage--the 6 bytes of\nthe string plus a terminating zero.\n\nYou can also define an array of characters, like this:\n\n   char a[10] ;\n\nIn this case, the compiler reserves 10 bytes of storage for the array. If\nthe array variable is global (outside any function), you can initialize it\nwith\n\n   char a[] = \"Hello!\" ;\n\nIf you define this array as a local variable to a function, it must be\ndefined as a static variable, as follows:\n\n   static char a[] = \"Hello!\" ;\n\nIn either case, the string is stored in static program memory with a zero\nappended at the end, thus requiring 7 bytes of storage.\n\n\nLET'S GET WIDER\n\nThe char data type continues to be a single-byte value in C. To use 16-bit\nwide characters in a C program, you must include the WCHAR.H (wide\ncharacter) header file in your program:\n\n   #include <WCHAR.H>\n\nThis header file contains definitions of new data types, structures, and\nfunctions for using wide characters. In particular, WCHAR.H defines the new\ndata type wchar, t as\n\n   typedef unsigned short wchar, t ;\n\nAlthough the int data type has grown from 16 bits to 32 bits under the\nWindows NT C compiler, the short data type is still a 16-bit value. Thus,\nthe wchar, t data type is the same as an unsigned short integer.\n\nTo define a variable containing a single wide character, you use the\nfollowing statement:\n\n   wchar, t c = 'A' ;\n\nThe variable c is the two-byte value 0x0041, the Unicode representation of\nthe letter A. (However, given the Intel protocol of storing\nleast-significant bytes first, the bytes are actually stored in memory in\nthe sequence 0x41, 0x00.  Keep this fact in mind as we examine the output of\na sample program shortly.)\n\nYou can also define and initialize a pointer to a wide character string:\n\n   wchar, t * p = L\"Hello!\"\n\nNotice the L (for long) directly preceding the first quotation mark. This\nindicates to the compiler that the string is to be stored with wide\ncharacters, that is, with every character occupying 2 bytes.  The variable p\nrequires 4 bytes of storage, as usual, but the character string requires 14\nbytes--2 bytes for each character with two bytes of zeros at the end.\n\nSimilarly, you can define an array of wide characters this way:\n\n   wchar, t a[] = L\"Hello!\" ;\n\nThe string again requires 14 bytes of storage.\n\nAlthough it looks rather ugly and unnatural, that L preceding the first\nquotation mark is very important, and there must not be a space between the\ntwo symbols. Only with that L will the compiler know you want the string to\nbe stored with 2 bytes per character.  Later on, when we look at wide\ncharacter strings in places other than variable definitions, you'll\nencounter the L preceding the first quotation mark again. Fortunately, the C\ncompiler will often give you an error message if you forget to include the\nL.\n\nLET'S TRY IT OUT\n\nIf the concept of wide character strings is new to you, you're definitely\nnot alone, and you may be skeptical that this can really work. So let's try\nit out.  The UNITEST1 program is shown in Figures 1 and 2.\n\nTo compile and run this program, you'll need Windows NT 3.1 and the\nMicrosoft Win32 Software Development Kit installed. You can compile and link\nthe program using the command line\n\n   NMAKE UNITEST1.MAK\n\nNotice that the UNITEST1.C program includes the WCHAR.H header file at the\nbeginning. The program defines two character strings (the text \"Hello,\nworld!\"), one using the char data type and the other using wchar, t. The two\nvariable names for these character strings are acString (the ASCII version)\nand wcString (the wide-character version). UNITEST1 then uses the printf\nfunction to display each string, determine its storage size, determine the\nnumber of characters using the strlen function, and then display the first\nfive characters in both character and hexadecimal format.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice when compiling the program is a warning\nmessage reading (in part) \"incompatible types - from 'unsigned short[14] to\n'const char*'.\" This message results from passing the wcString variable to\nthe strlen function, which expects a pointer to a character string but gets\ninstead a pointer to a string of short integers. It's only a warning\nmessage, so the compilation will continue and you can run the program. The\nresults are shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe top half of the output looks fine, exactly as we expected. But what\nhappened with the wide character string? First, printf simply displays the\nstring as 'H. Why is this? Well, printf expected a string of single-byte\ncharacters terminated by a zero byte. The first character has a 16-bit\nhexadecimal representation of 0x0048.  But these bytes are stored in memory\nin the sequence 0x48, 0x00.  The printf function thus assumed that the\nstring was only one character long. Similarly, the strlen function reported\nthat the string was only a single character.\n\nEverything else seems to work. In particular, the sizeof operator reported\nthat the ASCII string required 14 bytes of storage, and the wide character\nstring required 28 bytes of storage. Also, indexing the wchar, t array\ncorrectly retrieves each character of the string for printf to display.\n\nThis program clearly illustrates the differences between the C language\nitself and the runtime library functions. The compiler interprets the string\nL\"Hello, world!\" as a collection of 16-bit short integers and stores them in\nthe wchar, t array. The compiler also handles the array indexing and the\nsizeof operator correctly.  But the runtime library functions strlen and\nprintf are added during link time. These functions expect strings comprised\nof single-byte characters. When confronted with wide character strings, they\ndon't perform as we'd like.\n\nTHE WCHAR LIBRARY FUNCTIONS\n\nThe solution is alternate runtime library functions that accept wide\ncharacter strings rather than single-byte character strings. Fortunately,\nsuch functions exist in Microsoft's 32-bit C compiler package, and they're\nall defined in WCHAR.H.\n\nFor example, the wide-character version of the strlen function is called\nwcslen (wide character string length); the wide-character version of the\nprintf function is called wprintf. Let's put these two functions to use in\nthe UNITEST2 program shown in Figures 4 and 5. Notice that in the second\npart of the UNITEST2 program, the strlen program has been replaced with\nwcslen, and all the printf functions have been replaced with wprintf\n(although only one of them gave us trouble in UNITEST1).\n\nThe only other code change is that a capital L now precedes the formatting\nstring in the wprintf functions. From personal experience, I guarantee\nyou'll frequently forget to include the L when you first start working with\nwide character strings. When you use the wide character functions defined in\nWCHAR.H, every string you pass to them must be composed of wide characters.\n\nThe output of UNITEST2 is shown in Figure 6. This is what we want. Although\nthe size of the wide character string is 28 bytes (the 13 wide characters\nplus the terminating 16-bit zero), the wcslen function reports 13\ncharacters. Keep in mind that the character length of a string does not\nchange when you move to wide characters--only the byte length changes. And\nas I explained earlier, a byte is not necessarily a character.\n\nBUT WHAT'S THE POINT?\n\nOf course we haven't yet established any real benefit to using Unicode in\nthese two programs. We're still displaying pure ASCII text in character\nmode.  The character mode font in the U.S.  version of Windows NT isn't\ncapable of displaying the extra Unicode characters. If such characters\nappeared in a string, they'd simply be ignored upon display. (You can test\nthis by inserting, for example, the character x0413 into the wcString array.\nThis is the character code for a letter in the Cyrillic alphabet.)\n\nOf course, where Unicode is most important is in graphical Windows NT\nprograms. Indeed, the retail release of Windows NT is shipped with a\nTrueType font containing a small subset of the complete Unicode character\nset. It's called Lucida Sans Unicode, and it includes additional accented\nLatin letters; the Greek, Cyrillic, and Hebrew alphabets; and a bunch of\nsymbols. We'll be making good use of this font in future columns when we\nbegin exploring the use of Unicode in graphical programs. For now, we're\nsimply trying to nail down the mechanics of using wide characters in a C\nprogram with the C runtime library functions.\n\nMAINTAINING A SINGLE SOURCE\n\nThere are, of course, certain disadvantages to using Unicode.  First and\nforemost is that every string in your program will occupy twice as much\nspace.  In addition, you'll observe that the functions in the wide character\nruntime library are larger than the usual functions. For this reason, you\nmight want to create two versions of a program--one for a U.S. market that\nworks strictly with ASCII and another for an international market that uses\nUnicode.  The best solution would be to maintain a single source code file\nthat you could compile for either ASCII or Unicode.\n\nThat's a bit of a problem, though, because the runtime library functions\nhave different names, you're defining characters differently, and then\nthere's that nuisance of preceding the string literals with an L.\n\nOne answer is to use the TCHAR.H header file supplied with Microsoft's\n32-bit C compiler. (My speculation is that the T of TCHAR stands for text.)\nThis header file is not part of the ANSI standard, so every function and\nmacro defined therein is preceded by an underscore. TCHAR.H provides a set\nof alternative names for the normal runtime library functions requiring\nstring parameLB<ters; for example , tprintf and , tcslen.\n\nIf an identifier called , UNICODE is defined and the TCHAR.H header file is\nincluded in your program, then , tprintf is defined to be wprintf:\n\n   #define , tprintf wprintf\n\nIf not, then , tprintf is defined to be printf:\n\n   #define , tprintf printf\n\nAnd so on. TCHAR.H also solves the problem of the two character data types\nwith a new data type named TCHAR. If the , UNICODE identifier is defined,\nthen TCHAR is wchar, t:\n\n   typedef wchar, t TCHAR ;\n\nOtherwise, TCHAR is simply a char:\n\n   typedef char TCHAR ;\n\nNow it's time to address that L problem. If the , UNICODE identifier is\ndefined, then a macro called , , T is defined like this:\n\n   #define , , T(x) L##x\n\nThat pair of number signs is called a \"token paste\" and causes the letter L\nto be appended to the macro parameter. If the , UNICODE identifier is not\ndefined, the , , T macro is simply defined in the following way:\n\n   #define , , T(x) x\n\nRegardless, two other macros are defined to be the same as , , T:\n\n   #define , T(x) , , T(x)\n\n   #define , TEXT(x) , , T(x)\n\nWhich you use will depend on how concise or verbose you would like to be.\nBasically, you must define your string literals inside the , T or , TEXT\nmacro in the following way:\n\n   , TEXT (\"Hello, world!\") ;\n\nThis causes the string to be interpreted as composed of wide characters if\nthe , UNICODE identifier is defined, and as 8-bit characters if not.\n\nLet's test it out with a single source code module named UNITEST3.C. Figures\n7 and 8 show two make files, one for creating the ASCII version of the\nprogram (UNITESTA) and the other for the Unicode version (UNITESTW).\nUNITESTA.MAK compiles UNITEST3.C, shown in Figure 9, to create an object\nmodule named UNITESTA.OBJ. (Note that the compile command line uses the -Fo\noption to give the object file a different name than the source code file.)\nThe UNITESTA.OBJ file is linked to create UNITESTA.EXE. UNITESTW.MAK is\nsimilar, except that the compile line also uses the -D (define) option to\ndefine the identifier , UNICODE.\n\nUNITEST3 displays only one set of output lines. The printf and wprintf\nfunctions have been replaced with , tprintf. The strlen and wcslen functions\nhave been replaced with , tcslen. The definition of the character string now\nuses the TCHAR data type. All character strings are enclosed in the , TEXT\nmacro. Note that the program includes both WCHAR .H and TCHAR.H. The output\nfrom UNITESTA.EXE and UNITESTW .EXE is identical except for the line that\nreports the number of bytes occupied by the string in memory.\n\nWHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?\n\nWe've seen how to use both ASCII strings and Unicode strings in the same\nsource code file, and how to have a single source code file that can be\ncompiled for either ASCII or Unicode.  Of course what I've discussed in this\ncolumn doesn't represent the extent of converting an existing program to\nUnicode.  You'll have to find any places in your code where you've\npreviously assumed that the size of a character is a byte or where you\naccess a binary buffer or file as if it were a collection of characters.\n(You can download the UNITEST program and source code file from PC MagNet's\nProgramming Forum, archived as UNI.ZIP.)\n\nIn the next installment of this column, we'll examine how the Windows NT API\nprovides methods for using ASCII and Unicode in the same program, or for\ncreating a single source that can be compiled for either. The methods are a\nlittle different from those provided by the C compiler, C runtime library,\nand header files, but as you will see, the results are similar.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                  Executive Editor: Sifeng Ma (U.S.A.)                    |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| CINET-L (China's InterNET Tech Forum) is a non-public discussion list,   |\n| however, CINET-EDITOR@CND.ORG welcomes contributions on networking in    |\n| China.

            "content": "Maybe someone from the list can help these people, the message is\nfrom the Unicode list.\n\nRegards,\n========================================================================\n\n        I am trying to do somethign with X-Windows and Unicode. I have the\n     O'Reilly books and I have some idea about how the 16 bit font routines\n     and how the wc font routines from R5 work. Working from the R5 update\n     book and Ken Lunde's Japanese Information Processing Book, I think I\n     have to do something like the project at Waseda which does\n     multi-lingual text by using the wc/mbs routines and an all-inclusive\n     \"locale\" file.\n\nWe (AIX) have done exactly this in a internal prototype we have.\nWe have built a locale and an \"Xlocale\" that incorporates all of the\nISO8859 family, Japanese, Korean and Chinese charsets.  The locale\nuses FSS-UTF as the file code set (i.e. returned from nl_langinfo(CODESET))\nand the wide character is 16-bit wchar_t.\n\n        Some things I don't understand:\n\n     1. How does one write a locale file? For X-windows, not for C.\n\nWithin the X I18N community this is referred to as the \"Xlocale\" database.\nUnfortunately, with release R5 from X11 the sample implementation\ncame with 2 different types of Xlocale.  (We are working to\nunify this with R6).  Depending on which implementation you are using\nyou need to look at different formats.  But all Xlocale databases are\ndescribed in /usr/lib/X11/nls/*.   If you have the MIT source tape,\nyou can look at\n\n.../mit/lib/nls/Xsi     - Xlocale database definitions\n.../mit/lib/X/Xsi       - source code (methods)\nor\n.../mit/lib/nls/Ximp    - Xlocale database definitions\n.../mit/lib/X/Ximp      - source code (methods)\n\nEach has samples of various formats.  We (AIX) do not use either of these\nstrictly (we based it on Xsi but added some other features).\n\n     2. How do the wc/mbs routines know which font to use from a font\n     set? I'm guessing that it takes a character and checks the fonts\n     specified by the font set in order, until it finds one that has\n     a glyph for that character. Where is this information?\n\nThe basic premise is that each locale is split into multiple \"charsets\".\nEach charset is associated with a specific font encoding.  E.g. for\nja_JP.eucJP, the locale is split into 3 charsets:\n\ngeneric name    standard JIS charset    Font charset (glyph encoding)\n------------    --------------------    ----------------------------\nRomaji          JISX 0201 (GL)          JISX0201.1979-0\nKatakana        JISX 0201 (GR)          JISX0201.1979-0\nKanji           JISX 0208               JISX0201.1983-0\n\nSo the Xlocale database defines the number of charsets and the\nrespective font charset to be used.  At XCreateFontSet() time, the\nXlocale databases is referenced to match the locale's knowledge of\ncharsets with what the Xlocale database defines for font encoding.\nIt then queries the X server for all fonts and does a matching\nalgorithm to match the fonts to the Xlocale database definition.\n\nThe bottom line is that along with the Xlocale database there are\na set of methods (refer to .../mit/lib/X/[Ximp|Xsi] to see the code.\n\nI am not sure either of the R5 can handle UTF/Unicode without some\nmodifications of the code.  Mainly because of the conversion from UTF/Unicode\nencoding to MIT X font encodings.  So you need conversions to\ncomplete the job.\n\n     3. The O'Reilly book seems to say that X can handle a context\n     dependent language such as Arabic (one where there is more than one\n     glyph per character and which character is used depends upon the\n     context of the surrounding characters). I can't figure out the details\n     of how or where this done, or how one would write one's own context\n     routine.  Where is this information?\n\nDon't try.  There is only one functions to state whether the XFontSet\ndoes \"context dependent\" drawing.  Yet, no one has done it yet.  And even\nif set, it is not enough information to know what is going on.  There\nis some activity for R6 but not guaranteed to make it.    Read the\nXContextDependent??() function in R5.\n\nWe have added both bi-directional and contextual support but outside of\nthe Xlib.\n\n     4. Special bonus question: where can I get fonts for foreign X-windows\n     fonts? I can't seem to find anything except ISO-8859-1 and\n     ISO-8859-whatever=hebrew=is, and Japanese fonts. I would like to find\n     other ISO-8859-n fonts, because I think it would be relatively easy to\n     rearrange them in a Unicode order.\n\nNot from MIT :-(.   There are several places  on the internet (e.g. Thai,\nKorean and Chinese) but I've lost contact of where they are.  There is a\ngroup within the X Consortium that discusses these questions so I\nsuggest you contact them for advise (sorry I can't give out the email\naddress).\n\n     Tom Fruchterman\n     RAF Technolgy\n     tom@raf.com\n\n\n Frank Rojas\n\n AIX Internationalization Architecture     VNET:    AUSTIN(FXROJAS)\n Advanced Workstation and System Division  Tie-line 678-8183\n IBM, Mail 9652                            Phone:   (512) 838-8183\n Austin, TX 78758                          FAX:     (512) 838-8374\n                                     AWD Net: fxrojas@nlsarch.austin.ibm.com\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Where does the need for marking the languages come from?\n\nNo, you will not find any coded character set capable of\ndistinguishing between an Old High German \"A\", an Old English\n\"A\", and a modern \"A\". This is _not_ a result of the imperfect\nlevel of development of coded character sets, however.\n\nYour mistake is a confusion of text representation levels:\n\n1) In all existing coded character sets only the content of a\n   text is encoded. This is what you get if you use _plain text_:\n   Only those distinctions necessary to make the text legible is\n   coded.\n\n2) To also keep such _rich text properties_ of text as\n   italicization, boldness, smaller or bigger character size,\n   language-correct choice of glyphs, correct hyphenation\n   behavior, you can't remain on the basic plain text level, but\n   must enter a higher rich text level.\n\n3) In most existing rich text formats these text properties are\n   represented by some kind of mark-up of the plain text. This\n   is certainly the case for the SGML-based TEI encoding system\n   developed to meet the needs of linguists.\n\n4) There are also very sound technical reasons for not including\n   a bit for each binary rich text property in the bit sequence\n   representing a character in a coded character set. These\n   properties, including language, do very seldom vary between\n   each character. They are constant for a chunk of the text,\n   sometimes of considerable length.\n\n> >I _would_ support making the country code into something that should be used\n> >only if it is absolutely necessary to disambiguate different usages of the\n> >same language.  e.g. French and French-Canadian which have different\n> >capitalisation rules I believe. ...\n> - - -\n> Hmmm...

This memo\n   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution and\n   translation of this memo is unlimited.\n\nIntroduction\n\n   This memo describes a text encoding scheme: \"ISO-2022-JP-2\", which is\n   used experimentally for electronic mail [RFC822] and network news\n   [RFC1036] messages in several Japanese networks.  The encoding is a\n   multilingual extension of \"ISO-2022-JP\", the existing encoding for\n   Japanese [2022JP].  The encoding is supported by an Emacs based\n   multilingual text editor: MULE [MULE].\n\n   The name, \"ISO-2022-JP-2\", is intended to be used in the \"charset\"\n   parameter field of MIME headers (see [MIME1] and [MIME2]).\n\nDescription\n\n   The text with \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" starts in ASCII [ASCII], and switches\n   to other character sets of ISO 2022 [ISO2022] through limited\n   combinations of escape sequences.  All the characters are encoded\n   with 7 bits only.\n\n   At the beginning of text, the existence of an announcer sequence:\n   \"ESC 2/0 4/1 ESC 2/0 4/6 ESC 2/0 5/10\" is (though omitted) assumed.\n   Thus, characters of 94 character sets are designated to G0 and\n   invoked as GL.  C1 control characters are represented with 7 bits.\n   Characters of 96 character sets are designated to G2 and invoked with\n   SS2 (single shift two, \"ESC 4/14\" or \"ESC N\").\n\n   For example, the escape sequence \"ESC 2/4 2/8 4/3\" or \"ESC $ ( C\"\n   indicates that the bytes following the escape sequence are Korean KSC\n   characters, which are encoded in two bytes each.  The escape sequence\n   \"ESC 2/14 4/1\" or \"ESC . A\" indicates that ISO 8859-1 is designated\n   to G2. After the designation, the single shifted sequence \"ESC 4/14\n   4/1\" or \"ESC N A\" is interpreted to represent a character \"A with\n   acute\".\n\n\n\nOhta & Handa                                            [Page 1]\n\nRFC nnnn                     ISO-2022-JP-2              28 November 1993\n\n\n   The following table gives the escape sequences and the character sets\n   used in \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" messages.

This means that the next line starts\n   in the character set that was switched to before the end of the\n   previous line.  Though the designation to JIS X 0201-Roman is allowed\n   for backward compatibility to \"ISO-2022-JP\", its use is discouraged.\n   Applications such as pagers and editors which randomly seek within a\n   text file encoded with \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" may assume that all the lines\n   begin with ASCII, not with JIS X 0201-Roman.\n\n   At the beginning of a line, information on G2 designation of the\n   previous line is cleared.  New designation must be given before a\n   character in 96 character sets is used in the line.\n\n   The text must end in ASCII designated to G0.\n\n   As the \"ISO-2022-JP\", and thus, \"ISO-2022-JP-2\", is designed to\n   represent English and modern Japanese, left-to-right directionality\n   is assumed if the text is displayed horizontally.\n\n   Users of \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" must be aware that some common transport\n   such as old Bnews can not relay a 7-bit value 7/15 (decimal 127),\n   which is used to encode, say, \"y with diaeresis\" of ISO 8859-1.\n\n\n\nOhta & Handa                                            [Page 2]\n\nRFC nnnn                     ISO-2022-JP-2              28 November 1993\n\n\n   Other restrictions are given in the Formal Syntax section below.\n\nFormal Syntax\n\n   The notational conventions used here are identical to those used in\n   RFC 822 [RFC822].\n\n   The * (asterisk) convention is as follows:\n\n      l*m something\n\n   meaning at least l and at most m somethings, with l and m taking\n   default values of 0 and infinity, respectively.\n\n   message             = headers 1*(CRLF text)\n                                          ; see also [MIME1] \"body-part\"\n                                          ; note: must end in ASCII\n\n   text                = *(single-byte-char /\n                           g2-desig-seq /\n                           single-shift-char)\n                          [*segment\n                           reset-seq\n                           *(single-byte-char /\n                             g2-desig-seq /\n                             single-shift-char ) ]\n                                          ; note: g2-desig-seq must\n                                          ; precede single-shift-char\n\n   headers             = <see [RFC822] \"fields\" and [MIME1] \"body-part\">\n\n   segment             = single-byte-segment / double-byte-segment\n\n   single-byte-segment = single-byte-seq\n                         *(single-byte-char /\n                           g2-desig-seq /\n                           single-shift-char )\n\n   double-byte-segment = double-byte-seq\n                         *((one-of-94 one-of-94) /\n                           g2-desig-seq /\n                           single-shift-char )\n\n   reset-seq           = ESC \"(\" ( \"B\" / \"J\" )\n\n   single-byte-seq     = ESC \"(\" ( \"B\" / \"J\" )\n\n   double-byte-seq     = (ESC \"$\" ( \"@\" / \"A\" / \"B\" )) /\n\n\n\nOhta & Handa                                            [Page 3]\n\nRFC nnnn                     ISO-2022-JP-2              28 November 1993\n\n\n                         (ESC \"$\" \"(\" ( \"C\" / \"D\" ))\n\n   g2-desig-seq        = ESC \".\" ( \"A\" / \"F\" )\n\n   single-shift-seq    = ESC \"N\"\n\n   single-shift-char   = single-shift-seq one-of-96\n\n   CRLF                = CR LF\n\n                                                    ; ( Octal, Decimal.)\n\n   ESC                 = <ISO 2022 ESC, escape>     ; (    33,      27.)\n\n   SI                  = <ISO 2022 SI, shift-in>    ; (    17,      15.)\n\n   SO                  = <ISO 2022 SO, shift-out>   ; (    16,      14.)\n\n   CR                  = <ASCII CR, carriage return>; (    15,      13.)\n\n   LF                  = <ASCII LF, linefeed>       ; (    12,      10.)\n\n   one-of-94           = <any one of 94 values>     ; (41-176, 33.-126.)\n\n   one-of-96           = <any one of 96 values>     ; (40-177, 32.-127.)\n\n   7BIT                = <any 7-bit value>          ; ( 0-177,  0.-127.)\n\n   single-byte-char    = <any 7BIT, including bare CR & bare LF, but NOT\n                          including CRLF, and not including ESC, SI, SO>\n\nMIME Considerations\n\n   The name given to the character encoding is \"ISO-2022-JP-2\". This\n   name is intended to be used in MIME messages as follows:\n\n\n\n   The \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" encoding is already in 7-bit form, so it is not\n   necessary to use a Content-Transfer-Encoding header. It should be\n   noted that applying the Base64 or Quoted-Printable encoding will\n   render the message unreadable in non-MIME-compliant software.\n\n   \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" may also be used in MIME headers.  Both \"B\" and \"Q\"\n   encoding could be useful with \"ISO-2022-JP-2\" text.\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nOhta & Handa                                            [Page 4]\n\nRFC nnnn                     ISO-2022-JP-2              28 November 1993\n\n\n   [ASCII] American National Standards Institute, \"Coded character set\n   -- 7-bit American national standard code for information\n   interchange\", ANSI X3.4-1986.\n\n   [ISO2022] International Organization for Standardization (ISO),\n   \"Information processing -- ISO 7-bit and 8-bit coded character sets\n   -- Code extension techniques\", International Standard, Ref.

It is for plain text.\n\nIt is finite state. It has no nesting.\n\nI don't think anything with nested structure is plain text.\n\nIt is and its successors will be as stateless as practically possible\nwith ISO 2022.\n\nThat is, at the beginning of a line, the state can be assumed to be unique.\n\n> The main difference I can see is that ISO-2022-JP-2\n> requires the use of markup, even when the whole message is in the same\n> language, but UNICODE can get away without markup for 99% of messages,\n\nIt is a meaningless difference.\n\nWhether it is 1% or 100%, you need the same amount of codings, fonts,\nsettings of config.sys and such, anyway.\n\n> letting local conventions set the default language.\n\nThat is one of a very important difference.\n\nUnlike UNICODE, ISO-2022-JP-2 is intended to be used in internationalized\nenvironment. It needs no local conventions. BTW, MIME charsets also, can\nnot depend on local conventions.\n\n> I still fail to see why Masataka objects to UNICODE since his own proposal ha\ns\n> to jump through the same markup hoops. The only advantage of ISO-2022-JP-2\n> that I can see is that it will work on existing terminals without special\n> software in some communities.\n\nThen, you can see nothing.\n\nISO-2022-JP-2 is produced from long and extensive\nlocalization/internationalization experiences in Japanese computer community\nwith ISO-2022-JP, EUC, SJIS and such.\n\nFirst of all, ISO-2022-JP-2 can interoperate with ASCII.\n\nNext, it is 7 bit.\n\nThus, it can interoperate with any ASCII compatible text encoding such\nas EUC (both UJIS and EUC-KR) and SJIS.\n\nMore importantly, it can interoperate with the future ultimate ASCII\ncompatible 8 bit encoding. Of course, UNICODE is NOT the future.\n\nWe do know that having two or more uninteroperable encodings such\nas EUS and SJIS or ASCII and 16bit-UNICODE is the real pain.\n\n> A specious argument at best, since the rest\n> of the world does need special software to view ISO-2022-JP-2 anyway.\n\nISO-2022-JP-2 is, and ISO-2022-INT-1 will be, designed to aid those\nwho immediately need localization.\n\nI don't think it be a long term solution.\n\nBoth ISO 2022 and ISO 10646/UNICODE has a unified syntax to mix\nmultilingual characters in the world. ISO 2022 is much better for\nus to be able to separate C/J/K characters.\n\nOn the other hand, both ISO 2022 and ISO 10646/UNICODE lacks a unified\nsemantics to mix multilingual characters in the world. ISO 10646/UNICODE\ninherits the policy of ISO 2022 to treat characters in different languages\ndifferently. Thus, it is impossible to write a unified text processing\nlibrary or application of meaningfully rich functionality.\n\nThus, for the time being, our solution must be 7 bit ISO 2022.\n\nAs a long term solution, I have designed ICODE/IUTF, which has, besides\nASCII compatibility, several useful semantical properties for, as far\nas I know, all the characters in the world. With a large enough encoding\nspace (though not impractically large), the real, semantical, unification\nis possible.\n\n> UNICODE has the advantage that if a message gets corrupted and the markup\n> is lost, there is still a reasonable character that can be displayed, which\n> is close enough not to cause the sky to fall in on the reader.

Providing workarounds will only result in the delay\nof the real solution.\n\nInstead, the real state corruption problem is caused in an interactive\nenvironment where individual programs output their own text streams\nsimultaneously.\n\nWith ISO-2022-JP-2, unlike text/enriched, the state is resumed at the\nbeginning of the next line.\n\n> People have tried time and again to add markup to UNICODE to satisfy Masataka\n> (e.g. language tags), but it just doesn't seem to satisfy him. *sigh*\n\nStrange.\n\nI have *ABSOLUTELY* *NO* interest in text/enriched from the beginning.\n\nI and most of the people in the world want to process our natural\nlanguages as plain text in internationalized environment.\n\nWe already have a lot of experience to use our languages as plain text.\n\nYou can't force us give up plain text.\n\n                                                        Masataka Ohta\n\nPS\n\nFor more information on ICODE, why ISO 10646/UNICODE is no good and how\ncan it be improved, see:\n\n        \"Character Encoding Method for Internationalized Plain\n        Text Processing\", Proceedings of 8th International Joint\n        Workshop on Computer Communications, Masataka OHTA,\n        Dec. 1993.\n\nelectric copy is available from me.\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It seems that Ohta san proposals\nare not in line with the official Jpanase stand point.\n\nRegards,\n\n==================\n\n\nYesterday I received ISO JTC1 SC2 WG2 December 1993 pack and\nI browsed through it during the long (1 hour) wait for contact lens\nadjustment at my daughter's optometrist.\n\nI found very instructive (as an amateur of Zhong Wen [Chinese culture]), and\ninteresting, Beijing's contribution N937, a proposal to add a new category of\nstructured combinations to form virtually all existing Chinese characters on\nearth: it even says how to combine the radicals to present them, bearer of\nvery useful information.  I found in document N995 (minutes of WG2 meeting 24)\nthat there were communication problems with the Chinese delegates and that this\nhad caused the group to send China to IRG instead of WG2 for presenting this\nproposal.  How come?  It seems to me that it is WG2 matter, I guess people had\nnot read the interesting contribution before, which is extremely economic in\nstorage and allowing tens of thousands new characters for virtually no storage\ncost in table data. 2nd question: What is IRG, so that I explain that to my\nAAA (Anti-Acronymic Association) local chapter?  (-: :-)\n\nThen I read the Japanese Position on an extension of UCS (N938): I tend to\nagree with Professor Shibano that either UCS-2 is used as is or then we leap to\nUCS-4 if extensions are needed.  My personal feeling is in agreement with the\nexpression of some members that most installations will not want to pay for\nmore than 2 octets per character.  This said, exposed with the error-prone\nproblem of extension mechanisms, most installations that would require to go\nbeyond that in my opinion would nevertheless prefer the simplicity of one and\nonly one straightforward standard as UCS-4.  Inventing a new ISO 2022 will only\ndo harm in my humble opinion.  So I strongly agree with the Japanese\nposition on this.  You may find this contradictory with my previous paragraph:\nfor Chinese I said I found that interesting and instructive and I think it\ncould be part of an informative annex, but first I have to study it more to see\nif it is not too complex to handle, even if at first glance I think the imbedde\nd\nsemantics might be worth the variable code in this single case only (as\nother combining characters also have merits which I do not contest).\n\n\nHave a very Merry Christmas, \"hot\" if you're in the Southern Hemisphere, and\n\"snowy\" (even artificially for most of you) in the Northern one, and a very\nhappy new civil year of 1994.\n\nAlain LaBonte'\nMinist`ere des Communications du Que'bec\nin the world capital of white snow, Que'bec\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

How many Unicode products are on\nthe market in Japan?  [I know of one, the Kanji version of GO's Penpoint\noperating system; I'm sure others are being developed now.]  For a given\nUnicode product on the market in Japan, in what way is it \"not acceptable\"?\n\nIt is a bit pointless to make broad statements like this without providing\na few facts; such as, what specifically is it about Unicode that makes it\nunsuitable for use in Japan?  Whether the Japanese voted yes or no (on\nISO/IEC 10646, and not Unicode) is not relevant to the feasibility of\nUnicode (and ISO/IEC 10646) in Japan.\n\nI will offer some comments on the feasibility of Unicode in Japan:\n\n1. Unicode is only a character set, period.  It is not a font.  It\nis not an I18N subsystem.  It is not a library which applications may\nuse to implement I18N solutions.  It is just a character set.  Its\npurpose is to represent character data of all languages (and not to\nmeet the special needs of a particular language over and above the\ntask of representing its character repertoire).\n\n2. Unicode contains all of the characters in the three JIS standards\nJIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212.  In addition, it contains many\nCJK ideographs which are not in these character sets but which are used\nas 'gaiji' characters by users in Japan.  In order to convert between JIS\ndata (of various encoding styles such as EUC-JP, ISO 2022J, Shift JIS,\netc.) and Unicode, all that is required is a 2-way mapping table for\neach of the three JIS standards.  The mapping table for JIS X 0208\nrequires approximately 26Kbytes to support mappings in both directions.\nSuch a mapping loses no data; i.e., round-trip conversion is possible\nwithout losing any information.\n\n3. Unicode does not prescribe the visual appearance of a character; therefore,\nin displaying Japanese text encoded in Unicode, it would be quite proper to\nuse a JIS 0208 or 0212 encoded font, or a Japanese font of any other encoding\nfor that matter.\n\n4. Unicode does not prescribe the sorting order of a character; therefore,\nin sorting Japanese text encoded in Unicode, it would be quite proper to\nuse a JIS oriented sorting weight table if a user expects text to be ordered\naccording to JIS, or by any other acceptable sorting order desired by the\nuser.  [One should recognize that a sorting order based on JIS order is\nnot entirely acceptable in many cases either; e.g., two completely separate\nsorting methods are used in JIS X 0208, one based on phonetic order (for\nlevel 1 kanji), the other based on radical/stroke order (for level 2 kanji);\nJIS X 0212 (level 3 kanji) also uses the radical/stroke technique.  There\nhave been a number of articles published in Japan about problems with\ndepending on the order proscribed by JIS for performing sorts which meet\nuser expectations.]\n\nGiven the above facts, one can only conclude that there is no technical\nreason whatsoever that a given piece of software using Unicode couldn't\nmeet the needs of Japanese users according to the capabilities provided\nby a character set.  Of course, Unicode, as a character set, needs software\nto make it useful.  It is that software which must meet the needs of\nJapanese users; Unicode by itself does not prevent such needs being met\nas well as existing JIS based systems.  If anything it facilitates creating\nbetter, more encompassing Japanese software systems since it incorporates\nall JIS sets into a single fixed width character set.  This by itself\nwill help the development of Japanese software by providing a way to\nmigrate away from the stateful, multibyte encoding systems such as\nISO 2022 or EUC-JP.\n\nYou might wonder why I haven't mentioned anything about the unification\nof Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs in Unicode.  The reason I\ndidn't mention it is because it doesn't have a bearing on using Unicode\nto represent Japanese text.  Nor does it have a bearing on using Unicode\nto represent Chinese text.  The only time it does have a bearing is\nwhen one wants to represent mixed CJK text.  In such a case, if one wants\nto employ a different font to display the same character in a way that\nis acceptable to a Chinese reader versus a Japanese reader, then it will\nbe necessary to augment such a representation with font tags (or with\nlanguage tags) so as to enable selecting the correct font.  For a non-\nUnicode system to do this now would also require doing the same, or,\nalternatively, mixing multiple character sets such as JIS X 0208, GB 2312,\nand KS C 5601, and then selecting different fonts based on the character\nset.  Such a technique requires tagging the character set of a given\ncharacter from which the language or font can be inferred.  In the case\nof Unicode, one would use a single character set, Unicode, and then\nemploy a font or language tag explicitly.  The difference between the\ntwo tecniques is neglible.  However, using Unicode gives one the ability\nto not require processing multiple character sets at the same time.\nThis, after all, was perhaps one of the most important goals of Unicode.\n\n  Does this mean a product that supports Unicode alone will not be as\n  acceptable as a product that handles Japanese character sets using\n  other encoding methods.\n\nThe acceptability of a product will be based on whether it meets a user's\nneeds, not on what character set it uses (assuming that the given character\nset meets the character repertoire needs in the first place, which Unicode\ndoes).\n\n  What one other encoding should a product use in addition to Unicode in\n  order to succeed in Japan?  Or will Unicode be adapted to succeed?\n\n  How soon?\n\nNo other encoding is needed (internally).  Of course and application will\nneed to be able to import/export text in other existing character sets,\nbut it needn't use them internally.\n\nUnicode will not be adapted to meet non-existent needs.  If the Japanese\n(or anyone else) does identify real needs, then they will certainly be\nevaluated.  The Unicode consortium welcomes public participation in\nits technical discussions and at its meetings.\n\nKeep in mind that Unicode, Version 1.1, is now synchronized with ISO/IEC\n10646-1:1993, developed by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2.  Unicode is essentially\na usage profile of ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 (UCS-2, Level 3).  Because ISO/IEC\n10646 is a very important international standard, the Japanese development\ncomputer and communications industries will certainly take it into account\nas a legitimate standard.\n\n\nSender: Asmus Freytag <asmusf@microsoft.com>\n\n| I have heard that while Unicode contains Kanji, it does so in a way\n| that is not acceptable to the Japanese market, and hence was not\n| approved by them in recent votes.  Does this mean a product that\n| supports Unicode alone wil not be as acceptable as a product that\n| handles Japanese character sets using other encoding methods.\n\nTo see why this is a strange question, let's ask it about English.  What\nabout the acceptibility of products for English that support only Unicode\n(and not ASCII).  Well, first off, how would I (the user) know it didn't\nhandle ASCII?  Only if it fails to import data files in ASCII, in other\nwords, \"if it is not compatible\".  Nobody wants incompatible products, so\nnew prodcucts ALWAYS need to be prepared to deal with existing data.\n\n| What one other encoding should a product use in addition to Unicode\n| in order to succeed in Japan?  Or will Unicode be adapted to succeed?\n| How soon?\n\nThe answer to the first half, depends on the user.  In a PC environment\nin Japan, Shift-JIS (with vendor extensions) is the most widely used\nnative character encoding.  A new piece of software supporting Unicode\nmust be able to accept existing data files in Shift-JIS.\n\n| (It is bad enough we will probably make two versions of some products, 8 bit\n| ISO-Latin and Unicode, but if we have to maintain a 3rd version this becomes\n| lunacy).\n\nThe choice is more one like this:  Do I make a separate 8-bit (Latin-1)\nand Shift-JIS version of my application, or do I create a single Unicode\nversion (with appropriate compatibility with existing data, e.g.  by\none-time or on the fly conversion).\n\nIn case of Windows NT, Microsoft decided to only create one version of\nthe core operating system.  The kernel, file system, etc.  all support\nexclusively Unicode.  At the same time Windows NT for Japan will be a\ncompatible player in the Shift-JIS environment:  It will run Shift-JIS\nWindows and DOS applications out of the box, the file system is able to\nread and write directory information on disks that were formatted using\nShift-JIS, etc.  So for the user in Japan interested in doing just what\nhe or she has always been doing, there will be no observable\nchange--despite the fact that the system supports _only_ Unicode in its\nbowels.\n\nThe change is visible for Microsoft, where adapting the system to Japan\nis taking less than half the amount of time it took for Windows 3.1, and\nfor application vendors who now, for the first time, have the choice of\nwriting only _one_ version of their application for NT, namely the\nUnicode version.  This Unicode version will run without modifications\n(other than translating the user interface) on the Japanese version of NT\nas well as any other version of NT.\n\nIt is this simplification, that will drive the acceptance of Unicode as a\ndelivery vehicle in the long run, especially as the vast majority of\npackaged software is createdd by vendors who sell software globally.\n\nI have used the term \"delivery vehicle\" deliberately.  Nobody expects\nthat overnight all existing data (and host computers, and...)  will have\ntransformed themselves.  So what we are looking for is a vehicle that\nlets us provide software cost effectively that delivers functionality\ninto markets with very different legacy character sets.  Unicode is the\ndelivery vehicle for that kind of future software.\n\n\nSender: Chiaki Ishikawa (pmcgw!personal-media.co.jp!ishikawa@uunet.UU.NET)\n        Personal Media Corp.\n        Tokyo, Japan\n\n>> I have heard that while Unicode contains Kanji, it does so in a way that is\nnot\n>> acceptable to the Japanese market, and hence was not approved by them in rec\nent\n>> votes.

However, standard is only valid as long as the user/vendor\nstick to it. If the standard is not followed by the user/vendor\ncommunity very well, it will die of obsolescence.\n\nWhether the ignorance tactics of Unicode opponents succeeds depends\nupon the success of Unicode in Japan, and I think it is directly\nrelated to the success of Windows NT.\n\n[I myself think (a) unification was NOT carried out with all the grace\nand cultural acceptability to the taste of Japanese computer\ncommunity.  I am sorry that I don't have time for discussion right\nnow, am too busy doing work for a project that has to be finished\nwithin this year. I thank Glenn of Unicode Consorcium who seems to\nread this mailing list to have enlightened me about Unicode early this\nyear when I had time to post to comp.std.internat. He might be\namused/shocked to learn of the small committee of which I mention\nabove. Somehow the reading room magazine rack of my office had the\nliterature from the comittee. It is full of mumbo jumbo of ABC soup of\nstandard acronyms and hard to understand their own opinion. But I\nthink my description of their intention is accurate enough. You might\nwant to monitor comp.std.internat newsgroup for occasional heated\narguments therein regarding Unicode.]\n\n(2)   \"Does this mean a product that supports Unicode alone wil not be as\n        acceptable as a product that handles Japanese character sets using othe\nr\n        encoding methods?\n\nYes, definitely. If you are not prepared and your product doesn't fly,\ndon't blame it on the Japanese distribution system :-)\n\n        \"What one other encoding should a product use in addition to Unicode in\n order to\n        succeed in Japan?  Or will Unicode be adapted to succeed?  How soon?\"\n\nMy personal opinion is that the success of Unicode hinges on the\nacceptance of Windows-NT in Japan. This is because Microsoft\nWindows-NT is using Unicode. It is anyone's guess whether WNT will be\nTHE desktop on which multi-lingual word processing, for example, will\ntake place in the next few years.  (Aside from Intel platform, DEC\nalso promotes Alpha PC which runs Windoes/NT as well OpenVMS, and\nUltrix. But, DEC being in the low profile it is in in terms of\ncommercial success, it is not followed closely by majority of the\nJapanese market.)\n\nIt will be a couple of years whether Windows NT will be a success in\nthe sense of Windows's success. So we don't know whetehr Unicode is\nwidely adopted or not in Japan.  In the meantime, you can't come to\nJapan and expect reasoanble marketing success unless your system\nsupports\n\n- (MS-DOS): Shift-Jis Japanese code system\n        Oh, incidently this is the character code system used by\n        Windows application, too.\n\n- (UNIX): EUC ... Japanese Extended Unix Code.\n\nSome WS vendors use Shift-Jis for better interoperability with DOS\napplication, but their market share is minor. HP is among them.  But,\nthey seem to have provide EUC support nowadays. Sun is the market\nleader and they use EUC, period.\n\n[and if you need to talk to old mainframe or yours is more\n concerend with communication software - (JIS): There are\n several JIS standards. You will know what you will need if your\n software is geard to communication.]\n\nSo, the choice of the character code system depends upon which target your\nproduct is meant for. Ask your local representative of your target\nhardware company which code they use in Japan.\n\nCurrently, other than Microsoft Win/NT (and possibly some Japanese\nmakers who might bundle Win/NT in Japan), I haven't heard of ANY\nJapanese computer manufacturer who supports Unicode today or have\nannounced to support Unicode anytime soon. (Correct me if I am wrong.)\n\nJapanese mainframe vendors such as Nihon IBM, Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC\nhave character code system which is an extension of JIS to support\nunusual (slight variation) of characters for proper nowns: name of\npeople and places.  They add characters to base JIS standard they have\nadopted.\n\nThis and other compatibility issues were being addressed with\ncurrent and then on-going JIS standard activity to codify\ncharacter code system at ISO level when UNICODE preempted, so to\nspeak.\n        I think an early JIS delegate to ISO committee was somewhat\ntaken aback to learn recently that Unicode people are now consiering\nthe extension to the current Unicode to accommocate more characters by\nclever encoding (allowing more than 2 bytes for a character) because\nhe seems to have felt that if we would go above 2 byets there were no\nneeds for \"Han Unification\" at all to begin with!\n\n>> (It is bad enough we will probably make two versions of some products, 8 bit\n\n>> ISO-Latin and Unicode, but if we have to maintain a 3rd version this becomes\n\n>> lunacy).\n\nYou can say that again. I think there are people who are driven up the\nwalls with the introduction of Unicode.\n\nMe? Although I think the UNICODE unification was a lousy idea, I will\ngo as the wind blows. You can't argue with the majority of your target\naudience as far as character set issues are concerned.\nFor example, I despise S-JIS and don't want to use it , but what can I do other\nwise\nif I want to use DOS PC in Japan?\n\nOne consolation is there is one to one map between\nEUC <-> S-JIS <-> JIS (and Unicode).\nSo if you have a conversion filter built once, at least the conversion\nshouldn't be THAT hard.\n\n\nSender: David Goldsmith <David_Goldsmith@taligent.com>\n        Taligent, Inc.\n\nThis question was forwarded to the 10646 mailing list.

While I cannot speak for Japanese\ncustomers, I have a perspective on U.S. and some Canadian customers that may\nor may not be valid for other customers.\n\n1. Customers do not care about how the information is coded. (That is, unless\nthe way the information is coded causes something like printing/displaying or\ncommunication to fail. Even then, they do not care about the encoding; they\nwant to know how to fix the problem with the minimum of technical details.)\n2. Customer care about the applications that they use. 3. With respect to\ncoding, customers have these types of questions about the\napplications:\na. Are the characters I need available?\nAs Glenn said the answer is yes because Unicode/10646-1 contains the Kanji\ncharacters from the 3 Japanese standards. b. How do I enter them?\nThis is not a coding issue.\nc. Do the characters display and print correctly?\nIn Japan, this is a font issue and Japan has fonts for the JIS standard\ncharacters in Unicode/10646-1. I would presume that anyone who wants a product\nto be successful in Japan will use the Japanese fonts. Everything I have heard\nindicates that this is one of THE major issues for the Japanese.\nd. Can I correctly communicate the information in the coded characters\nto others?\nThis is a coding issue. However, as Glenn discussed, other information (such\nas the font/country) may also be required to display the correct shape for the\ncharacter.\ne. Do the characters sort correctly?\nThis is not a coding issue. It is an internationalization (I18N) issue. The\nsorting software needs to account for culturally-correct sorting.\n\nIn summary, the issue is not how the characters are coded in an application\nbut how well an application meets the customer's expectations and needs.\nUnicode and ISO/IEC 10646-1 are part of the solution to meeting customer needs\nbut meeting the customer needs requires much much more that Unicode and 10646.\n\nEd Hart\n\nFrom ISO10646@JHUVM.HCF.JHU.EDU  Wed Oct 14 14:52:29 1998\nDate:   Tue, 10 Aug 1993 11:39:18 +0200\nReply-To: Multi-byte Code Issues <ISO10646@JHUVM.HCF.JHU.EDU> Sender:\n\nMulti-byte Code Issues <ISO10646@JHUVM.HCF.JHU.EDU>\nFrom: Andr'e PIRARD <PIRARD%BLIULG11.BITNET@cunyvm.cuny.edu>\nOrganization: University of Liege (Belgium), SEGI (Computing Center)\nSubject:Re: Does Unicode satisfy Japanese market?\nTo: Multiple recipients of list ISO10646 <ISO10646@JHUVM.HCF.JHU.EDU>\n\nOn Mon, 9 Aug 1993 08:50:38 EDT Edwin Hart said:\n33.

Bewaring that communication also means mag\ntapes and CD ROMs.\n\nThe standards for data communication are the first things to consider. It's a\ntime saving to design the machine internals second, accordingly. And it's a\ntime saving to define global communication encoding standards rather than\ntackle the problem anew for each application protocol (e-mail, file transfer,\nterminal mode, database aso...).\n\nJust Latin-1 communication shows that immediate interest has been a mistake of\nthe past.\nAnd communication is now a fact.\nFor everybody, I hope.\n\n\n\nSender: John Finlayson (johnf@findog.HQ.Ileaf.COM)\n\n\nThe most common code used in Japan is Shift-JIS, which is used by\nPCs, Macs, and many workstations, although there is a trend toward\nEUC (Extended UNIX Code) on Unix.\n\nFor more info on Japanese text encoding, I recommend Ken Lunde's\njapan.inf, available (last I checked) via anonymous ftp from\nucdavis.edu (128.120.2.1) in the pub/JIS directory.\n\n\nSender: Martin \"J.\" Duerst <mduerst@ifi.unizh.ch>\n        Institute for Informatics\n        University of Zurich\n\nAs far as I have heard, the reason that the Japanese voted No has to do\nwith tecnicalities of the standardization process. It did not mean that\nUnicode was disapproved altogether by the Japanese.\nA second point is that not all Japanese are equally happy with Unicode,\nbut then, probably not all Americans share exactly the same view about\nit, either.\nWhat is more important for you is the fact that although Unicode may\nbecome the future standard all over the World (and so in Japan, too),\nit is not yet that common anywhere. Thus conversions from and to Unicode\nare a must in every Unicode product, esp. if it works in an open environment.\nThat then means that if conversion is rare, and your users are experts,\nconversion between Unicode and one of the three popular codes used\nin Japan is necessary. If conversion is frequent, and your users\nare novices, conversion to all those codes are necessary. What is esp.\nnice is a program that can detect the code of an input file.\nThe names of the codes are JIS, S-JIS (also called Shift-JIS), and EUC.\nFor more information, consult the book by Ken Lunde that will appear\nsoon (I think some preliminary information is available on the ftp server\nof insoft-l.)\n\n[Note from Jeff:\n\n     Site:      rhino.cis.vutbr.cz\n     Directory: pub/lists/insoft-l/doc/unicode\n]\n\n\nSender: Steve R.

An 18 bit extended Unicode may be coming soon to handle this,\nbut Windows-NT uses plain old 16 bit Unicode.\n\nMicrosoft plans to stick with 16 bit Unicode; people who want to use\nthe right font in mixed chinese/japanese/korean documents can bloody well\nuse RTF and select the right font themselves, is the official line.\n\nI'm trying to write a summary on the issue for the mailing list.\nMy question to you, o Windows NT expert, is: can you deduce the language in\nuse from the font?\nIs there any info in NT that associates language(s) with a font?\nThat way, you could write an Internet news or mail client that converted to\nor from 18 bit unicode on the fly.\n\nThanks for any info,\n   Dan K.\n\n\nFrom foo@bar\nSubject: Re: Windows/NT, Unicode, and the Internet\nTo: dank@alumni.cco.caltech.edu (Daniel R.

Fonts are executables with\nresources, much like resource DLLs.  Starting with NT, any resource\ncan have a language (and sublanguage) ID Associated with it.  The idea\nis to make it easy to have multi-lingual dialog boxes,etc.,  Look up\nEnumResourceLanguages() in api32wh.hlp.   Anyway, if you have fonts\nthat support this, you're in business.

Perhaps a\nbetter one is that the discussion itself is useful.  We\ngenerally don't create IETF WGs to study problems, we create\nthem with charters that contain specific objectives.  The recent\ndiscussions about 10646 and Unicode, and the eventual conclusion\nto make a MIME registration around the latter and try to gain\nenough experience that IETF can evaluate the \"needs to be\nprofiled\"/ \"doesn't need to be profiled\" debate are, IMO,\nillustrative that useful things are happening here.\n\nSo something is being done, and you, and other participants in\nthis list, are doing it.  For something to be done of a\nstandardization nature, we need:\n  -- a clear indication of need\n  -- at least the framework of a proposal\n  -- a chair (or co-chair) who can demonstrate adequate IETF\n      perspective and management skills.\n  -- an editor (or more than one)\n  -- an adequate definition of constituency.\nWe are examining, but holding, partial proposals that so far\nmeet some subset of these requirements.   Those requirements are\nnecessary conditions, but not sufficient ones.  For example,\nsince IESG tries to avoid being party to situations in which an\nidea that has been rejected by other standards bodies is carried\naround in the hope that *someone* will endorse it, a proposal\nthat had that appearance would receive additional scrutiny.\n\n   --john\n   (Wearing the Applications AD hat)\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

In JIS X 0212,\nfurther alphabets are included.\n\nEUC, developed in Japan, is considered to be a scheme to handle\nlimited-multilingual plain text. UNIX tools are modified for EUC\nand can handle bi-, tri- or more-lingual text.\n\nSo, if someone says it is not plain, we are quite confused.\n\nIt is not ununderstandale that native users of English tend to think\nthat English (more correctly speaking, basic Latin, Greek and Cyrillic\nalphabets) is special, that is, English is the only language which\nmay be mixed with other languages and still the entire bi-lingual text\nis \"plain\". But we have no reason to think so.\n\n> If they *are* \"plain text\", then one needs switching mechanisms, not\n> just \"character sets\" (in the \"code table\" sense).\n\nNo, a large code table is equivalant to switched small tables.\nUnfortunately, 16 bit space is not sufficiently large.\n\nWe, anyway, need switching mechanism to use JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212\nto encode some Japanese text with 7 bit encoding.\n\nSo, switching is not essential here.

But it is better than the combination\nof MIME charset switching and B encoding.\n\nMr. Handa may be happy to explan encoding method he used internally\non memory with MULE.\n\n                                                Masataka Ohta\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

How do I read a font from BIOS?  How does X11R6\n       support Asian keyboard input methods?)\n    3) How to work with international de jure and de facto standards for\n       representation of text, e.g. ASCII, JIS, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC, GB2312,\n       KSC5601, ISO2022, ISO10646, and Unicode, and why some standards are\n       popular in some countries & not others.\n    4) How to process text in various languages (e.g. how do you strip\n       vowels from Hebrew to get the canonical spelling?  How does one\n       sort Chinese?  What is a locale file?)\n    5) What magazines, books, and conferences deal with these issues?\n    Legal and marketing issues are not expected to be a big part of the group;\n    the intent is to help people find, write, and use non-English mono-\n    and multi-lingual software.\n\nRATIONALE (written by Dan Kegel <dank@alumni.caltech.edu>.)\n\n    WHY WE NEED THIS GROUP:  There is a pressing need for modern software\n    to be able to handle multiple languages- the user community is now\n    international- and existing forums are not adequate:\n\n    ISO10646@jhuvm.hcf.jhu.edu, an unmoderated mailing list for discussing\n    multi-byte character sets; it suffers from being a mailing list rather\n    than a newsgroup.

First of all,\nit has nothing to do with C/J/K unification.\n\nOne of my point in my ID on 10646 is that ISO 10646 (AND UNICODE)\ncan be and actually is subsetted.\n\nAccording to Keith, that 2022 is extensible does not mean full 2022\ncan be MIME charset because new unknown sets may be added. If so,\nsubsetting of UNICODE without profiling information is equally\nharmful because some set may be and is made unknown by some\nimplementation.\n\nThat is, if Japanized windows/NT receives unprofiled-Unicode text, it\nmay or may not be able to display it, because its font covers only\nabout a half of the entire 20,000 Han characters.\n\n> Ohta-san, David is proposing an experiment right now, not a\n> standards-track document.

I don't think so.\n\nDoes his charset handle Japanese? I don't think so.\n\nIf he says \"I'll handle Latin-1 characters only with UNICODE\" and\nreports \"My experiment has been successful\", it's meaning is quite\nclear.

With\nspecification about the level of use of ISO 10 646 i.e Level 1 and\nthe version of the Basic Multilingual Plane no distinction can be\nmade between Unicode and ISO 10 646, but the problem is somewhere else\nand it is similar to ISO 2022.

I can not imagine that a simple and widely used client\napplication to support all possible ISO 2022 parameters and character\nsets as I can not imagine a client application to support the whole\nBMP and all levels  of ISO 10 646 or UNICODE. So, subsetting of\nISO 10 646 is on the way and definition of object identifier for\napplications based on ASN.1 is also underway.

For voting\nquestions only contact asolovay@geoworks.com.  For questions about the\nproposed group contact Dan Kegel <dank@alumni.caltech.edu>.\n\nThe vote-taker will send a copy of each CFV to the\n<ISO10646@jhuvm.hcf.jhu.edu> (a mailing list for discussing multi-byte\ncharacter sets) and <ietf-charsets@INNOSOFT.COM> (a mailing list for\ndiscussing how to represent plain text) shortly after it is posted to\nnews.announce.newgroups. After the official RESULTs are posted, he\nwill post an abridged copy of the RESULTs (without the full list of\nvoters) to those mailing lists.\n\n\nCHARTER\n\n    The unmoderated Usenet newsgroup comp.software.international will provide a\n\n    forum to discuss software that can handle 'international', i.e.\n    non-English, text.  The encouraged topics will include\n    1) How to write, where to find, and how to use internationalized software\n    2) What hardware/operating systems support internationalized software,\n       (e.g. how do I do Asian word processing on MS-DOS/MacOS/MS-Windows-NT?\n       what hardware/operating systems are available in other countries?\n       what is DOS/V?  How do I read a font from BIOS?  How does X11R6\n       support Asian keyboard input methods?)\n    3) How to work with international de jure and de facto standards for\n       representation of text, e.g. ASCII, JIS, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC, GB2312,\n       KSC5601, ISO2022, ISO10646, and Unicode, and why some standards are\n       popular in some countries & not others.\n    4) How to process text in various languages (e.g. how do you strip\n       vowels from Hebrew to get the canonical spelling?  How does one\n       sort Chinese?  What is a locale file?)\n    5) What magazines, books, and conferences deal with these issues?\n    Legal and marketing issues are not expected to be a big part of the group;\n    the intent is to help people find, write, and use non-English mono-\n    and multi-lingual software.\n\nRATIONALE (written by Dan Kegel <dank@alumni.caltech.edu>.)\n\n    WHY WE NEED THIS GROUP:  There is a pressing need for modern software\n    to be able to handle multiple languages- the user community is now\n    international- and existing forums are not adequate:\n\n    ISO10646@jhuvm.hcf.jhu.edu, an unmoderated mailing list for discussing\n    multi-byte character sets; it suffers from being a mailing list rather\n    than a newsgroup.  Perhaps it could be gatewayed to the new group\n    for the benefit of those without Usenet access.\n\n    bit.software.international, aka insoft-l@cis.vutbr.cz, a moderated mailing\n    list with a very similar charter.  It has recently moved, but remains\n    moderated, and has a slow response time.\n\n    comp.std.internat, an unmoderated newsgroup, discusses all manner of\n    standards, and doesn't have much trafic about internationalized software.\n\n    ietf-charsets@INNOSOFT.COM, an unmoderated mailing list for discussing how\n    applications on the Internet should represent plain text.  It seems\n    to have a very small, quiet readership prone to the occasional screaming\n    fit :-)\n\nHOW TO VOTE\n\nSend MAIL to:   votes@geoworks.com\nJust Replying should work if you are not reading this on a mailing\nlist, and if your newsreader honors the \"reply-to\" line. Double-check\nthe address before sending your ballot.\n\nUse the ballot provided at the end of this CFV. Put the word \"YES\" or\n\"NO\" between the brackets before the group name. Trim your response to\njust the ballot, but make sure to send the whole ballot (i.e.\neverything between the \"=-=-=\" lines).\n\nYou may also use the word ABSTAIN in place of YES/NO - this will not\naffect the outcome.  Anything else may be rejected by the automatic\nvote counting program.  The votetaker will respond to your received\nballots with a personal acknowledgement by mail - if you do not\nreceive one within several days, try again.  It's your responsibility\nto make sure your vote is registered correctly.\n\nEach person may vote only once, no matter how many accounts he or she\nmay have. Also, only one ballot will be accepted from any account, no\nmatter how many people may share it. If more than one vote is received\nfrom any person or any account, only the last vote received will be\ncounted.\n\nAddresses and votes of all voters will be published in the final\nvoting results list. All ballots received are kept in the UVV archives\n(including \"cancelled\" and invalid ballots). The vote files are made\navailable to the moderator of news.announce.newgroups on request. They\nmay also, at the discretion of the UVV, be made more widely available\nif there is a controversy concerning the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nBALLOT:\n\n  =-=-=-=-=-=-=- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n  comp.software.international Ballot    <CSI-0002> (Don't remove this marker)\n\n  Give your real name here:\n\n   Your Vote   Group\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  [         ]  comp.software.international\n  =-=-=-=-=-=-=- Don't Delete Anything Between These Lines =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n\n\n\nBOUNCED ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe following people's EMail acknowledgements have bounced (as of\n3/31/94).

How conversion is to be done\n   is defined by means of ISO 10646 as a common interface, but\n   the actual conversion is a direct transformation from\n   source character set to target character set, not involving\n   a 10646 representation as an intermediate step. Temporary\n   files are not needed.\n\nWhat's unique in the C3 System?\n\nThe approximation table is the most innovative element in the\nC3 approach to character set conversion. It specifies for each\ncharacter in any of the character sets for which definition\ntables are given, how it is to be represented approximately\n(by fall-back) in the target character set, if the character is\n_not_ included in that character set. Several alternative\nrepresentations are specified for some characters, to take\nadvantage of the different character repertoires of different\ntarget character sets.\n\nThe conversion tables use only the invariant part of ASCII. To\nindicate other characters, the hexadecimal form of the coded\nrepresentations in UCS is used. No information specific to a\ncertain coded character set is included in the approximation\ntable.\n\nThe approximation table defines three types of conversion which\nthe user can choose from: Type 1 converts one source character\nto one target character (best for tables and fields with length\nrestrictions). Type 2 converts characters to a more\nunderstandable approximate representation, which may consists\nof one or a few target characters (best for prose). Type 3 is\na reversible one-character-to-many-characters conversion, which\nis based on the mnemonics defined by RFC 1345.\n\nThe C3 Task Force within TERENA consists of:\n\n   Borka Jerman-Blazic <jerman-blazic@ijs.si>\n   Olle Jarnefors      <ojarnef@admin.kth.se>\n   Peter Svanberg      <psv@nada.kth.se>\n   Keld Simonsen       <keld@dkuug.dk>\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Is it necessary to write an RFC to get a\nnew character set registered? Is it sufficient to do that?\n\nI'm asking these questions, since I've noticed that part 10 of\nISO 8859 is not included in the IANA registry. That standard was\npublished in 1992:\n\n   ISO/IEC 8859-10:1992(E)\n   Information technology -- 8-bit single-byte coded graphic\n      character sets -- Part 10: Latin alphabet No. 6\n   International Organization for Standardization, 1992-12-15\n\nFrom the Scope:\n\n/ This [coded character] set is suited for multiple-language\n/ applications involving Danish, English, Estonian, Finnish,\n/ German, Greenlandic, Icelandic, Sami (Lappish), Latvian,\n/ Lithuanian, Norwegian, Faroese, and Swedish.\n\nRFC 1521 _can_ be read as allowing the use of the \"ISO-8859-10\"\nvalue, even without it being included into the IANA registry:\n\n> 7.1.1.

This CEN/TC304\nworkshop will focus on solutions to this urgent language engineering task\nand on raising awareness of this need among members of the Information and\nCommunition Technology R&D community.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Background\n\nThe requirement for a detailed, intention-driven plan for the implementation\nof Character Set Technology (CST) in the European Information Society has\nbeen recognized and identified by standardizers in the public sector as well\nas by developers in the private sector. New emphasis on internationalization\nand localization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products\nhas been a welcome response to the recognition of European cultural and\nlinguistic diversity. (Internationalization deals with making software and\nnetwork services which are easily configurable to the user's own preferred\nlinguistic and cultural environment; localization is the translation and\nconfiguration of software (ideally already internationalized software) into\nlocal languages so that users may work in the linguistic environment of\ntheir choice with the application over an open network).\n\nCoordination of effort in implementation of ISO/IEC 10646 (Universal\nCharacter Set - UCS) in an internationalized environment should now be the\nmain focus of developers working in the field of CST. In this way the needs\nof small nationalities as well as of larger markets can be met, considering\nthat many language engineering projects are concerned with UCS\nimplementation but may not be taking such urgent needs into account.\n\nCEN TC304 has already contributed user requirements met by developing the\nEuropean subsets of UCS (CEN ENV 12005) that covers the repertoires of all\nindigenous languages of Europe and the standard for registration of cultural\nelements required in the information technology applications (CEN ENV 1973)\nand many more. But there are still problems to be solved. The way to do this\nis by focusing on (in no particular order):\n\n  1. Production of useful ICT standards to guide industry\n  2. Effective dissemination of requirements to public procurers\n  3. Provision by Industry of the broadest internationalization and\n     localization support possible (i.e. inclusive of minorities)\n  4. Implementation of ISO/IEC 10646, expansion of ISO/IEC 10646 for\n     European needs (e.g. historical scripts and characters)\n  5. Attention to growing and changing user requirements and to special user\n     groups (e.g. the handicapped and elderly)\n\nEurope requires the integration of all of the above into something which is\na European solutions, rather than just one of a number of a national\nsolutions. Communication of large amounts of textual information, rapid\ntranslation of electronic messages, access to multilingual databases,\nmultilingual user interfaces, multilingual help facilities, multilingual\ngrammar and style checkers, machine identification of travel documents etc.\nare all a part of this.\n\nThe new environment which will be brought to the European users implies\ndevelopment of new character repertoire solutions and a clear migration\nstrategy for the current existing solutions and equipment. It is a new\nchallenge to the standardization community concerned with\ninternationalisation of ICT and CST in Europe.\n\nThe workshop organized by CEN Technical Committee TC304 will endeavour to\nclarify and discuss the direction of CST and internationalization\nimplementations and the design and development of such implementations. The\ncontext is European: the infrastructure for multi-lingual communication\nservices and ICT products on which the European Single Market depends. This\nworkshop will be a forum for the exchange of information and requirements by\nstandardizers and by researchers and developers in industry. It will\nreinforce the links with the ICT R&D community in Europe and will be\nrelevant to consortia participating in the Fourth Framework.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Who should attend\n\nWe welcome participants from all over Europe and other with similar\nproblems. We welcome users and implementors, public procures, end users,\nlinguists, manufacturers, standardizers and everybody that can help solve\nthe problems n implement the right standards. At least the following\norganizations will be invited:\n\n   * National Standards organizations (members of CEN)\n   * Members of ETSI and EWOS\n   * Public procurers: members of SOGITS and PPG\n   * Individual experts from standardization committees: ISO/IEC/JTC1/SCs,\n     ECMA, EWOS, ETSI, CENELEC\n   * End users: Language committes, ETSI/HF, Ergonomy/disability inst. and\n     TCs\n   * Applications: Bibliographers (ISO/46), terminologists (ISO/37), EDIFACT\n     (WE-EB), etc.\n   * CEC (DGIII, DGXIII, INFO 2000, END, IDA, Language Engineering),\n     CEN/TC224, CEN/TC225\n   * Producers: ECMA, Unicode, EUREKA/AV, other ICT companies\n   * User organizations: CECUA , ECTUA, SHARE, DECUS, EurOpen\n   * Service providers: TERENA, PTTs, SPIRIT, EUNet\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Scope\n\nThe aim is to discuss all obstacles and problems in the European way towards\ninformation society with rich cultural diversity. The aim is also to achieve\nbetter relationships and broad contacts for exchange of information between\nstandards developers, implementors, and users. We have identified the user\nneeds -- now we must give guidance toward realizing those needs. Working\ntogether with industry, standardizers can influence development as well as\ncreate real standards -- not just de-facto market standards -- ensuring\ncloser and better European ICT cohesion, helping to solve problems of\nmultilingual support within the European Community, the European Information\nSociety, and worldwide. ISO 10646, the Universal Character Set, provides the\npotential for representing all of Europe's written languages on everyone's\nmachines, both at home and at work, and is key to the successful\nimplementation of ICT requirements in Europe.\n\nThe main benefit of this workshop will be to raise the awareness among the\nparticipants of work which is ongoing or incipient, so that they can look\nfor it, recommend it to others, and press their local and international\nsuppliers for it. An example: if Slovenians learn that there is a new\ninternationalization API and European registry for cultural elements and\nspecifications, they can demand the correct implementation of their\ncharacter set, date and time formats, and keyboards of their local hardware\nand software vendors, who may either implement them locally or request them\nof a parent company. In particular, the workshop will discuss at least the\nfollowing questions:\n\n   * How can the obstacles to effective multi-lingual exchange of data be\n     overcome?\n   * How should the requirements regarding Character Set support be\n     implemented?????\n\n   * How will this meet the needs of translation offices?\n   * How is industry implementing text-oriented services and software?\n   * Where can standards solve the problems?\n   * How can we make up the deficiencies within existing standards?\n   * How do standards committees cooperate better?\n   * How can we ensure that industry use standardization expertise (rather\n     than ignoring everything but the market)?\n   * Which CST standards will be needed by future IT-applications?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Call for proposals\n\nUsers and implementors, public procures, end users, linguists,\nmanufacturers, standardizers are all invited to submit 1/2 page abstract\nwith topics relevant to the workshop scope.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Language\n\nThe language of the Workshop will be English.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Accomodation\n\nThe moderate price accomodation is organised.\n\n            Rooms incl. breakfast            Price in DEM\n\n  Grand hotel Toplice\n\n  - twinbedded lakeview                          180\n\n  - twinbedded lakeview - single occupancy       150\n\n  - twinbedded                                   150\n\n  - single lakeview                              120\n\n  - single                                       100\n\n  Annex hotel Jadran\n\n  - single lakeview                               80\n\n  Annex hotel Trst\n\n  - single lakeview                               80\n\n  - single                                        70\n\n  Supplement for half board per person/day\n  (minimum 3 days)                                30\n\nYou can book now already in\n\nGrand Hotel Toplice\n4260 Bled\nSlovenia\nTel.: + 386 64 7910\nFax : + 386 64 741 841\nEmail: toplicebl@perftech.si\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Practical Information\n\nBled is about 50 km NW from the capital Ljubljana, and 32 km NW from\nLjubljana Airport.\n\n                                 Travel Maps and more information\n                      Look at URL\n                   http://www.e5.ijs.si/i18n/ws-bled.html\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Important dates\n\n 30.6.1996    Submission of abstract\n\n 30.9.1996    Acknowledgment of acceptance\n\n 31.10.1996   Full papers\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Fee\n\n60 ECU for early registration and payment before October 11\n80 ECU after October 11\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Registration information\n\nPlease fill in the Registration form :\n\nFirst Name :\nLast/Family Name :\nTitle :\nCompany/Organization :\nStreet Address :\nCity :\nState :\nZip/Postal Code :\nCountry :\nTelephone :\nFax :\nE-Mail Address :\nDo you plan to submit  paper: No Yes\nTitle of paper :\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        Additional information\n\nSpecific questions regarding the workshop may be directed to:\nWSTC304@e5.ijs.si\n\nor\n\nBorka Jerman-Blazic\nIJS\nJamova 39\n1000 Ljubljana\nSlovenia\nTel.: + 386 61 1773 408\nFax : + 386 123 21 18\nEmail: borka@e5.ijs.si\n\nor\n\nTorvardur Kari Olafsson\nIcelandic Council for Standardization (STR\u00cd)\nKeldnaholt\nIS-112 Reykjavik\nIceland\nTel.: + 354 587 7000\nFax : + 354 587 7409\nEmail : tobbi@iti.is\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Larry,\nGlenn, et al can attest to that.  I share some of your viewpoints, although\nnot all of them.\n\nI also see the other side of this issue.  Han unification is more than \"fit\neverything in 16 bits\"; there are benefits gained from it as well as\ncapabilities lost.  For this reason, I think that the only way to move forward\nis to strike a compromise.\n\nA compromise requires amelioration of the problems so that we can all get\nsomething that works.  This does mean sensitizing the Unicoders to some of the\nreal problems that are faced by us in the plaintext world (and doing so\nrepeatedly).  But we, in turn, must also be sensitized to their problems.\n\nAnd remember:\n        ISO 10646 is definitely not the best universal coded character set;\n        it's the *only* universal coded character set.\n\nUnicode has abundant warts.  Han unification is only one of them.  But\nwhenever you find warts, you will find people who will call those warts\n\"features\".  Whether something is a \"wart\" or a \"feature\" is a matter of\nopinion; and in 40 years I've learned that opinions are like anuses; everyone\nhas one.\n\nIt's pointless to discuss something that\n        (1) is a matter of opinion\n        (2) no concensus is possible\n        (3) is completely unnecessary to come to concensus.\nWe can all keep our opinions, and still come up with a technical spec that\nworks.\n\nIn your paper at Tsukuba, you defined plaintext as \"text with finite state\nstructure\".  I'm not convinced that ISO 2022 based solutions, such as your\nproposal (ISO-2022-JP2 or ISO-2022-INT), are any more \"finite state\" than an\nISO 10646 based solution with \"language tags\" (I'm putting this term in quotes\ndeliberately, see below).\n\nI am, however, convinced that an ISO 10646 based solution must have a\nreversible mapping with ISO-2022-JP2.  It is obvious that raw Unicode is not\nsufficient for this purpose.  \"Language tags\" is a misnomer; we actually are\nnot shifting languages, we are shifting through various alternate glyphs for a\nparticular character.  Kobayashi-san from Justsystem suggests \"source ID\",\nalthough this too many have nomenclature problems.\n\nLet's not bother with what they are called, and for the time being let's call\nthem \"blurdybloops\" instead.\n\nSo, what is the definition of a \"blurdybloop\"?  This is not a trivial problem.\nKobayashi-san proposed three to start (one for each of C, J, and K).  I think\nthat we need more than three, but I also that the total number of blurdybloops\nis probably less than 25.\n\nDo you think that you can help us with this definition?  You have considerable\ntalent and knowledge of East Asian language issues, and I think that you could\nhelp enormously if you wanted to.\n\nWould you please help?\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

In fact, when we send out 10,000 marketing letters\n each day, it doesn't take long before we're completely swamped with\n e-mail inquiries and phone calls. This is very easy to do. And each\n one of these bulk mailings costs us nothing. We can teach you how to\n do this and provide you with the tools you'll need.\n\n If you've got a good marketing letter we'll show you how to open the\n floodgates.  You'll be deluged with inquiries, leads, and real sales,\n using nothing but e-mail alone.\n\n Writing a good marketing letter takes time.  We often have to rewrite\n our marketing letters a half dozen times before we get the results we're\n looking for.  But once you have a good letter, as you probably know,\n you can use the same letter over and over again, predictably and\n consistently, closing sales, week after week, month after month.\n\n It takes us about one hour to send our marketing letter to 30,000 fresh\n e-mail address using the Floodgate package.  If you're interested in\n electronic marketing, you should know about this software.\n\n THE PROGRAM: FLOODGATE FOR WINDOWS\n\n The Floodgate Bulk Email Loader imports simple text files that\n anyone can download from any online service* or the internet.\n These text files contain classified ads, forum messages, or data\n from the member directory.  Each of these files is filled with\n e-mail addresses.\n\n Floodgate is designed to read these files and strip out the e-mail\n addresses.  It then sorts the addresses, removes any duplicates, and\n formats them into an output file.  This is all done in one simple step.\n Just point and click.\n\n You'll need either a Windows based Internet account or an online-service\n account to send out your marketing letters.  Most online services or\n internet providers charge nothing to send e-mail.  Send your letter to\n 10,000 people or 100,000 people - the cost is always the same.  Nothing!\n\n The Floodgate Users Guide will teach you, step by step, how to\n download the right files, how to strip the addresses, and finally\n how to send your marketing letter to thosands of recipients FOR FREE.\n Once you've done it a few times you won't even have to think.\n It's that simple.\n\n FOR THE BRAVE & DARING: PUSHING TECHNOLOGY TO ITS LIMITS\n\n About 1 in 100 will write back and tell us, \"take me off your list\",\n which we can do, thanks to Floodgate's \"remove list\" feature.  Many\n people reply back thanking us for sending them our informative letter.\n That's always nice. Most people though, just reply and say, \"send\n more info.\"  In this way it usually takes us another email or phone\n call to close a sale.\n\n The Floodgate Users Guide will provide you with three proven formats\n for writing a successful marketing letter.  You'll test and rewrite,\n test and rewrite.  Then, once you've got it, just push a few buttons\n and open the floodgates!!!\n\n THE FLOODGATE BULK EMAIL LOADER CURRENTLY SUPPORT 12 FILE FORMATS which\n will enable you to build email databases from all the major online services\n and the internet:\n\n BUILD REUSABLE MASTER FILES\n\n Floodgate maintains Master Files for each of your marketing letters.\n If you download from the same place on a regular basis, you only want\n to send your letter to the new people.  Floodgate will compare the\n new addresses with those in the Master File, and prepare a mailing\n list of only new people.  The new addresses are, of course, then\n added to the Master File.  With each new mailing your Master File\n grows and grows.\n\n You may create as many Master Lists as you need.  When you start a new\n marketing campaign you'll want to send your new letter to everyone on\n your Master List.  If you write a newsletter, each time you send your\n newsletter, you'll send it to everyone on a Master List.\n\n Floodgate now directly writes distribution lists\n that are compatible with all of the popular emailing\n programs. Take one of your Master Files, press a few\n buttons, and prepare a mailing of 50,000+ in less than\n five minutes, without cutting and pasting!\n\n THE REMOVE LIST\n\n When people reply and tell you to take them off your\n mailing list, place these addresses in the REMOVE.TXT file and they\n will never receive another letter from you again.  In this way you\n will be operating your business with the most professionalism\n possible.\n\n HOW ARE WE BETTER THAN THE COMPETITION?\n\n We have some new competitors that have tried to copy Floodgate.  The\n following list describes why floodgate is BETTER...\n\n ** Floodgate is a mature, bug free product; Not an initial release.\n ** Floodgate comes with over 100 pages of step by step documentation.\n ** Floodgate is the only one offering a money back guarantee.\n ** Floodgate has more testimonials (ourselves included!)\n ** Filter for filter, Floodgate offers more capabilities, way more.\n ** Floodgate does everything all the others *combined* claim.\n ** Floodgate is by far the easiest to use.\n ** There is NO *cutting and pasting* with Floodgate.\n\n Floodgate has everything! The documentation shows you where to go and where\n not to go, what to do and how to do it.\n\n\n EASY TO INSTALL AND EASY TO LEARN\n\n The Floodgate Email Loader requires Windows. It's easy to install,\n and it's a cinch to learn.\n\n Floodgate has previously sold for as much as $2499.95.  If you order\n within the next 72 hours, the complete package is now available for\n just $349.95.\n\n Compared to direct mail, where you pay for mailing lists,\n printing and postage, Floodgate is a bargain. For the cost\n of one traditional mailing, you'll own a Floodgate license\n and never again pay for lists, printing or postage.  Those\n who know direct mail agree, \"Floodgate is the best\n advertising value on the Internet today!\"\n\n Floodgate will pay for itself in a few days.  It will also cut\n your advertising costs down to almost nothing.  Think of what the\n competition will do when they get their Floodgate program.  Don't be left\n in the dust - there are 75 million people out there, just a few keystrokes\n away.  Let's do the math:\n\n - Email 50,000 sales letters (takes a couple of hours)\n - Let's say your product will bring you $20 profit per sale\n - Let's also say you only get a 1% response (usually higher)\n\n * That's 500 orders x $20 = $10,000 profit !!

If so, this is for\nyou. Let me tell you a little about myself. I established my\nbusiness in 1995. After marketing over 20 products very successfully\non-line, I am releasing the Biggest Secret to On-Line Marketing.\nEvery minute of the day 7 new people log on-line. That's 10,080\npeople per day! Is that unbelievable or what? Do you know what that\nmeans? That's 10,080 new business prospects per day! There are over\n55 MILLION prospects waiting for you right now! By the end of '97\nthere is expected to be over 165 MILLION people on-line! As you can\nsimply tell, there is no end to this. Let's face it. There are many\nlarge companies investing MILLIONS of dollars per day on the Internet,\nand for one reason only. They know this is where their business is\ngoing to be by the year 2000. Marketing on-line can be a very\ndifficult task, but it doesn't have to be. That's where I come in. I\nhave put together an unbelievable marketing package together for you\nthat nobody can even come close to.\n\nDon't be fooled by these people telling you that you need Floodgate\nand other similar programs to send bulk mail- it's a lie. Floodgate only\nextracts the addresses. That can be VERY time consuming and costly.\nThey make it sound so easy, and when in reality, it's not. I'll put it this\nway- to even get one million e-mail addresses with Floodgate, it would\ntake you at least 6 months.\n\nYou may ask yourself, \"How can he get so many addresses?\"\nI have been marketing on the Internet for over one year now. All of\nthese E-mail addresses have been collected within the past month and a\nhalf! I have the experience and knowledge to know where and how to\nobtain the addresses quickly. I also receive them from some of the\nlargest ISP's in the country.\n\nThere are other SO-CALLED companies that will claim to give you\n2 to 5 MILLION ADDRESSES- and they lie! They will only give you\n2 to 4 HUNDERED THOUSAND!! When you receive them, they're\nall scrambled up and half of the addresses aren't even valid. They have\ndates, they are put in many different formats, and extra characters are\nadded on the end of them, so they won't even be sent. You will get 3/4 of\nthe mail back as UNDELIVERABLE, which means the computer can't\neven send them! Don't be RIPPED OFF by these people.\n\nAlso, I have made it as easy as possible for you. I have put them ALL\nin a Pegasus Mailing List for you!!! You will also receive a copy of Pegasus\nMail, if you don't have it. Then, all you have to do is click 3 BUTTONS and\nthey will be sent. This is as easy as it gets! They have all been tested and\nthey are DELIVERABLE, which means they will all go through. I am selling\nthe WHOLE 2 MILLION E-Mail database for only $69.95! If you're asking\nyourself, \"Why is he only selling them for $69.95 when he has a good list, and\nthese OTHER COMPANIES are selling them for $149.00 to $500.00, and\ntheir lists are poorly put together?\" The answer is simply, \"I believe in\nproducing high quality work that should be priced reasonably.\" With this\nE-Mail List, I will also include a \"Step by Step Guide\" that will show\nyou everything you need to know to send your E-Mail out. It's very easy and\nanybody can do it. So if you have a computer, use it to make money.\n\nJust imagine E-mailing 2 MILLION people. That's like sending 2 MILLION\nletters at .32 cents PER STAMP!!! Can you imagine if you only had a 1%\nresponse rate? That's still 20,000 ORDERS! All you have to do is take your\nidea and GO!! Many people have no idea about the power of the Internet.\n\nYou can make this work to your advantage and I'll show you how. I can\nalmost GUARANTEE you that you will never see another offer like this, so\nact now. The $69.95 is nothing compared to the money you will make from\nthe list. You'll make the $69.95 back in your first mailing.\n\nHere's Everything You'll Receive:\n\n2 MILLION E-MAIL ADDRESSES\n\nComplete Setup Instructions\n\nA Copy Of Pegasus Mail For Win3.X, Win95 or Mac\n\n   As a Special Bonus, if you order within the next 10 days, I'll give you\na 175 page, E-Book called, \" Your Personal Complete Guide To The Internet.\n\" It covers every aspect of the Internet from Advanced E-mail to Veronica\nand shows you how to get full use from the Internet.

I'll be brief and\nI'll get right to the point.\n\nEveryday, I am searching out ways to make more money and\nfor ways to help others make more money. I do this because\nI believe if can help you better live the kind of life that\nyour heart desires, I will be in a better position to live\nthe kind of life that my heart desires. In other words,\nYour Success Is My Success!\n\nThe reason I am writing you this e-mail today is, I believe\nthat I have found something that everyone from around the\nworld can easily make money with and that almost everyone\nwill be able to afford to join.\n\nI know these are bold words, but they are true. The main\nchallenge for me has always been to find money making\nopportunities that are fun, simple, and easy to do where\npeople are already making money. Another challenge has\nbeen to find money making opportunities that have a low\nstart up fee and no monthly fee and that people from all\nover the world can participate in and profit from.\n\nToday, I am sending you this e-mail to let you know that I\nhave found such a company and a way for each of us to\nachieve all of the above objectives.\n\nHere's What I'm Talking About\n*****************************\n\nRecently I heard about a man who is currently earning over\n$70,000.00 a month in his home based business.\n\nObviously, I wanted to know how he was doing it because\nearning over $70,000.00 a month is something I would like\nto do from home and I am sure you would like to as well.\n\nAfter talking with an associate of his, I found out how he\nis doing it and more importantly, I found out how you, me,\nand anyone else who is serious can do it as well.\n\nWhat he did was, he bought the full reprint rights to the\n\"Hottest Selling Report In The World Today\" for a one time\nout of pocket expense of $50.00. If you want to do this,\n$50.00 is all it will cost you to buy the full reprint rights\nto this report as well. I will tell you more about this in\na minute.\n\nThis report contains very valuable information that everyone\nin the world wants and needs. This report will change people's\nlives throughout the world by showing them how they can make\nand save money by removing themselves from the strict rules,\nregulations and tax burdens their government has imposed on\nthem.\n\nThe information on this report is not accessible just anywhere.\nInformation like this can not be found at your local library.\nIt is well worth the $50.00 - In fact it's well worth thousands\nof dollars by showing people how they can save a hundred times\nthat amount in taxes alone.\n\nNow you can see why it is the \"Hottest Selling Report In The\nWorld Today.\n\nHere's How He Is Earning Over $70,000.00 A Month\n************************************************\n\nHe runs small classified ads, he sends out faxes and mails out\npostcards to get people to want to call, fax or mail him to\nreceive a free information letter. This letter tells them all\nthe details and it gets them to want to buy the report from\nhim.\n\nThe free information letter does all the work for him and it\nwill do all the work for you and me to. All we have to do is\nget people interested to want to get the free information\nletter and the letter will do the selling for us.\n\nOne of the things that got me real excited about this is that\nneither he nor anyone else that I know of is marketing this\nvery valuable inexpensive report on the Internet. We will be.\nIn addition to using the Internet, we will be able to duplicate\nthe ways that he has already been successfully marketing it.\nThis is a no brainer.\n\nBy the way, the report itself contains the ads he is running,\nthe postcard he is using, the free information letter he uses\nand more information that will help you market it. Plus, you\nwill have the e-mail letters and auto responder that I have\nset up to use to market this as well.\n\nBy doing the above he is selling over 1,400 copies of this\nvaluable inexpensive report a month for $50.00 a copy. This\nis how he is earning over $70,000.00 a month and this is how\nyou, me and anyone else who is serious can do the same thing.\n\nWhat he does, after people read the free information letter who\nwant to buy the report is, he has them send him $50.00, he then\nsends them priority mail a copy of the report which he bought\nwhen he started for a one time cost of $50.00. He makes $50.00\nevery time someone orders the report, less the cost of printing\nand mailing which is about $5.00.\n\nThat's it! He does this over and over and over again. Month in\nand month out. That is all he does and that is all you and me\nhave to do. Except, we have the Internet and the tools to market\nthis to more people world wide than anyone else ever has.\n\nLet Me Briefly Recap\n********************\n\n* This man is earning over $70,000.00 a month in his home based\nbusiness\n* He bought full reprint rights to The \"Hottest Selling Report\nIn The World Today\" for $50.00\n* He uses a proven system, running small classified ads,\nsending out faxes, and mailing postcards to get people to\nwant to receive the free information letter so they can get the\ndetails to decide if they are interested or not\n* The letter does all the explaining and selling for him\n* People send him $50.00 for a copy and for full reprint rights\nto this valuable inexpensive report that is worth way more than\nwhat they paid for it\n* He has his printer make a copy of the report which he paid\n$50.00 for and he mails it out to them priority mail\n* That's it. He does it over and over and over again, month in\nand month out\n\nHere's Where You Come In\n************************\n\nYou, me and anyone else anywhere in the world, can do the same\nthing this man is doing. Plus, we can use the Internet and all\nthe tools we have to talk to more people.\n\nObviously, I have no idea if this will be of any interest to you\nor not.

I'll be brief and\nI'll get right to the point.\n\nEveryday, I am searching out ways to make more money and\nfor ways to help others make more money. I do this because\nI believe if can help you better live the kind of life that\nyour heart desires, I will be in a better position to live\nthe kind of life that my heart desires. In other words,\nYour Success Is My Success!\n\nThe reason I am writing you this e-mail today is, I believe\nthat I have found something that everyone from around the\nworld can easily make money with and that almost everyone\nwill be able to afford to join.\n\nI know these are bold words, but they are true. The main\nchallenge for me has always been to find money making\nopportunities that are fun, simple, and easy to do where\npeople are already making money. Another challenge has\nbeen to find money making opportunities that have a low\nstart up fee and no monthly fee and that people from all\nover the world can participate in and profit from.\n\nToday, I am sending you this e-mail to let you know that I\nhave found such a company and a way for each of us to\nachieve all of the above objectives.\n\nHere's What I'm Talking About\n*****************************\n\nRecently I heard about a man who is currently earning over\n$70,000.00 a month in his home based business.\n\nObviously, I wanted to know how he was doing it because\nearning over $70,000.00 a month is something I would like\nto do from home and I am sure you would like to as well.\n\nAfter talking with an associate of his, I found out how he\nis doing it and more importantly, I found out how you, me,\nand anyone else who is serious can do it as well.\n\nWhat he did was, he bought the full reprint rights to the\n\"Hottest Selling Report In The World Today\" for a one time\nout of pocket expense of $50.00. If you want to do this,\n$50.00 is all it will cost you to buy the full reprint rights\nto this report as well. I will tell you more about this in\na minute.\n\nThis report contains very valuable information that everyone\nin the world wants and needs. This report will change people's\nlives throughout the world by showing them how they can make\nand save money by removing themselves from the strict rules,\nregulations and tax burdens their government has imposed on\nthem.\n\nThe information on this report is not accessible just anywhere.\nInformation like this can not be found at your local library.\nIt is well worth the $50.00 - In fact it's well worth thousands\nof dollars by showing people how they can save a hundred times\nthat amount in taxes alone.\n\nNow you can see why it is the \"Hottest Selling Report In The\nWorld Today.\n\nHere's How He Is Earning Over $70,000.00 A Month\n************************************************\n\nHe runs small classified ads, he sends out faxes and mails out\npostcards to get people to want to call, fax or mail him to\nreceive a free information letter. This letter tells them all\nthe details and it gets them to want to buy the report from\nhim.\n\nThe free information letter does all the work for him and it\nwill do all the work for you and me to. All we have to do is\nget people interested to want to get the free information\nletter and the letter will do the selling for us.\n\nOne of the things that got me real excited about this is that\nneither he nor anyone else that I know of is marketing this\nvery valuable inexpensive report on the Internet. We will be.\nIn addition to using the Internet, we will be able to duplicate\nthe ways that he has already been successfully marketing it.\nThis is a no brainer.\n\nBy the way, the report itself contains the ads he is running,\nthe postcard he is using, the free information letter he uses\nand more information that will help you market it. Plus, you\nwill have the e-mail letters and auto responder that I have\nset up to use to market this as well.\n\nBy doing the above he is selling over 1,400 copies of this\nvaluable inexpensive report a month for $50.00 a copy. This\nis how he is earning over $70,000.00 a month and this is how\nyou, me and anyone else who is serious can do the same thing.\n\nWhat he does, after people read the free information letter who\nwant to buy the report is, he has them send him $50.00, he then\nsends them priority mail a copy of the report which he bought\nwhen he started for a one time cost of $50.00. He makes $50.00\nevery time someone orders the report, less the cost of printing\nand mailing which is about $5.00.\n\nThat's it! He does this over and over and over again. Month in\nand month out. That is all he does and that is all you and me\nhave to do. Except, we have the Internet and the tools to market\nthis to more people world wide than anyone else ever has.\n\nLet Me Briefly Recap\n********************\n\n* This man is earning over $70,000.00 a month in his home based\nbusiness\n* He bought full reprint rights to The \"Hottest Selling Report\nIn The World Today\" for $50.00\n* He uses a proven system, running small classified ads,\nsending out faxes, and mailing postcards to get people to\nwant to receive the free information letter so they can get the\ndetails to decide if they are interested or not\n* The letter does all the explaining and selling for him\n* People send him $50.00 for a copy and for full reprint rights\nto this valuable inexpensive report that is worth way more than\nwhat they paid for it\n* He has his printer make a copy of the report which he paid\n$50.00 for and he mails it out to them priority mail\n* That's it. He does it over and over and over again, month in\nand month out\n\nHere's Where You Come In\n************************\n\nYou, me and anyone else anywhere in the world, can do the same\nthing this man is doing.

However, Internet mail\n(STD 11, RFC 822) currently supports only 7-bit US ASCII as a character\nset. MIME (RFC 1521 and RFC 1522) extends Internet mail to support\ndifferent media types and character sets, and thus could support Unicode\nin\nmail messages. MIME neither defines Unicode as a permitted character set\nnor specifies how it would be encoded, although it does provide for the\nregistration of additional character sets over time.\n\nThis document describes a transformation format of Unicode that contains\nonly 7-bit ASCII characters and is intended to be readable by humans\nin the limiting case that the document consists of characters from\nthe US-ASCII repertoire. It also specifies how this transformation\nformat is used in the context of MIME and RFC 1641, \"Using Unicode\nwith MIME\".\n\nInternet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.

Even the IAB charset workshop report\n(draft-weider-iab...) recognizes that.\n\n>UTF-7 Definition\n\n>   A UTF-7 stream represents 16-bit Unicode characters in 7-bit US-ASCII\n>   as follows:\n\nSugg.: \"represents ... using 7-bit ASCII-valued octets as follows\"\n\n>      Unicode is encoded using Modified Base64 by first converting\n>      Unicode 16-bit quantities to an octet stream (with the most\n>      significant octet first).

In other contexts, straight\n   Unicode or UTF-8 is preferred.\n\n\nUTF-7 would work very nice with 8-bit transports, for example when sending\ne-mail and using charset=iso-8859-1; content-transfer-encoding=8bit\nallowing all 8-bits to be used giving an easy to read text of the\n8bit character set and still allowing all UCS-2 characters to be used.\n\nMost 8-bit character sets should be able to use it allowing them to\nstill be readable and compact without removing the possiblity to include\nall UCS-2 characters.

And could be used for other character sets than UCS.\n\nIt looks like this to many people. But it is in no way intended\nto be a content-encoding. Just look at what the accronym means:\nUCS Transfer Format, where UCS is Universal Character Set.\nThe same applies for UTF-8 and UTF-16.\n\n\n> But even if is is restricted to UCS is would work fine to use:\n\n> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-7\n> Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n\n\n> and only encode characters that can not be represented by 8 bits.\n\nWould work fine, eh? Who's going to figure out what the 8-bit\ncharacters are, and how? And then also something like\n\n\nwould have to mean something (because iso-2022-jp is a pure\n7-bit encoding).

(i.e. iso 8859-1)\n\nDan - You came up with the idea to call ISO-8859-1 UCS-1.\nPlease note that this is purely your idea, and that there\nis no standard that uses such a terminology or forsees such\nusage. And people with a wide global perspective don't think\nabout iso-8859-1 as something that could be called \"of course\".\n\nIn the same vein, we could call ASCII UCS-1 (well,\nexactly it would have to be UCS-0.875 :-), but that is\ndefinitely not intended. Also note that UCS stands for\nUniversal Character Set. Apart from the question of whether\nwe are the only writing species in the universe, UCS-2\n(the BMP) is pretty much universal. ISO-8859-1 definitely\ndoes not deserve to be called universal.\n\n\n> > And then also something like\n> >     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp\n> >     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n> > would have to mean something (because iso-2022-jp is a pure\n> > 7-bit encoding).

It's not what MIME suggests to do, but it is\nacceptable. It is also acceptable for \"charset=UTF-7\".\nWhat is not acceptable is to suddenly try to fill in stuff\ninto character encodings (\"charset\"s) that are purely\n7-bit, as you have proposed above. If somebody things that\nwe need a UCS-7 form that is compatible (more or less) with\niso-8859-1, then with equal legitimation, there are many other\nlegacy encodings that could use such a combination. But as\nUTF-7 already encodes all of UCS-2, and the relevant portions\nof UCS-4, there is no need for such strange combinations.\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

In reality, AIR is what makes it\npossible for us the hit the ball as far as we do.  The SPIN we impart\non a ball actually gives the ball lift, much like the wing on an\naircraft imparts lift.  This lift makes it possible for the ball to\nstay airborne longer, enabling it to travel further.\n\nIn a vacuum, the average 250 yard drive would only travel about 180\nyards.  A winged aircraft would not fly.\n\nAir is your Friend....::))\n\nNow here's one for you......Does a ball fly farther on a hot dry day\nor cold wet day??....How about a hot humid day or a cold dry day ?\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nGolfballs Unlimited USA reclaims balls from over 130 courses in 13\nstates.  We stock over 50 varieties of balls.  If you're an average\nplayer, by the time you have played 3 holes with a new ball, you are\nplaying with a ball that's in much worse condition than our premium\nballs.\n\nWe offer the highest possible quality recycled balls available...at\ndirect pricing....HUGE SAVINGS over new balls.  Yes we have BALATAS.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction Is Absolutely Guaranteed.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a price sheet.\n\nRegards,\n\nDana Jones\nThe Ballman\n\nps..I have worked carefully to see that this information goes only to\nthose who may have an interest.

Let's either restrict access to the list, or shut it down.\n\nAs I have pointed out before, this isn't possible. This is an IETF list\nintended for discussion of character set issues -- a highly political area to\nbegin with. IETF discussions are supposed to be open to all comers, including\npeople not subscribed to the list. I am not going to open myself up to a charge\nthat I've unfairly restricted IETF discussions. Simply put, I don't want to be\nsued. (And if you don't think this is a possibility or you think that having\nthe list be open to all subscribers is sufficient, you're simply out of touch\nwith present-day IETF realities.)\n\nIf someone wants to suggest a mechanism other than limiting postings to\nsubscribers, I'm all ears. Thus far nobody has. We already have site and\naddress filters in place to deal with sites and specific addresses that have\nspammed this list. Unfortunately, this list keeps getting hit from new\naddresses  -- my records show that the only site that has repeatedly spammed\nthis list in recent times is econopromo.com, and they only got to do it three\ntimes as a result of my not getting the rules set up correctly. In addition,\nthis list seems to get spam that none of the other lists here seem to get,\nmaking screening on the basis of multiple posts impossible.\n\nShutting down the list would seem to be an option, were it not for the fact\nthat meaningful discussions have in fact taken place as little as a month ago\n(thus disproving the \"nothing but spam\" assertion, BTW).\n\nAs such, I have no useful suggestion other than to live with the spams on this\nlist. Again, if someone wants to suggest some other course of action I've not\nconsidered, I'm all ears.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Thus, if you set up a filter that screens out any\nmail not To: or Cc: \"ietf-charsets@innosoft.com\", I believe that should screen\nout most spam while allowing \"normal\" mail to come in unrestricted.\n\nDoes this sound workable?\n\n\n    Walter Ian Kaye <boo@best.com>     Programmer - Excel, AppleScript,\n          Mountain View, CA                         ProTERM, FoxPro, HTML\n http://www.natural-innovations.com/     Musician - Guitarist, Songwriter\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It has demonstrated and proven ability to generate\nlarge sums of money. This program is showing fantastic appeal\nwith a huge and ever growing population which needs additional\nincome. IT WILL WORK FOR YOU (don't let this slip through your\nfingers like I almost did) if you CAREFULLY FOLLOW the simple\ninstructions and apply these next four points:\n\n(1) INSIGHT: It is necessary to see the GREAT possibilities that\nthis marketing program contains. READ IT SEVERAL TIMES, then\nlater read it again! Calculate the numbers for yourself; you will\nsee the amazing results that can be obtained.\n\n(2) INVESTMENT: Not in me, or anyone else, but in yourself. Every\nendeavor which produces a profit requires some degree of\ninvestment, be it time, money, resources, etc. For the potential\ngain that can come to you, this investment is quite\ninsignificant.\n\n(3) APPLICATION: There is no such thing as a \"FREE LUNCH\". Even\nthis opportunity requires some effort and time. Every successful\nventure does.\n\n(4) PATIENCE: After you have accomplished the steps described,\nthe program requires a little time before showing a good\nresponse. As it enters the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and finally the 4th\nlevel of response, there is a time element that to some could be\na bit aggravating without giving proper thought to *how* the\nprogram works, AND IT DOES WORK! You must allow 20 to 90 days...\nso be patient! \"ALL THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT!\"\n\n   This is a LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, money-making opportunity. It does\nnot require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work,\nand best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get\nthe mail. Your orders come and are filled THROUGH THE MAIL, so\nyou are not involved in personal selling.  You do it privately in\nyour own home, store or office.\n\n   If you believe that someday you will get that lucky break you\nhave been waiting for, THIS IS IT! Simply follow the easy\ninstructions in the next part of this message, and your dream\nwill come true! This multi-level mail order marketing program\nworks perfectly... 100% EVERY TIME.\n\n   Multi-level marketing is a respected way to sell goods and\nservices. It is taught at the Harvard Business School. Of the\n500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made their fortune\nin the last several years in MLM. Current statistics show 45\npeople become millionaires every day through Multi-Level\nMarketing. There is great opportunity here - if you find the\nright program. And this one works.\n\n   Thousands of people have used this program to raise capital to\nstart their own business, pay off debts, buy homes, cars, etc.,\neven retire! This is your chance, so don't pass it up... I cannot\nstress this enough! FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY, and in 20 to\n90 days you could receive upwards of $50,000. Let's face it, the\nprofits are worth it! THEY'RE TREMENDOUS!!! So go for it.\nRemember the 4 points and we'll see you at the top!\n\n\n                         I N S T R U C T I O N S\n                         =======================\n\nFollow these easy steps to achieve maximum results:\n\n  In the MULTI-LEVEL MAIL ORDER MARKETING BUSINESS, we have a\nmethod of raising capital that works 100% every time! I am sure\nthat you could use $50,000 to $125,000 in the next 20 to 90 days.\nBefore you say \"NO WAY\", PLEASE STUDY THIS PROGRAM CAREFULLY.\n\n  THIS IS *NOT* A CHAIN LETTER, but a legal, money-making\nopportunity. Basically, this is what we do: As with all\nmulti-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new\npartners and selling our products. We do this through regular\nmail or through the information superhighway - the Internet. You\nare not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your\nown home, store or office! Each $5.00 order you will receive will\nhave a self-addressed stamped envelope in it! To fill each order,\nyou simply put the product (a detailed report) in the envelope\nand mail it back. \"That's it... the $5.00 is yours.\" This is the\nGREATEST multi-level mail order marketing plan anywhere!\n\n(1) ORDER ALL 4 REPORTS LISTED AND NUMBERED BELOW IN THIS LETTER.\nDo this by ordering the report from each of the four names\nlisted. For each report send US$5.00 cash and a SELF-ADDRESSED\nSTAMPED ENVELOPE (business size #10) to the person listed and\nREQUEST THAT SPECIFIC REPORT. You will need all 4 reports because\nyou will be reprinting and reselling them. PLEASE do not alter\nthe names or their sequence other than instructed in this letter.\nIMPORTANT: Always provide same day service on all orders you\nreceive!\n\n(2) In this letter, replace the name and address under REPORT #1\nwith your own. Move the one that was there down to REPORT #2.\nMove the name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3. Move the\nname and address listed under REPORT #3 to REPORT #4. The name\nand address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped off the list and\nis no doubt on the way to the bank. When doing this please make\ncertain you copy everyone's name and address accurately. Only move\nthe names and addresses. *Don't move the Report/Product positions*.\n\n(3) Re-distribute this whole information packet (with, of course\nyourself at REPORT #1 position and everyone else bumped down one\nnotch). You can do this in one of two ways:\n\n    (a) Internet : Just like I've done here, it's quick and\n        it's virtually free... send this letter out via e-mail\n        to every e-mail address you know or can get your hands\n        on. There are many companies out there who sell huge\n        e-mail address lists at very low prices. This is a\n        great place to start! In this way you can send this\n        letter out to virtually hundreds of thousands rather\n        than just a few thousand as with snail mail. This will\n        greatly multiply your profits.   You can also post this\n        letter on the internet newsgroups, the more the better\n        for you... millions of people world-wide scan these\n        newsgroups... take advantage of that fact.\n\n    (b) Old Fashioned Snail Mail : First, delete the words\n        \"just as I've done here\" from the paragraph right above\n        this one. Then print out this information packet and\n        take it to your \"quick print\" shop. Have as many copies\n        made as you can initially afford to print. You can\n        always print more later. (The more copies, the bigger\n        the discount). Send a copy of this entire package (it\n        is all important) to everyone whose name and address\n        you can get your hands on.\n\nNOTE: People have reported they get more replies per hundred\npackets sent out if they use snail mail instead of email. It does\ntake a bit more initial investment.\n\n   Start with friends and relatives since you can speak to them\nand encourage them to take advantage of this marvelous money\nmaking plan. Then as your time and finances allow, mail to anyone\nand everyone. You can get names and addresses from classified\nads, phone books and other directories. You can also mail to\nsmall businesses whose addresses are available from their ads in\nthe Yellow Pages and other publications. BEST OF ALL, purchase a\n\"HOT NAME\" mailing list from any of the list of brokers whose\nbusiness it is to provide all sorts of mailing lists. You'll find\nthat a good name list will make you more money than you could\never imagine... it's a great investment!\n\n   (4) Orders will soon start arriving in your mailbox for each\nof the 4 reports. At first, just for REPORT #1, then later for\n#2, #3, and #4... each of these orders will contain a US$5 bill\nand a self-addressed stamped envelope for you to use to mail back\nthe requested report. It's easy!\n\n <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>\n\n     HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $ MONEY $ :\n\nLet's say you decide to start small just to see how it goes and\nwe'll assume you and all those involved only sent out 200 packets\neach (either via e-mail or via regular mail). Let's also assume\nthat each mailing only receives a 5% response (keep in mind that\nmany people will send out thousands of packets instead of only\n200, but for the sake of example here we'll stick with 200). With\na 5% return that's 10 people who participate by sending 200 each\nor 2,000 total. The 5% response to that brings 100 orders. Those\n100 mail out 200 each or 20,000 total. The 5% return on 20,000 is\n1,000. The 1,000 send out 200,000 total and that 5% response will\ngenerate 10,000 five dollar bills for you... CASH! Your\ntotal income in this example situation:\n\n  1st Level - 10 people respond out of 200 with $5         $50\n  2nd Level - 10 people respond to those 10 ($5 x 100)    $500\n  3rd Level - 10 respond to the 100 ($5 x 1000)          $5000\n  4th Level - 10 respond to those 1000 (10000 $5 bills) $50000\n                                                      ======\n                           Rounded down, this totals to $55000\n\n   Remember friends, this is assuming that 95 out of every 100\npeople you mail to, do absolutely nothing with this opportunity\nand trash it. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if\neveryone sent out 1,000 packets instead of 200 (very easy to\naccomplish that via e-mail). Believe me, many people will do just\nthat... and more. It is to their benefit to do so!

Send for the 4 reports IMMEDIATELY\nso you will have them when the orders start coming in because:\nWhen you receive a $5 order, you *must* send out the requested\nreport to comply with the US Postal & Lottery Laws, Title 18,\nSections 1302 and 1341 or Title 39 Section 3005 in the US Code,\nalso Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 & 436 - which\nstate that \"a product or service must be exchanged for\nmoney received\".\n\nWHILE YOU WAIT FOR YOUR REPORTS TO ARRIVE:\n\n(1) Name your new company (or use your own name if you wish).\n\n(2) Re-arrange the names and addresses, including yours, and\naffix them under the correct report according to the directions,\nbumping off the 4th name. (If you will be advertising by snail\nmail, you might want to re-type that whole page where the names\nand addresses appear, and of course include yours at REPORT #1.)\n\n(3) Obtain as many e-mail addresses or regular snail mail\naddresses as you can. If sending via snail mail, REPORT #3\n(... when you receive it in the mail) will tell you where you\ncan get great snail mailing lists.\n\n(4) If sending by snail mail, make enough copies of this letter\nto fill your mailing quantity.\n\n(5) Copy the 4 reports when you do get them so you are able to\nsend them out right away when you receive an order.\n\n <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>\n\n              YOUR GUARANTEE OF SUCCESS\n\n   The check point that GUARANTEES your success is simply this:\nYou MUST receive 15 to 20 orders for REPORT #1! THIS IS A MUST!\nIf you don't within 2 weeks, send out more packets until you do.\nThen, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100\norders for REPORT #2. If you don't, send out more packets until\nyou do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2,\nYOU CAN RELAX, because YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO $50,000! Also,\nremember, every time your name is moved down on the list you are\nin front of a different report, so you can keep track of your\nprogress by what report people are ordering from you.\n\n   \"IT'S THAT EASY\".\n\n <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>  <>\n\nNow, here is the list of the 4 reports and how to order them:\n\n(NOTE: Always send a Self-Addressed, Stamped Envelope with US$5\ncash - concealed in a piece of paper, of course - in your order\nfor each report.

I began as an\nindependent small businessman in 1969. Using good business\npractices I had a profitable business for 10 years. In 1979 my\nbusiness began falling off. I was doing the same things that were\npreviously successful for me but now they just weren't working.\n\n  Finally it hit me. It wasn't me. It's just that our economy had\ngone crazy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable\neconomic growth that had been with us since 1945. I don't have to\ntell you what happened to the employment rate because many of you\nknow from first hand experience. There were more small business\nfailures and bankruptcies than ever before... Traditional methods\nof making money will never allow you to move up or \"get rich\".\nInflation will see to that.\n\n  You have just received the information that can give you\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life. With practically no\nrisk and just a little bit of effort, you can have more money in\nthe next few months than you have ever imagined.\n\n  I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your\nmoney or anyone else's who participates in my plan. *This one's\nfor you*.\n\n  I've made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS and retired from the plan\nafter having sent out over 16,000 letter packets. I have moved to\nthe rich side of the tracks. Will you be able to say the same in\nsix weeks ?  If you send out only one-tenth as many packets as I\ndid, you can be a rich person.\n\n  Please follow the plan exactly as instructed. Do not change it\nin any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to\nsend a copy of all this introductory literature to everyone that\nyou can think of. Don't feel hesitant about sending out only a\nfew dozen packets in the beginning. One of the people that you\nsend this packet to may send out 5,000 and your name will be on\nevery single one of them. Remember though: the more you send out,\nthe more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I've\ngiven you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to\nbecome financially independent. IT'S NOW UP TO YOU.\n\n  I am enjoying an early secure retirement on the fortune that I\nmade by sending out packets just like this one. You too will be\nmaking easy money in three or four weeks... if you follow the\nsimple steps outlined in this mailing. To be financially\nindependent is to be free; free to make money decisions as you\nnever have before, go into business, get into investments,\nretire, or take a vacation. No longer will the lack of money hold\nyou back...\n\n  Will you ignore this amazing opportunity... or will you take\nadvantage of it and change the direction of your life ? If you\ndon't think this is a truly spectacular opportunity, then please\ntake the time to re-read this material. You have indeed missed\nsomething. If you have any questions, please feel free to write\nthe sender of this information. You'll get a prompt and\ninformative reply.\n\n  My method is simple. I sell thousands of people a product for\n$5.00 that costs me pennies to produce and mail. Everyone\ninvolved in the program makes money for everyone else in the\nprogram. IF ANYONE MAKES MONEY, EVERYONE MAKES MONEY. I should\nalso point out that this program is completely legal. At times,\nyou've probably received chain letters asking you to send money\nbut getting nothing in return - no product whatsoever. Not only\nare chain letters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the\nchain makes them quite unattractive.\n\n  This plan has the effect and appeal of a chain letter, but is\nlegal since you are offering a legitimate, valuable product to\nyour people. After they purchase the product from you, they\nproduce more and resell the product. It's simple free enterprise\nat work, THE AMERICAN WAY.\n\n  As you have learned from the enclosed material, the \"PRODUCT\"\nin this plan is a series of four financial and business reports.\nThe information contained in these reports will not only help you\nin making your participation in this plan more rewarding, but\nwill be useful to you in other business decisions you make in the\nyears ahead. You are also buying the rights to reprint all of the\nreports which will be ordered from you by those to whom you\nchoose to mail this packet.\n\n  The concise one and two page reports you'll be buying can\neasily be reproduced at a local copy center at a cost of\napproximately 4 cents per page in small quantities of 200. The\nprice goes down considerably for larger quantities of 1,000 or\nmore. Of course you may want to print just a small quantity until\nthe money comes rolling in. You can always call your\nprinter with another order.\n\n. Good luck with this plan and GOD BLESS YOU,\n\n                                    Edward L.

I  threw  it away, but\nlater wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I\nhad no idea who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until\nI was emailed another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed,\nthen it came.  I DIDN'T throw this one away.

You get out of life what you put into it.'\nThrough trial  and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I\nfinally figured it  out. The program works very well, I just had\nto find the right target  group of people to email it to.  So far\nthis year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.  I know\nmy dad would have been very proud of me.\"\n\n                                        Alan B., Philadelphia, PA\n\n\"IT WAS TRULY AMAZING\"\n\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up\nmy mind to participate in this program.

BOY, was I ever surprised when I found my\nmedium sized post office box crammed with orders! I will make\nmore money this year than any ten years of my life before.\"\n\n                                        Mary R., Lansing, MI\n\n\"AWESOME\"\n\nDo you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like\npiled up on a kitchen table?

After the kids had grown up and left, he was looking\nforward to retirement. Then his plant closed. He borrowed against\nthe house to keep going while he looked for work but nobody\nwould hire someone his age. About then I saw this plan on the\nInternet, printed it and mailed it to him. In desperation, he\nsent out 150  letters. The response was good so he mailed out a\nthousand more. Now he has paid off the house and the car, and he\nand Mom are planning how to enjoy his retirement after a few more\nmailings. This plan has given my Dad a new future.\n\n                                   James N., Sacramento, CA\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

I\ntherefore have to implement some alternative to a straight bounce. I have some\nideas in this area that I am currently coding up, which once I get them\nimplemented will make it possible for me to use more filtering options than I\ncan now.\n\n> I suggested precisely that about a week or two ago.\n\n> Can nobody here write a procmail recipe? (I thought it was just me who's\n> procmail-challenged...)\n\nI'm quite capable of writing a procmail script. However, you are assuming this\nlist is hosted on a system capable of running procmail or a procmail script\nthat I would write. This assumption is false. There's a system comparable to\nprocmail I could use on  this particular system, but that's not the issue. The\nkey issue is what action the script can take.\n\nThe long and short of it is that you going to have to be a little patient here.\nI have lots of other work to do besides running this particular list (which is\nbut one of the several dozen I look after). I am working on a solution to the\nproblem as fast as I can, and I hope to have something in place soon. (Of\ncourse every message like this I write merely takes time away from my\ncoding...)\n\n                                Ned\n\nP.S. Please note that I have not been specific about the measures I intend to\ntake. This is intentional. Broadcasting the details of the filtering you use\nmerely makes it easier for someone to work around the measures you have taken.\nIf anyone wants specifics after I have something in place just send me private\nemail and I will be happy to fill you in.\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

The current working groups are as listed below, although\nexpansion beyond this to include other scripts will also be under\nconsideration at the May 1997 meeting.\n\nWG:   Current scope:\n~~    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWG1:  Transliteration of Cyrillic\nWG2:  Transliteration of Arabic\nWG3:  Transliteration of Hebrew\nWG4:  Transliteration of Korean\nWG5:  Transliteration of Greek\nWG6:  Transliteration of Chinese\nWG7:  Transliteration of Japanese\nWG8:  Joint SC/SC4 Working Group: Relations between transliteration\n        and machine representation of characters\nWG9:  Transliteration of Thai\nWG10: Transliteration of Mongolian\nWG11: Transliteration of Persian\n\n\nDespite all the work on ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode, there will always be a\nneed for transliteration as long as people do not have the same level of\ncompetence in all scripts besides the script used in their mother-tongue,\nand may have a need to deal with these languages, or when they have to\ndeal with mechanical or computerised equipment which does not provide all\nthe scripts of characters that they need.\n\nPeople are now begining to realise that transliteration may have more\nindirect impact on other aspects of multilingual computing than they had\npreviously realised.\n\n\nA mailing list and Web Site for ISO/TC46/SC2\n\nThe secretary (Evangelos Melagrakis from Greece) and I now intend to make\ntransliteration and ISO/TC46/SC2 far more visible and far more relevant to\nend users than it has been in the past.\n\nTo enable this, ELOT (the Greek national standards body) has set up an\nelectronic mailing list for ISO/TC46/SC2 (tc46sc2@elot.gr) and a related\nWeb site <http://www.elot.gr/tc46sc2/list/>.\n\nWe hope this list will attract researchers and scientists who can add\nuseful information which might assist in developing standards on the\nConversion of Written Languages.\n\nWe also hope to have an emphasis on issues of using computers to do\nappropriate transformations necessary in automated transliteration, and also\nlook forward to having regular contact with those on this list who are\ninterested in such issues.\n\nThere are quite a few with an interest in transliteration in library\ncatalogues on the list, but there are other potential users of\ntransliteration too.\n\nThere are now over 240 subscribers to tc46sc2@elot.gr, from 41 countries\nand territories which indicate the worldwide interest.\n\nOne major advantage of email is the ability to involve far more people in\nthe development of a common purpose than were involved before, to get user\nfeedback, and expert opinion from various sources.\n\n\nSubscribing to the mailing list for ISO/TC46/SC2\n\nIn order to join the list, send an email to\n\n        majordomo@elot.gr\n\nwith this message in the body of the text:\n\n        subscribe tc46sc2 your@email.address\n\n(but with your real email address replacing the string your@email.address).\n\n\nTo find out further commands you can use, send the command \"help\" as the text\nof an email either to tc46sc2-request@elot.gr or to: majordomo@elot.gr\nTo unsubscribe, send the command \"unsubscribe\" instead, omitting the \"quotes\"\nmarks in both cases. This will tell you how to obtain copies of past\nmessages etc., and other useful features.\n\nOnce you are subscribed, you can send messages to tc46sc2@elot.gr and receive\nmessages from other members of the list. Please reply where possible to the\nlist as a whole, so that all can benefit: using the Group Reply function\n(pressing G on some email software) is the simplest way to achieve this.\n\nOther members will also be interested to see who else is joining the list, so\nit is useful to send a brief introduction (say, one or two short paragraphs)\nto tc46sc2@elot.gr at the outset, saying what languages, scripts and other\nthings you are involved in. That is the most likely way to stimulate others\nto write on the subjects you are interested in!\n\nYou should also inform your national standards body to express your interest\nin participating in this list. I can provide some information on details of\nyour national member body of ISO, if you send me an email requesting this.\n\nI look forward to seeing new participants on this list. Please feel free to\nforward this to anyone else who may be interested in transliteration\nstandardisation issues, and to send any queries about the list to me.\n\n                                   Yours sincerely\n\n\n                                     John Clews\n--\n   John Clews (Chairman of ISO/TC46/SC2: Conversion of Written Languages)\n\nSESAME Computer Projects, 8 Avenue Rd.  *  email: Converse@sesame.demon.co.uk\nHarrogate, HG2 7PG, United Kingdom      *     telephone: +44 (0) 1423 888 432\n\n\n--Boundary_(ID_6XmGYsFtcEHO6gl9j/V1gQ)--\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Let's Begin......\n\n Have you ever wanted to market on-line? If so, this is for you. Let me tell yo\nu a\nlittle about ourselves. We established our business in 1995. After marketing ov\ner\n20 products very successfully on-line, we are releasing the Biggest Secret to\nOn-Line Marketing. Every minute of the day 7 new people log on-line. That's\n10,080 people per day! Is that unbelievable or what? Do you know what that\nmeans? That's 10,080 new business prospects per day! There are over 65\nMILLION prospects waiting for you right now! By the end of the year there is\nexpected to be over 95 MILLION people on-line! As you can simply tell, there\nis no end to this. Let's face it. There are many large companies investing\nMILLIONS of dollars per day on the Internet, and for one reason only. They\nknow this is where their business is going to be by the year 2000. Marketing\nOn-Line can be a very difficult task, but it doesn't have to be. That's where\nwe come in. We have put together an unbelievable marketing package\ntogether for you that nobody can even come close to.\n\n   Don't be fooled by these people telling you that you need Floodgate and\nother similar programs to send bulk mail- it's a lie. Floodgate only extracts t\nhe\naddresses. That can be VERY time consuming and costly. They make it\nsound so easy, and when in reality, it's not. We'll put it this way- to even ge\nt\n1 Million E-mail addresses with Floodgate, it would take you at least 6 months.\n\n\n   You may ask yourself, \"How can they get so many addresses?\" We have\nbeen marketing on the Internet for over one year now. All of these E-mail\naddresses have been collected within the past month! Are E-Mail Addresses\nare updated on a monthly basis. The difference from our Database and other\npeoples, is that people on the 'NET' are constantly trading Databases and\nthey get MANY Duplicates! WE DON'T TRADE OUR E-MAIL DATABASES,\nTHEY ARE ALL GENERATED IN HOUSE. We have the experience and\nknowledge to know where and how to obtain the addresses quickly. We\nalso receive them from some of the largest ISP's in the country.\n\n   There are other SO-CALLED companies that will claim to give you 10 to\n20 MILLION ADDRESSES- and they lie! They will only give you 5 to 9\nHUNDERED THOUSAND! When you receive them, they're all scrambled\nup and half of the addresses aren't even valid. They have dates, they are\nput in many different formats, and extra characters are added on the end of\nthem, so they won't even be sent. You will get 3/4 of the mail back as\nUNDELIVERABLE, which means the computer can't even send them!\nDon't be taken by these people.\n\n   Also, we have made it as easy as possible for you. We have put them\nALL in a Pegasus Mailing List for you! You will also receive a copy of\nPegasus Mail, if you don't have it. Then, all you have to do is click 3\nBUTTONS and they will be sent. This is as easy as it gets! They have\nbeen tested and they are DELIVERABLE, which means they will all go\nthrough. We are selling the WHOLE 2 MILLION E-Mail database for\nonly $69.95! If you're asking yourself, \"Why are they only selling them\nfor $69.95 when he has a good list, and these OTHER COMPANIES\nare selling them for $149.00 to $500.00, and their lists are poorly put\ntogether?\" The answer is simply, \"We believe in producing high quality\nproducts, that should be priced reasonably.\" We understand that not\nall people have Hundreds or even Thousands of Dollars to invest. We\nhave made this as easy as possible for anyone to get started.\n\n   With this E-Mail List, we will also include a \"Step by Step Guide\" that\nwill show you everything you need to know to send your E-Mail out. It's\nvery easy and anybody can do it. So if you have a computer, use it to\nMake Money Now don't let it cost you money. Just imagine E-mailing\n2 MILLION people. That's like sending 2 MILLION letters at .32 cents\nPER STAMP! Can you imagine if you only had a 1% response rate?\nThat's still 20,000 ORDERS! All you have to do is take your idea and GO!\nMany people have no idea about the power of the Internet. People are\nalways wondering why other people are wealthy and there not. The\nreason is simply \"THEY TAKE ACTION\" And You Can To Right Now!\n\n   You can make this work to your advantage and we'll show you how.\nWe can GUARANTEE you that you will never see another offer like\nthis, so act now.

            "content": "Hi, if you have ever considered getting a loan or grant...you should read this.\n\nWe Have Over 150 Private Foundations In Our Program All Over the\nUnited States.\n\nWE ARE A FINANCIAL FINDER & MATCHING SERVICE\n.\"INTEREST - FREE CASH GRANTS - NEVER PAY BACK!\"...\n\n\nFOUNDATIONS CAN BE A BETTER SOURCE FOR FINANCE, THAN BANKS\n\nFoundations give away billions of dollars every year to individuals.\nMost are non-profit organizations dedicated to the betterment of\nsociety.  A foundation is exempt  from income tax because of its\nnon-profit status.  Private foundations have been giving out\ncash-grants to people for over 100 years.  You can check with your\nattorney or local chamber of commerce.\n\nARE YOU BEING REJECTED FOR THE MONEY YOU NEED SO BADLY?\n\nThen Why Not Try A Private Foundation? Interest Free Cash Grants From\n$500.00 & Up to $25,000.00. No Collateral.  No Cosigners, No Security\nDeposit, No Mortgages. No Credit Check.  No Pay Back.\n\nThe Money May Be Used For Any Worthwhile Purpose;  Education,\nPersonal  Welfare,  Business, Medical, Religion, Etc.\n\nANYONE CAN GET AN INTEREST FREE CASH GRANT!\n\nAs long as they have a genuine reason for needing money and as long as\nthe foundation guidelines are met.\n\nDear Applicant,\n\nThis letter tells you HOW YOU CAN GET AN INTEREST-FREE CASH GRANT.\nTake a few minutes to read it. You'll be suprised  to see how easy it can\nbe to get a grant.  From time to time, everyone needs to\nborrow.  The problem is that for most people, getting a loan is a big\nhassle. Going to banks or finance companies in person takes a lot of\ntime.  In most cases, there is endless paperwork.  And Unfortunately,\nin many cases all that you end up with is a rejection notice.\n\n\nABSOLUTELY NO CREDIT CHECK\n\nGetting a Grant by mail is probably a lot easier than you think.  In\nyour area, there are usually only a small number of places that will\nprovide you with the money, that you need.  On the other hand, there\nare literally thousands of private foundations who donate money to\npeople who have genuine reasons for needing the money.\n\nChances are that most banks in your area have very stringent loan\nrequirements.  On the other hand, most foundations who give GRANTS BY\nMAIL are more lenient; in a sense that  persons who have poor credit, no credit\n,\nor even those who have gone through bankruptcy  are able to get the money\nthat they need - sent to them by a check payable to them. This\nis because foundations are NOT interested in CREDIT RATINGS.\n\nGETTING A GRANT BY MAIL IS CONFIDENTIAL\n\nThere are no embarrassing interviews.  Neither collateral nor\ncosigners are required.  The main requirement is that you have a\nlegitimate need for the money and are willing to use it for whatever\nreason that the foundation agrees to.\n\nWe are not associated with any of the foundations in our program,\ntherefore all money will go directly to you, payable to you.  As a\nFinancial Finder & Matching Service, we know where the money is and\nwhich private foundations may be most likely to approve your grant.\nThere are thousands of foundations with money to donate.  It is our job\nto put you in touch with them.\n\nPLEASE REMEMBER: CASH-GRANTS are FREE of any interest,\n& they DO NOT NEED TO BE PAID BACK!\n\nFoundations give out money for a wide variety of needs as long as it\nis something LEGAL. This means that you obtain the money to cover\nbills, meet emergency needs, or to buy anything that you might\nneed, as long as the foundation agrees to it.\n\n\nYOU DECIDE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU WANT TO OBTAIN.\n\nThe amount can be as little as $500.00, and up to $25,000.00 is\npossible.  And remember, there is NO CREDIT CHECK.\n\nAs a Financial Finder & Matching Service, we'll review your service\napplication form and determine which foundations may be most likely to\nprovide you with the money that you need.  Keep in mind that we have\nonly reputable foundations in our program.  You are protected by the\nfact that these foundations are regulated by the laws of the United\nStates.\n\nNo matter how much you need to obtain, no matter what you need to use\nthe money for; we feel confident that we can help you to get it with\nthe service we are offering.\n\nWE GUARANTEE THAT UNLESS WE HELP YOU WITH OUR SERVICE,\nOUR APPLICATION FEE OF $19.95 WILL BE REFUNDED!\n\nOur Application fee is $19.95 .

How does it work?  Pyruvate is a three-\ncarbon molecule present in every human cell and in nearly every food.  It is\na key to energy burning because it allows the release of ATP.  This patented\nformula enters the Kreb cycle to increase the level of pyruvate, creating a\nhigher energy requirement.  The body burns more fat, not protein.  As a\nbeneficial side effect, the body has increased endurance.   Pyruvate+ was a\nsecret weapon for Gold medalist Shannon Miller in the 1996 Olympic Games.\nSuper Model Carol Alt uses Pyruvate+ to keep in top form and maintain\nendurance.\n\nTo order call  1-602-503-0266  - or - for FREE INFORMATION  :   send an E-Mail\nto:    econo@answerme.com    and type -    SLIM   -  in the  subject  line.\n\n*This is an auto-response system, and you must type  SLIM  in the subject\nline to make it work.

I see messages posted to lists not less\nthan a couple of times every day that include the phrase \"I'm not on this\nlist so please cc me in any responses\".\n\nSecond, this list, like many other lists, has any number of sublists on other\nmachines, not to mention news gateways. As such, even if it didn't make\nsense for non-subscribers to post, I have no way of determining whether or\nnot someone is on the list, at least not wich sufficient accuracy on which\nto base a decision to bounce mail.\n\nThird, there is nothing that says the address I use when I post is the one I\nuse to receive list mail. In my case it certainly isn't, and I'll bet this\napplies to lots of other people as well. Now, some list managers, including the\none I use here, provide a feature by which they can have addresses on the list\nfor purposes of authentication that do not get copies of list  mail (this is\nusually referred to an address being SET NOMAIL). And this is probably\nsufficient in the case of non-IETF lists. But as I have previously explained,\nit simply isn't acceptable in the case of IETF lists because of the importance\nof the issues discussed on such lists and the current litigious climate.\n\nFinally, I have now managed to get some anti-spam facilities installed on this\nlist. (This message is an initial test to see if they work.) Again, I have\nno intention of describing these facilities publicly; if you want a complete\ndescription send me private mail and I will explain what I have done.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

            "content": "--Boundary_(ID_7zEM4O0Mp5g0HQMv7DYssg)\nContent-type: TEXT/PLAIN\n\nDear Friend\n\nThe following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look\nat. It can be started with very minimal outlay and the income return is\ntremendous.\n\nIt is easy to do and does not require much time. With this program\nit is easy to make at least $50,000.00 in less than 90 days. Do not let this\nslip through your fingers, I almost did and if I had I would not have made the\nmoney I used to buy my new house. In mid February '96, I received this\nprogram, I did not send for it, it just showed up on my e-mail. After reading\nit several times and taking it to an accountant, I could see that this was a\ntrue money making phenomenon. I could invest as little or as much as I wanted\nand I would at least get my money back.\n\nAfter determining that it was not a chain letter and that it is perfectly\nlegal, I decided \"why not?\"\nInitially I sent out 10,000 emails which cost very little because all I had\nto pay for was my on-line time.\nThis batch will be my eighth one.\n\nThere are many good programs which will be discussed in Report #3. All of\nthem are easy to use and very easy to get.\nIn less than one week I was starting to recieve orders for report #1. By\nMarch I had received 32 orders for report #1. When you read the guarentee in\nthe program, you will see that you need to receive 15-20 orders for report #1\nwithin two weeks. If you don't, send out more programs until you do! The first\nstep is done. By the end of March I had received 267 orders for report #2.\nYou must receive receive at least 100 orders for report #2. By April, I had\nreceived over $73,000.00. THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS\nEXACTLY AS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM. DO NOT TRY TO PLACE YOUR NAME IN A\nDIFFERENT PLACE. IT WILL NOT WORK AND EVERYBODY WILL LOSE OUT. Report #2 ex-\nplains why this is so.\n\nThink about it, this program works and when your \"system\" for making it work\nis discovered you can do this a few times a year and then ???\n\nAll I wanted was a new home and I got it.\n\n                        Sincerely\n                        Greg Godby\n\n\nA PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM\n\nBy the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the\nenclosed program, and reports you should have have concluded that such a\nprogram, and one that is legal, could not hve been created by an amateur.\n\nYou have just received information that can give financial information for the\nrest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort. you can make\nmoney in the next few months that you had never imagined.\n\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It\nworks exceedingly well as it is now. Rememebr to email a copy of this program\nto everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out\n50,000...and your name will be on everyone of them. Rememeber the more you\nsend out the more potential customers you can reach. the program works and\nthere are millions of people who would testify to that. Any doubts you have\nwill vanish when the first orders start to come in.\n\nHERE IS HOW THIS PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$$\n\nLet's say you decide to start small, just see how it goes and assume that you\nand all those involved send out 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that\nyou get a 5% response. Using a good list the response could be much better.\nAlso many people will send out hundereds of thousands instead of 2,000. but\ncontinuing with this example, you send out only 2,000. With a 5% response that\nis only 10 orders from report #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000\nprograms for a total of 20,000. Out of those 5%, 100 peple respond and order\nreport #2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The\n5% response to that is 1,000 orders for report #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000\nreports each for a 2,000,000 total. the 5% response to that is 10,000 orders\nfor report #4. That's 10,000 five dollar bills to you. CASH!!! Your total\nincome in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000 + $50,000 for a total of\n$55,000!!!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\nSTEP (1) Order all four reports listed by name and number. Do this by ordering\nthe report from each of the (4) names listed on the next page. For each report\nsend $5 CASH AND SELF-ADDRESSED STAMPED ENVELOPE (BUSINESS SIZE #10).\nInternational orders should include $1 extra for postage. It is essential that\nyou specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are\nordering from. You will need all four (4) reorts because you will be\nreprinting and reselling them. Do not alter the names or sequence other than wh\nat\nthe instructions say. IMPORTANT: Always provides sameday service on all orders!\n\nSTEP (2) Replace the name and address under report #1 with yours, moving the\none that was down there to REPORT #2 and so on. The name and address that was\nunder REPORT #4 will be dropped from the list. Whne doing this make sure the\naddresses and names are correct. DO NOT MIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT\nPOSITIONS!!!\n\nSTEP (3) Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it as a TEXT\n(.txt) file in its own directory. Again REPORT #3 will tell you the best\nmethods for bulk mailing and aquiring email lists.\n\nSTEP (4) Email a copy of the entire program (all of this is very important) to\neveryone you can get your hands on. Start with friends and relatives since you\ncan encourage of this fabulous money making opportunity. That's what I did.\nAnd they love me now more than ever. Then email to anyone and everyone!Use\nyour imagination! You can get email lists from companies on the internet who\nspecialize in email lists. These are very cheap, 100,000 addresses for\n$35.00.\n\n\nYOU MUST ALWAYS ASK FOR FRESH LISTS AND ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON ALL\nORDERS\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY NUMBER AND NAME!!!!!\n\nALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED STAMPED ENVELOPE AND $5 CASH FOR EACH ORDER\nREQUESTING THE SPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nREPORT #1\nHOW TO MAKE $250,000.00 THROUGH MULTI LEVEL SALES\nGDG Enterprises\nP.O.

I sell thousands of people a product that costs me\npennies to produce and email. I should also point out that this program is\nentrely legal and that everyone who participates will make money. This is not\na chain letter or a pyramid sscam. At times you have received chain letters\nasking you to send money, on faith, but getting nothing in return. This is\nunattractive for many reasons.\n\nBest Wishes and good luck!!!!\n\nTips for success\n1. Name your new company. You can use your own name.\n2. Get a post office box (preferred).\n3. Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must remember, your own\nname and address go next to report #1 and all the others move down one, with\nthe fourth being bumped off the list.\n4. Obtain as many email addresses as possible from the names given in report\n#3.\n5. Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.\n6. After mailing the programs get ready to fill the orders.\n7. Copy the four reports so you can send them out right away.\n8. Make sure the reports are neat and legible.\n\n\nGUARANTEE\nthe check point which guarentees your success is simply this: You must receive\n15 to 20 orders for report #1. This is a must!!! If you don't within two weeks\nyou need to send more emails. Then a couple of weeks later, you should receive\nat least 100 or more orders for report #2. Once you have received 100 or more\norders, you can sit back and relax because you are going to make at least\n$50,000 dollars!!! mathematically this is s aporven guarentee. of those who\nhave participated in the programand reached the above guarentees-All have\nreached their $50,000 goal. Also remember, every time your name is moved down\non the list you are in front of a different report, so you can keep track of\nyour program by knowing what people are ordering from you. It's really this\neasy!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--Boundary_(ID_7zEM4O0Mp5g0HQMv7DYssg)--\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

We are a business partner with a marketing company which\ndevelops buyers for its clients' products through electronic marketing; primari\nly broadcast fax.  Together, we have over a hundred clients, almost 10% of whic\nh are Fortune 500 companies.   We have numerous staff,\nand have just begun, at client request, to work with E Mail.\n\nAs professional marketers, we found that one of the great difficulties in worki\nng with E Mail as it exists today, is that there are very few targeted E Mail l\nists.  Most of the lists which do exist consist simply of numerous E Mail addre\nsses; there is no way to tell if the addresses are for businesses, doctors, ind\nividuals, men, women, or what have you.  If you have a product to sell, in orde\nr to reach a target market you have to send out a large quantity of E Mail and\nhope some of them get to the people you really want to reach.\n\nNo longer.\n\nWe can now offer you the capability to create custom E Mail lists for you by ob\ntaining the E Mail addresses from WEB sites which fit the profile of the people\n you wish to sell to.\n\nTo do this we use a combination the latest software technology, coupled with ou\nr state of the art hardware and T1 pipelines.  Our software is a one two punch\nof edge of the envelope programming.  When we create a custom E Mail list for y\nou, our first step is to program your key search words into an intelligent agen\nt, which we turn loose on the Internet to find all the WEB sites which fit the\nprofile of the companies and individuals you wish to sell your product to.  Tha\nt's the first punch.  Then we unleash the second punch; a program to strip the\nE Mail addresses from the WEB site our agent has found for you.\n\nThe result is an E Mail list custom developed for you and you alone; a compilat\nion of E Mail addresses from WEB sites selected as matching the criteria you ha\nve given us as your customer profile.\n\nE Mail is a powerful tool even without a targeted list.  Think of how much more\n powerful it will be for you if you are E Mailing your sales message to recipie\nnts who exactly match your customer profile.\n\nAnd not only can we develop a custom E Mail list for you, but once it's complet\ned, we will E Mail your sales message to that list.\n\nIf we may be of service to you, please call us at (818) 701-2001.\n\nFollowing is a price list for the development of a custom E Mail list for you f\nrom a search of WEB sites which fit your customer profile.\n\nOne Time Programming Fee To Set Up A Custom Intelligent Agent For Your Internet\n Search:  $600.00\n\nPrice List For Custom E Mail List Development Following Programming:\n\nNumber of               Cost\nEmail Addresses\n                \n25,000                  $150.00\n\n50,000                  $250.00\n\n75,000                  $335.00\n\n100,000                 $450.00\n\n500,000                 $1,850.00\n\n1,000,000               $2,500.00\n\nLarger orders bid upon request.\n\n\nIf you wish us to send out your E Mail list with your sales message once you li\nst is completed, the following prices apply:\n\n\nPrice List To Send Your Custom E Mail list:\n\nAmount                  Cost\n\n25,000                  $100.00\n\n50,000                  $175.00.00\n\n75,000                  $225.00\n\n100,000                 $300.00\n\n500,000                 $650.00\n\n1,000,000               $785.00\n\nWe look forward to working with you.

And I apologize.\n\nThis IS NOT a chain letter or a  \"send me one dollar\" mailing\n\nBUT if you are interested in learning about a NEW 100% guaranteed\nMoney making package that is NOT like the junk you usually get,\nThen read on..\n\nI will cut to the chase here and not waste any time by putting up\ntestimonials (which could be faked).  I will just briefly tell you\nmy situation.  About a year ago I quit my job of 8 years, I just had\nENOUGH of working for someone else.  I did not have a plan, I didn't\nhave any money put away to fall back on. Why would I do that?  Sounds\nNUTS doesn't it?  I did it because I wanted to work for myself, and\nI knew enough about the internet and it's potential to start doing\nsomething for myself and my family. It was a little scary at first\nbut that lasted only ONE WEEK.\n\nYou see, I have always had these ideas in the back of my head\nand I would constantly say \"someday\", we'll that someday was\nNOW, because if I didn't get off my butt and DO something about\nit, I wasn't going to be able to pay my rent, and I would be on\nthe street!\n\nThat is when I started to put my ideas into action,  My FIRST\nweek I made 7 thousand dollars on the internet, easy as that!!\nI won't lie to you, I had a great idea, I did not screw anybody,\neverything was on the up and up and I had more customers than I\ncould handle (isn't that nice?) I had to \"hire\" my wife to help me\nthe very next week because I had DOUBLED the previous weeks orders\nand INCOME.  NOTE: I am just a regular guy just like anyone else!\nBut now I was slowly becoming RICH. I paid off all my debts, Bought new\nfurniture and deposited 11 grand more all in the same month.\n\nHOW?\n\nI will SHOW you how,  not just TELL  you how\nI will give you the tools and techniques to get it all done!\nThis program is not like the junk you see on late night TV\nYou get REAL tools, manuals, a CDROM and more\n\nThis package is GUARANTEED,  YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK\nif it does not work for you!!\n\nLet me tell you exactly what you get\n\n1.

Do you think it is likely\nthat 1 person out of a thousand will buy your report?\nI THINK SO.  I have done this OVER AND OVER.\nThe email addresses are updated every 2 weeks so they\nare never the same twice.\n\n4.

A few comments below.\n\n\n>     1.  Introduction\n\n>     The Internet is international.\n\n>     With the international Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n>     interchange data in a multiplicity of languages, which in turn\n>     utilize a bewildering number of characters or other character-like\n>     representation mechanisms.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"other character-like representation mechanisms\"?\n\n\n>     This document is (INTENDED TO BE) the current policies being\n>     applied by the Internet Engineering Steering Group towards the\n>     standardization efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force in\n>     order to help Internet protocols fulfil these requirements.\n\n\n>     2.  Where to do internationalization\n\n>     Internationalization is for humans. This means that protocols are\n>     not subject to internationalization; text strings are. Where\n>     protocols may masquerade as text strings, such as in many IETF\n>     application layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts\n>     are protocol and which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n\n>     Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many\n>     of them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak\n>     out of the local context at times. RFC 1958 [ARCH] recommends US-\n>     ASCII for all globally visible names.\n\n>     This document does not mandate a policy on name\n>     internationalization, but requires that all protocols describe\n>     whether names are internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\nI think that by names, you mean things such as filenames, mail addresses,\nand so on. It would be good to make this clear.\n\n\n>     3.  Character sets\n\n>     For a definition of the term \"character set\", refer to the\n>     workshop report. Like MIME, this document uses it to mean the\n>     combination of a coded character set and a character encoding\n>     scheme.\n\nI think the title should be something like \"character encoding\".\nThe MIME terminology is unfortunate. It was created with only\na limited view on character encoding, and is confusing and\ninappropriate. In particular, it is strange to say that a\n\"character set\" is the combination of a coded character set\nand a character encoding scheme. The term \"coded character set\"\nexpresses, with the word \"coded\", the fact that something is\nadded to a character set, namely an identifying unique number\n(or bit combination) to each character in the character set.\nThe word \"set\" is by most people associated more or less closely\nwith its mathematical meaning, and it is used that way in the\nterm \"coded character set\", but it is totally misleading in the\nterm \"character set\" as used in MIME.\n\nIt is very clear that the parameter name \"charset\" should not\nbe changed at all. But there is absolutely no justification for\nkeeping a misleading term such as \"character set\"; there is no\nrequirement for terminology to be backwards compatible with\na particular IETF prototol, and there are other IETF documents\n(e.g. HTML i18n, MHML) that use much more understandable and\nless misleading terminology. Just using \"Charset\" instead of\n\"character set\" would already be a great improvement.\n\n\n>     3.1.  What character set to use\n\n>     All protocols MUST identify, for all character data, which\n>     character set is in use.\n\n>     Protocols MUST be able to use the ISO 10646 coded character set,\n>     with the UTF-8 character encoding scheme, for all text. (This is\n>     called \"UTF-8\" in the rest of this document)\n\n>     They MAY specify how to use other character sets or other\n>     character encoding schemes, such as UTF-16, but lack of an ability\n>     to use UTF-8 needs clear and solid justification in the protocol\n>     specification document before being entered into or advanced upon\n>     the standards track.\n\nSaying that protocols MUST use 10646 with UTF-8, and then saying that\nthey can do otherwise with solid justification is a contradiction.\nProbably, what we want is to say:\n\nProtocols MUST be able to use 10646.\nProtocols SHOULD use UTF-8 to transport 10646.\n\n>     For existing protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n>     datastores, support of other character sets, or even using a\n>     default other than UTF-8, may be a requirement. This is\n>     acceptable, but UTF-8 support MUST be possible.\n\nThere may be good reasons in the future in some protocols to go\ne.g. to UTF-16 or whatever. I think it is a very good idea to\nstreamline ietf on UTF-8, it has enormous advantages. But on\nthe other side, writing this in stone is not really necessary\nnor desirable.\n\nOne main opposition to UTF-8 may come from scripts and users\nwhere UTF-8 is not very compact (CJK at first, but then in\nparticular India and South East Asia).\n\n\n\n>     3.2.  How to decide a character set\n\n>     In some cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n>     communication between the producer and the consumer of a character\n>     set. In this case, it may make sense to negotiate a character set\n>     before sending data.\n\n\"In this case\" seems to refer to HTTP. The text \"may make sense\"\nsounds as if character negotiation in HTTP doesn't really make\nthat much sense. It should probably be \"For such cases, it may make sense...\".\n\n\n>     Note that a character set is an absolute; for almost all languages\n>     but English and a few other Latin-based scripts, text cannot be\n>     rendered comprehensibly without supporting the right character\n>     set.\n\nPlease remove the \"for almost ...\". Even for English, if you don't\nknow whether it's EBCDIC or ASCII, you are not comprehensible.\n\n\n\n>     4.  Languages\n\n\n>     4.1.  The need for language information\n\n>     All human-readable text has a language.\n\n>     Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n>     synthesis, searching, sorting, spellchecking and so on need access\n>     to information about the language of a piece of text. [WC\n>     3.1.1.4].\n\nCan we please eliminate sorting? I don't know why this gets repeated\nlike a virus. Adding hyphenation may be a good idea. Even if it's\nsubsumed under \"high quality formatting\", it's something that is\nvery easy to understand.\n\nAs for spellchecking, I wonder how much this is appropriate here.\nOf course language has to be considered when spellchecking, but\nspellchecking is done at the origin of some text usually. Or\nmaybe somebody wants to build up a SSCP (simple spell checking\nprotocol)?\n\n\n\n>     Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are\n>     generally dissatisfied with being presented text in a language\n>     they do not understand; this is why negotiation of language is\n>     needed.\n\n\"generally dissatisfied\" is not the most important point. Presenting\ntext in a language that is not understood is like presenting no\ninformation, i.e. it is useless. The degree of satisfaction this\ncreates is rather secondary.\n\n\n>     (Some items, like domain names and other names, may in some cases\n>     be very useful without this information.)\n\nThis should be strengthened. Domain names and such are not only\nvery useful without language information, adding language information\nto domain names would in fact completely break their functionality.\n\n\n\n>     The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n>     instance, if I compare \"hosta(lang=en)\" to \"hosta(lang=no)\" I will\n>     generally expect a match, while \"aasmund\" sorts after \"attaboy\"\n>     according to Norwegian rules, but before it using English rules.\n>     (the \"aa\" is sorted together with \"latin letter a with ring\n>     above\", which is at the end of the Norwegian alphabet).\n\nAgain here, sorting is a non-starter. Nobody would like to see\nsomething like\n\naasmund(lang=en)\nattaboy\naasmund(lang=no)\n\nIf you want examples for complex interaction, I can provide a few,\nin particular from the domain of high-quality rendering.\n\n\n>     4.2.  How to identify a language\n\n>     The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n>     available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n>     or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n>     the document.\n\nI think it would be good to add a litle paragraph about hierarchical\ntags and the use of these hierarchies in protocols. Something like\n\nRFC 1766 language tags are hierarchical; in some cases, this hierarchy\ncan be used beneficially. Procotols SHOULD specify how they deal\nwith language tag hierarchies.\n\n\n>     4.3.  Considerations for negotiation\n\n>     Protocols that transfer human-readable text MUST provide for\n>     multiple languages.\n\nSee Ken's comment on how this should be changed.\n\n\n>     In some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n>     languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n>     cases, supplying information in all available languages is a\n>     better solution; most sites will either have very few languages\n>     installed or be willing to pay the overhead of sending error\n>     messages in many languages at once.\n\nI think this is going the wrong way. It is indeed true that many\nsites will have very few languages. But it is definitely not true\nthat they are willing to pay the overhead, and in particular not\ntrue that the recipient is willing to pay the overhead.\nPunishing those sites that go a long way to add many languages\nis the wrong way, we should make it easy to add languages.\n\n\n\n>     4.4.  Default Language\n\n>     When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n>     sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n>     (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n>     negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n>     The Default Language is English, since this is the language which\n>     most people will be able to get adequate help in interpreting when\n>     working with computers.\n\n>     Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n>     Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n>     situations.\n\nVery good! This makes English the default where really needed, but\nnot more.\n\n\n>     5.

But not realy appropriate. Both syllabic and\nideographic characters are called characters, both in everyday\nusage and in standards terminology. They are usually not called\nletters, but that's a different issue.\n\n\n>  > It is very clear that the parameter name \"charset\" should not\n>  > be changed at all.

Introduction\n\n    The Internet is international.\n\n    With the international Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n    interchange data in a multiplicity of languages, which in turn\n    utilize a bewildering number of characters or other character-like\n    representation mechanisms.\n\n    This document is (INTENDED TO BE) the current policies being\n    applied by the Internet Engineering Steering Group towards the\n    standardization efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force in\n    order to help Internet protocols fulfil these requirements.\n\n    The document is very much based upon the recommendations of the\n    IAB Character Set Workshop of February 29-March 1, 1996, which is\n    documented in RFC 2130 [WR]. This document attempts to be concise,\n    explicit and clear; people wanting more background are encouraged\n    to read RFC 2130.\n\n    The document uses the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\" and \"MAY\", and their\n    negatives, in the way described in [RFC 2119]. In this case, \"the\n    specification\" as used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing of\n    protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.\n\n\n    2.  Where to do internationalization\n\n    Internationalization is for humans. This means that protocols are\n    not subject to internationalization; text strings are. Where\n    protocols may masquerade as text strings, such as in many IETF\n    application layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts\n    are protocol and which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n\n    Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many\n    of them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak\n    out of the local context at times. RFC 1958 [ARCH] recommends US-\n    ASCII for all globally visible names.\n\n    This document does not mandate a policy on name\n    internationalization, but requires that all protocols describe\n    whether names are internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 2]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    3.  Character sets\n\n    For a definition of the term \"character set\", refer to the\n    workshop report. Like MIME, this document uses it to mean the\n    combination of a coded character set and a character encoding\n    scheme.\n\n\n    3.1.  What character set to use\n\n    All protocols MUST identify, for all character data, which\n    character set is in use.\n\n    Protocols MUST be able to use the ISO 10646 coded character set,\n    with the UTF-8 character encoding scheme, for all text. (This is\n    called \"UTF-8\" in the rest of this document)\n\n    They MAY specify how to use other character sets or other\n    character encoding schemes, such as UTF-16, but lack of an ability\n    to use UTF-8 needs clear and solid justification in the protocol\n    specification document before being entered into or advanced upon\n    the standards track.\n\n    For existing protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n    datastores, support of other character sets, or even using a\n    default other than UTF-8, may be a requirement. This is\n    acceptable, but UTF-8 support MUST be possible.\n\n    When using other character sets than UTF-8, these MUST be\n    registered in the IANA character set registry, if necessary by\n    registering them when the protocol is published.\n\n\n    3.2.  How to decide a character set\n\n    In some cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n    communication between the producer and the consumer of a character\n    set. In this case, it may make sense to negotiate a character set\n    before sending data.\n\n    In other cases, like E-mail or stored data, there is no such\n    communication, and the best one can do is to make sure the\n    character set is clearly identified with the stored data, and\n    choosing a character set that is as widely known as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 3]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    Note that a character set is an absolute; for almost all languages\n    but English and a few other Latin-based scripts, text cannot be\n    rendered comprehensibly without supporting the right character\n    set.\n\n    Negotiating a character set may be regarded as an interim\n    mechanism that is to be supported until UTF-8 support is\n    prevalent; however, the timeframe of \"interim\" may be at least 50\n    years, so there is every reason to think of it as permanent in\n    practice.\n\n\n    4.  Languages\n\n\n    4.1.  The need for language information\n\n    All human-readable text has a language.\n\n    Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n    synthesis, searching, sorting, spellchecking and so on need access\n    to information about the language of a piece of text. [WC\n    3.1.1.4].\n\n    Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are\n    generally dissatisfied with being presented text in a language\n    they do not understand; this is why negotiation of language is\n    needed.\n\n    In most cases, machines cannot deduce the language by themselves;\n    the protocol must specify how to transfer the language information\n    if it is to be available at all.\n\n    (Some items, like domain names and other names, may in some cases\n    be very useful without this information.)\n\n    The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n    instance, if I compare \"hosta(lang=en)\" to \"hosta(lang=no)\" I will\n    generally expect a match, while \"aasmund\" sorts after \"attaboy\"\n    according to Norwegian rules, but before it using English rules.\n    (the \"aa\" is sorted together with \"latin letter a with ring\n    above\", which is at the end of the Norwegian alphabet).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 4]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    4.2.  How to identify a language\n\n    The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n    available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n    or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n    the document.\n\n\n    4.3.  Considerations for negotiation\n\n    Protocols that transfer human-readable text MUST provide for\n    multiple languages.\n\n    In some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n    cases, supplying information in all available languages is a\n    better solution; most sites will either have very few languages\n    installed or be willing to pay the overhead of sending error\n    messages in many languages at once.\n\n    Negotiation is useful in the case where one side of the protocol\n    exchange is able to present text in multiple languages to the\n    other side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\n    the most common example is the text part of error responses, or\n    Web pages that are available in multiple languages.\n\n    Negotiating a language should be regarded as a permanent\n    requirement of the protocol that will not go away at any time in\n    the future.\n\n    In most cases, it should be possible to include it as part of the\n    connection establishment, together with authentication and other\n    preferences negotiation.\n\n\n    4.4.  Default Language\n\n    When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n    sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n    (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n    negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n    The Default Language is English, since this is the language which\n    most people will be able to get adequate help in interpreting when\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 5]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    working with computers.\n\n    Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n    Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n    situations.\n\n\n    5.  Locale\n\n    POSIX defines a concept called a \"locale\", which includes a lot of\n    information about collating order, date format, currency format\n    and so on.\n\n    In some cases, and especially with text where the user is expected\n    to do processing on the text, locale information may be usefully\n    attached to the text.\n\n    This document does not require the communication of locale\n    information on all text, but encourages its inclusion when\n    appropriate.\n\n    Note that the language and character set will often be present as\n    parts of a locale tag (such as no_NO.iso-8859-1; the language is\n    before the _ and the character set is after the dot); care must be\n    taken to define precisely which specification of character set and\n    language applies to any one text item.\n\n    The default locale is the POSIX locale.\n\n\n    6.  Security considerations\n\n    Apart from the fact that security warnings in a foreign language\n    may cause inappropriate behaviour from the user, and the fact that\n    multilingual systems usually have problems with consistency\n    between language variants, no security considerations relevant\n    have been identified.\n\n\n    7.

One way of constructing a MIME charset\nis to combine a CCS with an invertible CES (note that a CCS and\nnon-invertible CES is *not* a MIME charset).  While CCS and CES are useful\nconcepts for people who build character sets; the MIME charset concept is\nthe useful concept when presenting plain text.\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

I think it's fair to say that MIME part II (RFC 2046)\ndoes a good job at trying to give examlpes of what is and what is not part\nof plain text, and that it can be left at that.\n\nAs an example, the \"stacking of several characters in the same position\"\nis allowed. This takes care of cases such as Tibetan, Hebrew and Arabic\nwith points, Thai, and most of decomposed Latin/Greek/... Strictly\nspeaking, it does not take care of character inversion or surrounding\nsuch as it occurs in most Brahmi-related scripts in South Asia.\nBut these are neither forbidden, and so it's rather reasonable to\nassume that they are allowed, because they are just the application\nof the concept of plain text to these languages/scripts, and the\nway these scripts have been coded for years. Similarly, zero-width\nnon-joiner can be subsumed by this because it is a very similar\nconcept, in this case for Persian. If the MIME specification would\nhave decided that such things are unacceptable (while stacking\nis allowed), it would have said so.\n\nSo as a conclusion, we can say that MIME tries to distinguish between\ncharacters useful for plain text and characters/formatting associated\nto rich text. It does a pretty good job giving explicit examlpes for\nboth, but leaves some area open, so that phenomena unknown to it's\nauthors are not ruled out if they make sense. Given the variety of\nphenomena that exist in writing, this is a rather sensible approach.\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It just isn't all that likely.\n\nThe point is that when I see traffic appear from a list that has been delayed I\nfor one assume that the delay was a problem that has now been fixed.

I may\neven contact the list manager and ask if there's a problem that has gone\nunnoticed. I do not, however, go off and post messages both to the list as well\nas to other, unrelated lists yammering about issues that are entirely unrelated\nto the list topic.

Actually, this already has been done, in a somewhat wider\nframework. Please look for iso-2022-jp-2 in the IANA charset registry.\n\nMaybe this is too wide for your purposes. In this case, it is\nprobably better to define something new (such as iso-2022-jp-1,\niso-2022-jp-3, or iso-2022-jp-212), because most current\nimplementations that know about iso-2022-jp will not react\ngracefully if they receive JIS 212 characters. Also, iso-2022-jp,\nin its current version, has been included as Appendix 2 (normative)\nin JIS X 0208:1997. A sudden change of the meaning of the label\nwould only lead to confusion. At last, there is the IETF definition\nand the registration procedures for charset (currently being worked\non). I don't think that these allow, or should allow, such\ndrastic changes/additions to an existing \"charset\" as you are\nproposing.\n\nI am forwarding this mail to authors of the RFCs for iso-2022-jp\nand iso-2022-jp-2, to the chair of the JIS 208 commitee, as well\nas to the charset list where discussions about new charsets\nare taking place.\n\nWith kind regards,      Martin.\n\n----\nDr.sc.

Introduction\n\n    The Internet is international.\n\n    With the international Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n    interchange data in a multiplicity of languages, which in turn\n    utilize a bewildering number of characters.\n\n    This document is (INTENDED TO BE) the current policies being\n    applied by the Internet Engineering Steering Group towards the\n    standardization efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force in\n    order to help Internet protocols fulfil these requirements.\n\n    The document is very much based upon the recommendations of the\n    IAB Character Set Workshop of February 29-March 1, 1996, which is\n    documented in RFC 2130 [WR]. This document attempts to be concise,\n    explicit and clear; people wanting more background are encouraged\n    to read RFC 2130.\n\n    The document uses the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\" and \"MAY\", and their\n    negatives, in the way described in [RFC 2119]. In this case, \"the\n    specification\" as used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing of\n    protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.\n\n\n    2.  Where to do internationalization\n\n    Internationalization is for humans. This means that protocols are\n    not subject to internationalization; text strings are. Where\n    protocols may masquerade as text strings, such as in many IETF\n    application layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts\n    are protocol and which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n\n    Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many\n    of them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak\n    out of the local context at times. RFC 1958 [ARCH] recommends US-\n    ASCII for all globally visible names.\n\n    This document does not mandate a policy on name\n    internationalization, but requires that all protocols describe\n    whether names are internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 2]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    3.  Definition of Terms\n\n    This document uses the term \"charset\" to mean a set of rules for\n    mapping from a sequence of octets to a sequence of characters,\n    such as the combination of a coded character set and a character\n    encoding scheme; this is also what is used as an identifier in\n    MIME \"charset=\" parameters, and registered in the IANA charset\n    registry [REG].\n\n    For a definition of the term \"coded character set\", refer to the\n    workshop report.\n\n    A \"name\" is an identifier such as a person's name, a hostname, a\n    domainname, a filename or an E-mail address; it is often treated\n    as an identifier rather than as a piece of text, and is often used\n    in protocols as an identifier for entities, without surrounding\n    text.\n\n\n    3.1.  What charset to use\n\n    All protocols MUST identify, for all character data, which charset\n    is in use.\n\n    Protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8 charset, which consists of\n    the ISO 10646 coded character set combined with the UTF-8\n    character encoding scheme, as defined in [10646] Annex R\n    (published in Amendment 2), for all text.\n\n    They MAY specify how to use other charsets or other character\n    encoding schemes for ISO 10646, such as UTF-16, but lack of an\n    ability to use UTF-8 needs clear and solid justification in the\n    protocol specification document before being entered into or\n    advanced upon the standards track.\n\n    For existing protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n    datastores, support of other charsets, or even using a default\n    other than UTF-8, may be a requirement. This is acceptable, but\n    UTF-8 support MUST be possible.\n\n    When using other charsets than UTF-8, these MUST be registered in\n    the IANA charset registry, if necessary by registering them when\n    the protocol is published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 3]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    (Note: ISO 10646 calls the UTF-8 CES a \"Transfer Format\" rather\n    than a \"character encoding scheme\", but it fits the charset report\n    definition of a character encoding scheme).\n\n\n\n    3.2.  How to decide a charset\n\n    In some cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n    communication between the producer and the consumer of data\n    containing text. In such cases, it may make sense to negotiate a\n    charset before sending data.\n\n    In other cases, like E-mail or stored data, there is no such\n    communication, and the best one can do is to make sure the charset\n    is clearly identified with the stored data, and choosing a charset\n    that is as widely known as possible.\n\n    Note that a charset is an absolute; text that is encoded in a\n    charset cannot be rendered comprehensibly without supporting that\n    charset.\n\n    (This also applies to English; charsets like EBCDIC do NOT have\n    ASCII as a proper subset)\n\n    Negotiating a charset may be regarded as an interim mechanism that\n    is to be supported until UTF-8 support is prevalent; however, the\n    timeframe of \"interim\" may be at least 50 years, so there is every\n    reason to think of it as permanent in practice.\n\n\n    4.  Languages\n\n\n    4.1.  The need for language information\n\n    All human-readable text has a language.\n\n    Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n    synthesis, searching, hyphenation, spellchecking and so on need\n    access to information about the language of a piece of text. [WC\n    3.1.1.4].\n\n    Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 4]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    generally very unhappy with being presented text in a language\n    they do not understand; this is why negotiation of language is\n    needed.\n\n    In most cases, machines cannot deduce the language of a\n    transmitted text by themselves; the protocol must specify how to\n    transfer the language information if it is to be available at all.\n\n    The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n    instance, if I compare \"name-of-thing(lang=en)\" to \"name-of-\n    thing(lang=no)\" for equality, I will generally expect a match,\n    while the word \"ask(no)\" is a kind of tree, and is hardly useful\n    as a command verb.\n\n\n    4.2.  Requirement for language tagging\n\n    Protocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying information\n    about the language of that text.\n\n    Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n    language of names.\n\n    Note that this does NOT mean that such information must always be\n    present; the requirement is that if the sender of information\n    wishes to send information about the language of a text, the\n    protocol provides a well-defined way to carry this information.\n\n\n    4.3.  How to identify a language\n\n    The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n    available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n    or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n    the document.\n\n    In particular, claiming that a language can be deduced from the\n    charset in use is erroneous and will not be accepted.\n\n    Note also that a language is distinct from a POSIX locale; a POSIX\n    locale identifies a set of cultural conventions, which may imply a\n    language (the POSIX or \"C\" locale of course do not), while a\n    language tag as described in RFC 1766 identifies only a language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 5]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    4.4.  Considerations for negotiation\n\n    Protocols where users have text presented to them in response to\n    user actions MUST provide for multiple languages.\n\n    In some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n    cases, supplying information in all available languages is a\n    better solution; most sites will either have very few languages\n    installed or be willing to pay the overhead of sending error\n    messages in many languages at once.\n\n    Negotiation is useful in the case where one side of the protocol\n    exchange is able to present text in multiple languages to the\n    other side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\n    the most common example is the text part of error responses, or\n    Web pages that are available in multiple languages.\n\n    Negotiating a language should be regarded as a permanent\n    requirement of the protocol that will not go away at any time in\n    the future.\n\n    In many cases, it should be possible to include it as part of the\n    connection establishment, together with authentication and other\n    preferences negotiation.\n\n\n    4.5.  Default Language\n\n    When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n    sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n    (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n    negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n    The Default Language is English, since this is the language which\n    most people will be able to get adequate help in interpreting when\n    working with computers.\n\n    Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n    Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n    situations. It may be appropriate for application designers to\n    make sure that messages in Default Language are understandable to\n    people with a limited understanding of the English language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 6]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    5.  Locale\n\n    The POSIX standard [POSIX] defines a concept called a \"locale\",\n    which includes a lot of information about collating order for\n    sorting, date format, currency format and so on.\n\n    In some cases, and especially with text where the user is expected\n    to do processing on the text, locale information may be usefully\n    attached to the text; this would identify the sender's opinion\n    about appropriate rules to follow when processing the document,\n    which the recipient may choose to agree with or ignore.\n\n    This document does not require the communication of locale\n    information on all text, but encourages its inclusion when\n    appropriate.\n\n    Note that language and character set information will often be\n    present as parts of a locale tag (such as no_NO.iso-8859-1; the\n    language is before the underscore and the character set is after\n    the dot); care must be taken to define precisely which\n    specification of character set and language applies to any one\n    text item.\n\n    The default locale is the \"POSIX\" locale.\n\n\n    6.  Security considerations\n\n    Apart from the fact that security warnings in a foreign language\n    may cause inappropriate behaviour from the user, and the fact that\n    multilingual systems usually have problems with consistency\n    between language variants, no security considerations relevant\n    have been identified.\n\n\n    7.

            "content": "Hello everybody,\n\nIn the charset policy BOF at the recent IETF meeting in Munich,\nchaired by Harald Alvestrand, he showed a slide with variants\nof Han characters (Kanji) that are unified in Unicode/ISO 10646,\nbut which may be problematic. He also showed this list in his\nplenary talk presenting the planned IETF charset policy.\nThis list has been published on page 885 (explanatory page 7),\nbottom, of JIS X 0221-1995, the Japanese translation of ISO\n10646 (explanatory material not contained in the original),\nand probably elsewhere.\n\nIn the BOF, I commented on this. I said that these were indeed\nmostly character components that turned up in many characters,\nand that a high percentage of them was explicitly unified by\nthe new version of the base Japanese Kanji standard,\nJIS X 0208:1997. I mentionned a figure of something like 90\nor 95%, which turns out to be too high if one counts cases,\nbut probably correct if one counts the characters affected\n(see below).\n\nTo this, Masataka Ohta strongly protested, saying something\nto the effect that he had been on the commitee developping\nthat standard. I have now had time to look at JIS X 208:1997\nagain. On page 399 (explanatory page 25), it lists the members\nof the two commitees involved. On the following page, it gives\nadditional acknowledgements. Whatever that may mean, I have\nnot been able to find the name Masataka Ohta on these pages.\n[my name turns up at the end of the text on page 400, as one\nof the contributors to the public review done by the commitee,\nin the form Duerst, Martin J.]\n\nIn the case that I have missed Masataka Ohta's name somewhere\nin JIS X 208:1997, I would like him to give us the exact page,\nand if necessary line number, to verify. In the case he has\nindeed participated, but has for some reason be forgotten,\nI ask the chair of both commitees listed on page 399, Prof.\nShibano, to tell us how Masataka Ohta has been involved.\n\n\n\nNow for the list that Harald has shown.

You can't have\na MUST and then a MAYbe not on the same point. Either make the\nfirst a SHOULD, or make a MUST for ISO 10646/Unicode, and then\na SHOULD for UTF-8.\n\n\n>    4.  Languages\n\n\n>    4.1.  The need for language information\n\n>    All human-readable text has a language.\n\n>    Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n>    synthesis, searching, hyphenation, spellchecking and so on need\n>    access to information about the language of a piece of text. [WC\n>    3.1.1.4].\n\nI would suggest replacing \"need access\" to \"benefits from\".\nThis better expresses the fact that a lot of these things\nis also possible without explicit language information,\nand that even the presence of language information doesn't\nmake these things perfect.\n\n\n>    In most cases, machines cannot deduce the language of a\n>    transmitted text by themselves;\n\nThis is not true. There is enough evidence that for any given\nset of languages, it is possible to devise or generate software\nthat identifies the language with accuracy converging to 100%\nas the length of the text increases, and as the amount of\neffort (e.g. table/dictionary size,...) increases. And once\nthis effort is done, the gap between what humans can find out\nand what machines can find out is small.\n\n\n> the protocol must specify how to\n>    transfer the language information if it is to be available at all.\n\n\n\n>    The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n>    instance, if I compare \"name-of-thing(lang=en)\" to \"name-of-\n>    thing(lang=no)\" for equality, I will generally expect a match,\n>    while the word \"ask(no)\" is a kind of tree, and is hardly useful\n>    as a command verb.\n\nGood point!\n\nPlease add the following:\n\n   Please note that language information as such is not needed\n   for the end user; humans have no problem identifying the\n   languages they know and separating them from those they\n   don't know.\n\n   Please note that languages are not as clearcut a concept as\n   character sets. There are mixtures of languages, language\n   variants, words that move from one language to another,\n   and text parts that are not in any particular language.\n\n\n>    4.2.  Requirement for language tagging\n\n>    Protocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying information\n>    about the language of that text.\n\nThis is most probably too strong.\n\nWhat about:\n\nProtocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying language\ninformation to the extend and in the granularity that this is\nnecessary and apropriate for the operations that the text in\nthe protocol is generally intended and used for.\n\n\n>    Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n>    language of names.\n\nDo you seriously want to suggest that we devise some kind of\nlanguage-tag syntax for URLs, Email addresses, host names, and\nso on?\n\nMy objection is not that the syntax for these things is already\nhopelessly on the edge; let's just assume we could have a new\nstart.\n\nAs you have said above, you want to ignore language when\ncomparing names for equality. This makes a lot of sense.\nAlso, names often appear on paper. Noting the language there\nis a strong burden, without much benefit. If names are carried\nas part of other text, then using that mechanism for giving\nlanguage information should be perfectly appropriate. For\nnames in isolation, language information doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n>    Note that this does NOT mean that such information must always be\n>    present; the requirement is that if the sender of information\n>    wishes to send information about the language of a text, the\n>    protocol provides a well-defined way to carry this information.\n\nGood point.\n\n\n>    4.3.  How to identify a language\n\n>    The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n>    available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n>    or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n>    the document.\n\n>    In particular, claiming that a language can be deduced from the\n>    charset in use is erroneous and will not be accepted.\n\nCorrect. But isn't this all too obvious, given things like\niso-8859-1? I don't think you need this in any way to be able\nto reject such claims should they ever come up.\n\n\n>    4.4.  Considerations for negotiation\n\nPlease say \"language negotiation\". I get the impression, also\nat other points, that Norwegian relies more on implicit things\nthan (American) English :-).\n\n\n>    Protocols where users have text presented to them in response to\n>    user actions MUST provide for multiple languages.\n\nThis is too sweeping. Some people could think that it means that\na protocol must provide at least two languages, or that every\nimplementation has to provide multiple languages.\n\nPlease say something like:\n\n   Protocols where users have text presented to them in response\n   to user actions MUST provide the means by which implementors\n   can satisfy the language needs of the users.\n\n\n>    In some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n>    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n>    cases, supplying information in all available languages is a\n>    better solution; most sites will either have very few languages\n>    installed or be willing to pay the overhead of sending error\n>    messages in many languages at once.\n\nI don't agree. There may be only few sites that have many\nlanguages available, but those may be contacted by users\nwith special language needs that can't afford the bandwidth\n(even if the server side providing these many languages has\nno problem with the bandwith).\nAlso, there is an increasing tendency for products to ship\nwith all language versions integrated. For a NS or MS server,\nyou won't by a specific language version anymore very soon\nin the future.\n\n\n>    Negotiation is useful in the case where one side of the protocol\n>    exchange is able to present text in multiple languages to the\n>    other side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\n>    the most common example is the text part of error responses, or\n>    Web pages that are available in multiple languages.\n\nThe \"one side is able\" is somewhat dangerous here. A WG may\njust come and tell you: Our servers all just do English,\nthe are not able to do anything else, so this doesn't apply.\n\n\n>    4.5.  Default Language\n\n>    When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n>    sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n>    (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n>    negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n>    The Default Language is English, since this is the language which\n>    most people will be able to get adequate help in interpreting when\n>    working with computers.\n\nIt may be a good idea to replace \"most people\" by \"the greatest number\nof people\". This is a sensitive spot, and \"most people\" is saying\nsomething about their absolute percentage, whereas we just need to\nsay that it is better than any other language we could pick.\n\n\n>    Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n>    Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n>    situations. It may be appropriate for application designers to\n>    make sure that messages in Default Language are understandable to\n>    people with a limited understanding of the English language.\n\nThe following is implicit here, but has led to prolonged discussions\non some lists:\n\nWhat I think the text above says is that it's not permitted to\nsay: \"If the client doesn't negotiate language, this defaults to\nEnglish (or whatever other \"default\" language).\"\n\nIf this is the case, it would be better to explicitly state:\n\n   Protocols MUST NOT define a default language to avoid language\n   negotiation; language MUST be explicitly negotiated for all\n   languages.\n\nI think it's better to make this clear, if this is what is desired,\nand something else otherwise, than to have more such discussions.\n\n>    5.  Locale\n\n>    In some cases, and especially with text where the user is expected\n>    to do processing on the text, locale information may be usefully\n>    attached to the text; this would identify the sender's opinion\n>    about appropriate rules to follow when processing the document,\n>    which the recipient may choose to agree with or ignore.\n\n>    This document does not require the communication of locale\n>    information on all text, but encourages its inclusion when\n>    appropriate.\n\nThe above is not very clearcut, but there is probably nothing\nbetter in sight.\n\n\nPlease add something like the following:\n\n   6. Documentation\n\n   Protocols MUST appropriately document the decisions they have\n   taken with respect to charsets, language information, and other\n   aspects related to internationalization and multilinguality.\n   A format such as that currently used for Security Issues is\n   (highly) recommended.\n\n\nAnother thing, which should probably go into section 2 or so,\nand which seems needed as a response to some of the questions\nin the plenary in Munich, is a clarification of which protocol\nin a protocol stack is responsible for charset and language\ninformation. I'm not sure that I have found the best way\nto express this, but it could read as follows:\n\n   Note that in a protocol stack, it is the responsibility of\n   the highest layer that uses the text to appropriately label\n   it. As an example, it is the responsibility of the standard\n   for mail messages to assure things get correctly labeled in\n   mail messages, even if those are sent over SMTP. It is the\n   responsibility of SMTP to correctly label text which is\n   exchanged as part of the SMTP protocol and is intended for\n   end-user consumption, even if SMTP is run over TCP/IP.\n   It would be the responsibility of IP to label text correctly\n   if it ever would consider using text in its protocol elements\n   (as opposed to transporting text in its payload).\n\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n--Boundary_(ID_Noa+eycIcA9/6cgfZqLLFw)\nContent-id: <8600.872853302.2@dale.uninett.no>\nContent-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=us-ascii\nContent-description:\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n               IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages\n\n                     Fri Aug 29 10:41:03 MET DST 1997\n\n\n                         Harald Tveit Alvestrand\n                                 UNINETT\n                      Harald.T.Alvestrand@uninett.no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Status of this Memo\n\n    This draft document is being circulated for comment.\n\n    Please send comments to the author, or to the mailing list <ietf-\n    charsets@innosoft.com>\n\n    The following text is required by the Internet-draft rules:\n\n    This document is an Internet Draft.

Introduction\n\n    The Internet is international.\n\n    With the international Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n    interchange data in a multiplicity of languages, which in turn\n    utilize a bewildering number of characters.\n\n    This document is (INTENDED TO BE) the current policies being\n    applied by the Internet Engineering Steering Group towards the\n    standardization efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force in\n    order to help Internet protocols fulfil these requirements.\n\n    The document is very much based upon the recommendations of the\n    IAB Character Set Workshop of February 29-March 1, 1996, which is\n    documented in RFC 2130 [WR]. This document attempts to be concise,\n    explicit and clear; people wanting more background are encouraged\n    to read RFC 2130.\n\n    The document uses the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\" and \"MAY\", and their\n    negatives, in the way described in [RFC 2119]. In this case, \"the\n    specification\" as used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing of\n    protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.\n\n\n    2.  Where to do internationalization\n\n    Internationalization is for humans. This means that protocols are\n    not subject to internationalization; text strings are. Where\n    protocols may masquerade as text strings, such as in many IETF\n    application layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts\n    are protocol and which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n\n    Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many\n    of them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak\n    out of the local context at times. RFC 1958 [ARCH] recommends US-\n    ASCII for all globally visible names.\n\n    This document does not mandate a policy on name\n    internationalization, but requires that all protocols describe\n    whether names are internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 2]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    3.  Definition of Terms\n\n    This document uses the term \"charset\" to mean a set of rules for\n    mapping from a sequence of octets to a sequence of characters,\n    such as the combination of a coded character set and a character\n    encoding scheme; this is also what is used as an identifier in\n    MIME \"charset=\" parameters, and registered in the IANA charset\n    registry [REG].\n\n    For a definition of the term \"coded character set\", refer to the\n    workshop report.\n\n    A \"name\" is an identifier such as a person's name, a hostname, a\n    domainname, a filename or an E-mail address; it is often treated\n    as an identifier rather than as a piece of text, and is often used\n    in protocols as an identifier for entities, without surrounding\n    text.\n\n\n    3.1.  What charset to use\n\n    All protocols MUST identify, for all character data, which charset\n    is in use.\n\n    Protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8 charset, which consists of\n    the ISO 10646 coded character set combined with the UTF-8\n    character encoding scheme, as defined in [10646] Annex R\n    (published in Amendment 2), for all text.\n\n    They MAY specify how to use other charsets or other character\n    encoding schemes for ISO 10646, such as UTF-16, but lack of an\n    ability to use UTF-8 needs clear and solid justification in the\n    protocol specification document before being entered into or\n    advanced upon the standards track.\n\n    For existing protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n    datastores, support of other charsets, or even using a default\n    other than UTF-8, may be a requirement. This is acceptable, but\n    UTF-8 support MUST be possible.\n\n    When using other charsets than UTF-8, these MUST be registered in\n    the IANA charset registry, if necessary by registering them when\n    the protocol is published.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 3]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    (Note: ISO 10646 calls the UTF-8 CES a \"Transfer Format\" rather\n    than a \"character encoding scheme\", but it fits the charset report\n    definition of a character encoding scheme).\n\n\n\n    3.2.  How to decide a charset\n\n    In some cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n    communication between the producer and the consumer of data\n    containing text. In such cases, it may make sense to negotiate a\n    charset before sending data.\n\n    In other cases, like E-mail or stored data, there is no such\n    communication, and the best one can do is to make sure the charset\n    is clearly identified with the stored data, and choosing a charset\n    that is as widely known as possible.\n\n    Note that a charset is an absolute; text that is encoded in a\n    charset cannot be rendered comprehensibly without supporting that\n    charset.\n\n    (This also applies to English; charsets like EBCDIC do NOT have\n    ASCII as a proper subset)\n\n    Negotiating a charset may be regarded as an interim mechanism that\n    is to be supported until UTF-8 support is prevalent; however, the\n    timeframe of \"interim\" may be at least 50 years, so there is every\n    reason to think of it as permanent in practice.\n\n\n    4.  Languages\n\n\n    4.1.  The need for language information\n\n    All human-readable text has a language.\n\n    Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n    synthesis, searching, hyphenation, spellchecking and so on need\n    access to information about the language of a piece of text. [WC\n    3.1.1.4].\n\n    Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 4]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    generally very unhappy with being presented text in a language\n    they do not understand; this is why negotiation of language is\n    needed.\n\n    In most cases, machines cannot deduce the language of a\n    transmitted text by themselves; the protocol must specify how to\n    transfer the language information if it is to be available at all.\n\n    The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n    instance, if I compare \"name-of-thing(lang=en)\" to \"name-of-\n    thing(lang=no)\" for equality, I will generally expect a match,\n    while the word \"ask(no)\" is a kind of tree, and is hardly useful\n    as a command verb.\n\n\n    4.2.  Requirement for language tagging\n\n    Protocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying information\n    about the language of that text.\n\n    Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n    language of names.\n\n    Note that this does NOT mean that such information must always be\n    present; the requirement is that if the sender of information\n    wishes to send information about the language of a text, the\n    protocol provides a well-defined way to carry this information.\n\n\n    4.3.  How to identify a language\n\n    The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n    available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n    or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n    the document.\n\n    In particular, claiming that a language can be deduced from the\n    charset in use is erroneous and will not be accepted.\n\n    Note also that a language is distinct from a POSIX locale; a POSIX\n    locale identifies a set of cultural conventions, which may imply a\n    language (the POSIX or \"C\" locale of course do not), while a\n    language tag as described in RFC 1766 identifies only a language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 5]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    4.4.  Considerations for negotiation\n\n    Protocols where users have text presented to them in response to\n    user actions MUST provide for multiple languages.\n\n    In some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n    cases, supplying information in all available languages is a\n    better solution; most sites will either have very few languages\n    installed or be willing to pay the overhead of sending error\n    messages in many languages at once.\n\n    Negotiation is useful in the case where one side of the protocol\n    exchange is able to present text in multiple languages to the\n    other side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\n    the most common example is the text part of error responses, or\n    Web pages that are available in multiple languages.\n\n    Negotiating a language should be regarded as a permanent\n    requirement of the protocol that will not go away at any time in\n    the future.\n\n    In many cases, it should be possible to include it as part of the\n    connection establishment, together with authentication and other\n    preferences negotiation.\n\n\n    4.5.  Default Language\n\n    When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n    sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n    (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n    negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n    The Default Language is English, since this is the language which\n    most people will be able to get adequate help in interpreting when\n    working with computers.\n\n    Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n    Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n    situations. It may be appropriate for application designers to\n    make sure that messages in Default Language are understandable to\n    people with a limited understanding of the English language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 6]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    5.  Locale\n\n    The POSIX standard [POSIX] defines a concept called a \"locale\",\n    which includes a lot of information about collating order for\n    sorting, date format, currency format and so on.\n\n    In some cases, and especially with text where the user is expected\n    to do processing on the text, locale information may be usefully\n    attached to the text; this would identify the sender's opinion\n    about appropriate rules to follow when processing the document,\n    which the recipient may choose to agree with or ignore.\n\n    This document does not require the communication of locale\n    information on all text, but encourages its inclusion when\n    appropriate.\n\n    Note that language and character set information will often be\n    present as parts of a locale tag (such as no_NO.iso-8859-1; the\n    language is before the underscore and the character set is after\n    the dot); care must be taken to define precisely which\n    specification of character set and language applies to any one\n    text item.\n\n    The default locale is the \"POSIX\" locale.\n\n\n    6.  Security considerations\n\n    Apart from the fact that security warnings in a foreign language\n    may cause inappropriate behaviour from the user, and the fact that\n    multilingual systems usually have problems with consistency\n    between language variants, no security considerations relevant\n    have been identified.\n\n\n    7.

The later is definitely\nunacceptable; the former, which is more or less what I think JRG has\ndone, is an attempt to do their best with limited means. In some cases,\nI think they had handwritten examples instead of 24 dot patterns,\nfor examlpe for the secondary Korean standard, KS C 5657-1991.\nThese have advantages and disadvantages when compared to 24 dots,\nbut probably more advantages than disadvantages.\nIn some sense, many character standard makers are in a bootstrap process,\nwith all the limitations this involves.\n\n\n> > In the case that I have missed Masataka Ohta's name somewhere\n> > in JIS X 208:1997, I would like him to give us the exact page,\n> > and if necessary line number, to verify.

But it is important to understand\nexactly in what sense it is normative. This can be found in\nSection 6.6.1. There, it says that the unifications in 6.6.3\nand 6.6.4 only define the correspondence between the codepoints\n(bit combinations) of the standard and Kanji shapes that are\nin general use, and that it does not define any guideline for\nKanji shapes in general.\nAlso, it says (comment 1) that this normative unification is\nbased on the Mincho font style, and that it is not intended\nto limit the use of other fonts, or to give any kind of\nguideline on fonts.\n\nThe rules are therefore indeed normative, but not in the general\nsense that just saying so might imply. That was my reason\nfor using the term \"examples\", but I agree that this is not\nvery clear.\n\nThe way I understand it is that the commitee looked only at\nMincho and only at existing shapes in widely available fonts.\nMaking guidelines for what *would* be unified if it existed\nwas defined out of scope.\n\nBut if a font designer went and designed a new Mincho\nfont, and decided that in some details, he wanted to deviate\nfrom the area of unification as given in JIS 208:1997, for\nartistic or whatever reasons, he/she would, as far as my\ninterpretation goes, be allowed to do so. It would just be\nhis/her responsibility; unification wouldn't be guaranteed\nby the stanard, but it would also not be outrighly rejected,\ngiven of course that the other rules of the standard (no two\ncodepoints have the same shape, characters can be identified\nwith the information given (starting on p. 63),...).\n\nAs an example, JIS X 0208:1997 forbids the (mechanical)\ncombination of two or more unification rules to deviate\nmore and more from the given examlpe shapes and from\nwhat can be found in existing fonts. However, JIS 208\nwouldn't forbid the same shape if it appeared as the\nresult of the font design process, with all its aestetic\nand other considerations.\n\nIt is of course difficult to tell the difference between\nmechanical extensions and human aestetic creativity. But\nthat can never be done mechanically anyway, and I think\nthe standard does a very good job to make this as clear\nas it is ever possible.\n\nIf this interpretation is not correct, then please tell\nme where I made a mistake.\n\n\nThe above also explains some of the differences between JIS\nX 0208:1997 and ISO/IEC 10646 that I was listing in my mail.\nSome of them are due to the fact that these shape variants\njust don't exist in Japanese fonts, and are therefore\nnot documented is JIS 208. However, they would rather\nnicely fit the general guidelines for unification.\nIt's kind of like the English had a special way to\nwrite A's, which wouldn't be listed in a German standard,\nbecause it's not popular in Germany, but which no German\nwould have difficulties to read as an A.\n\n\n> JIS Kanji Dictionary, which will be published in November,\n\nVery interesting to hear about your JIS Kanji Dictionary.

JIS X 0208-1990 (the predecessor of the standard\nwe are discussing here) lists this case already, as \"difference\nresulting from simplification of drawing sequence\". In today's\nMincho fonts, the difference is indeed on the edge of what one\nwould unify in general, but when one thinks about how these\ntwo variants are drawn by hand, and that they are used inter-\nchangably for the same radical, unification seems to make a\nlot of sense.\nMaybe you can give further explanations?\n\n\n> >     case 3 (3 variants)     153 (JIS 208 lists one more variant)\n\n> This rule come from well known Kanji shape design error of Kangxi dictionary.\n\nMany of today's shapes could be attributed as design errors that\nhappened in the change from the seal script to newer scripts.\nAfter a certain time, an error is not anymore seen as an error.\nIt is of course always difficult to say when that happens.\n\nFor examlpe, one could easily say that unification case 100 was\nan error of Japanese postwar Kanji simplification, because the\ntwo shapes are historically separate, and there are Kanji pairs\n(not very frequent, though) where this difference is the only\nand crucial difference. But for present-day Japanese, this is\nhistory, too.\n\n\n> > With all the comments, it's difficult to exactly say what percentage\n> > this would amount to.

CJK-JRG was the committe who do the han-unification.\n\nISO version of the rule that is an updated version of the JIS description is\navailable as Amendment 8 of ISO/IEC 10646-1.\n\n> In the BOF, I commented on this.

At the time CJK-JRG did the unification, Japan also\ncould not provides sufficient indentification information on each Kanji.\n\nI do not know the availability of some of GB standards. For example, Dr. Yas\nuoka of Kyoto University anvailed mystery behind GB standards.\n\nAs far as I understand, CJK-JRG work only used 24 dots fonts that is not suf\nficient for real unification consideration. Real consideration of unificatio\nn rules requires identification information and very high quality Kanji shap\ne information.\n\nIt is obvious that a complex Kanji shape could not represented in 24 dots.\n\nDuring the course of JIS X 0208 revision, sometimes we use 300 dots scanned\nimage. For example, list of variant implementation shape found in JIS X 0208\n:1997 starting from 401 to 490 is based on 300 dots scanned Kanji shapes.\n\n> To this, Masataka Ohta strongly protested, saying something\n> to the effect that he had been on the commitee developping\n> that standard.

Introduction\n\n   ISO/IEC 10646-1 [ISO-10646] and the Unicode Standard [UNICODE]\n   jointly define a 16-bit character set, UCS-2, which encompasses most\n   of the world's writing systems.  ISO 10646 further defines a 31-bit\n   character set, UCS-4, with currently no assignments outside of the\n   region corresponding to UCS-2 (the Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP).\n   The UCS-2 and UCS-4 encodings, however, are hard to use in many cur-\n   rent applications and protocols that assume 8 or even 7 bit charac-\n   ters.  Even newer systems able to deal with 16 bit characters cannot\n   process UCS-4 data. This situation has led to the development of so-\n   called UCS transformation formats (UTF), each with different charac-\n   teristics.\n\n   UTF-1 has only historical interest, having been removed from ISO\n   10646.  UTF-7 has the quality of encoding the full Unicode repertoire\n   using only octets with the high-order bit clear (7 bit US-ASCII val-\n   ues, [US-ASCII]), and is thus deemed a mail-safe encoding\n   ([RFC1642]).  UTF-8, the object of this memo, uses all bits of an\n   octet, but has the quality of preserving the full US-ASCII range: US-\n   ASCII characters are encoded in one octet having the normal US-ASCII\n   value, and any octet with such a value can only stand for an US-ASCII\n   character, and nothing else.\n\n   UTF-16 is a scheme for transforming a subset of the UCS-4 repertoire\n   into pairs of UCS-2 values from a reserved range.  UTF-16 impacts\n   UTF-8 in that UCS-2 values from the reserved range must be treated\n   specially in the UTF-8 transformation.\n\n   UTF-8 encodes UCS-2 or UCS-4 characters as a varying number of\n   octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on\n   the integer value assigned to the character in ISO 10646.  This\n   transformation format has the following characteristics (all values\n   are in hexadecimal):\n\n   -  Character values from 0000 0000 to 0000 007F (US-ASCII repertoire)\n      correspond to octets 00 to 7F (7 bit US-ASCII values). A direct\n      consequence is that a plain ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8\n      string.\n\n   -  US-ASCII values do not appear otherwise in a UTF-8 encoded charac-\n      ter stream.  This provides compatibility with file systems or\n      other software (e.g. the printf() function in C libraries) that\n      parse based on US-ASCII values but are transparent to other val-\n      ues.\n\n   -  Round-trip conversion is easy between UTF-8 and either of UCS-4,\n      UCS-2 or Unicode.\n\n\n\n                        Expires 28 February 1998        [Page 2]\n\nInternet Draft                    UTF-8                   30 August 1998\n\n\n   -  The first octet of a multi-octet sequence indicates the number of\n      octets in the sequence.\n\n   -  The octet values FE and FF never appear.\n\n   -  Character boundaries are easily found from anywhere in an octet\n      stream.\n\n   -  The lexicographic sorting order of UCS-4 strings is preserved.  Of\n      course this is of limited interest since the sort order is not\n      culturally valid in either case.\n\n   -  The Boyer-Moore fast search algorithm can be used with UTF-8 data.\n\n   -  UTF-8 strings can be fairly reliably recognized as such by a sim-\n      ple algorithm, i.e. the probability that a string of characters in\n      any other encoding appears as valid UTF-8 is low, diminishing with\n      increasing string length.\n\n   UTF-8 was originally a project of the X/Open Joint Internationaliza-\n   tion Group XOJIG with the objective to specify a File System Safe UCS\n   Transformation Format [FSS-UTF] that is compatible with UNIX systems,\n   supporting multilingual text in a single encoding.  The original\n   authors were Gary Miller, Greger Leijonhufvud and John Entenmann.\n   Later, Ken Thompson and Rob Pike did significant work for the formal\n   UTF-8.\n\n   A description can also be found in Unicode Technical Report #4 and in\n   the Unicode Standard, version 2.0 [UNICODE].  The definitive refer-\n   ence, including provisions for UTF-16 data within UTF-8, is Annex R\n   of ISO/IEC 10646-1 [ISO-10646].\n\n2.  UTF-8 definition\n\n   In UTF-8, characters are encoded using sequences of 1 to 6 octets.\n   The only octet of a \"sequence\" of one has the higher-order bit set to\n   0, the remaining 7 bits being used to encode the character value. In\n   a sequence of n octets, n>1, the initial octet has the n higher-order\n   bits set to 1, followed by a bit set to 0.  The remaining bit(s) of\n   that octet contain bits from the value of the character to be\n   encoded.  The following octet(s) all have the higher-order bit set to\n   1 and the following bit set to 0, leaving 6 bits in each to contain\n   bits from the character to be encoded.\n\n   The table below summarizes the format of these different octet types.\n   The letter x indicates bits available for encoding bits of the UCS-4\n   character value.\n\n\n\n\n                        Expires 28 February 1998        [Page 3]\n\nInternet Draft                    UTF-8                   30 August 1998\n\n\n   UCS-4 range (hex.)

It is important to note\n      that the rows of the table are mutually exclusive, i.e. there is\n      only one valid way to encode a given UCS-4 character.\n\n   2) Prepare the high-order bits of the octets as per the second column\n      of the table.\n\n   3) Fill in the bits marked x from the bits of the character value,\n      starting from the lower-order bits of the character value and\n      putting them first in the last octet of the sequence, then the\n      next to last, etc. until all x bits are filled in.\n\n      The algorithm for encoding UCS-2 (or Unicode) to UTF-8 can be\n      obtained from the above, in principle, by simply extending each\n      UCS-2 character with two zero-valued octets.  However, UCS-2 val-\n      ues between D800 and DFFF, being actually UCS-4 characters trans-\n      formed through UTF-16, need special treatment: the UTF-16 trans-\n      formation must be undone, yielding a UCS-4 character that is then\n      transformed as above.\n\n      Decoding from UTF-8 to UCS-4 proceeds as follows:\n\n   1) Initialize the 4 octets of the UCS-4 character with all bits set\n      to 0.\n\n   2) Determine which bits encode the character value from the number of\n      octets in the sequence and the second column of the table above\n      (the bits marked x).\n\n   3) Distribute the bits from the sequence to the UCS-4 character,\n      first the lower-order bits from the last octet of the sequence and\n      proceeding to the left until no x bits are left.\n\n      If the UTF-8 sequence is no more than three octets long, decoding\n      can proceed directly to UCS-2 (or equivalently Unicode).\n\n\n\n                        Expires 28 February 1998        [Page 4]\n\nInternet Draft                    UTF-8                   30 August 1998\n\n\n        NOTE -- actual implementations of the decoding algorithm\n        above should protect against decoding invalid sequences.\n        For instance, a naive implementation may (wrongly) decode\n        the invalid UTF-8 sequence C0 80 into the character U+0000,\n        which may have security consequences and/or cause other\n        problems.  See the Security Considerations section below.\n\n   A more detailed algorithm and formulae can be found in [FSS_UTF],\n   [UNICODE] or Annex R to [ISO-10646].\n\n3.  Versions of the standards\n\n   Different versions of the Unicode standard exist: 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 as\n   of this writing.  Each new version obsoletes and replaces the previ-\n   ous one, but implementations, and more significantly data, are not\n   updated instantly.  Similarly, ISO 10646 is updated from time to time\n   by published amendments, which up to now have tracked the changes in\n   the Unicode standard, so that the two have remained in sync.\n\n   In general, the changes amount to adding new characters, which does\n   not pose particular problems with old data.  Amendment 5 to ISO\n   10646, however, has moved and expanded the Korean Hangul block,\n   thereby making any previous data containing Hangul characters invalid\n   under the new version.  Unicode 2.0 has the same difference from Uni-\n   code 1.1. The official justification for allowing such an incompati-\n   ble change was that no implementations and no data containing Hangul\n   existed, a statement that is likely to be true but remains unprov-\n   able.  The incident has been dubbed the \"Korean mess\", and the rele-\n   vant committees have pledged to never, ever again make such an incom-\n   patible change.\n\n   New versions, and in particular any incompatible changes, have conse-\n   quences regarding MIME character encoding labels, to be discussed in\n   section 5.\n\n4.  Examples\n\n   The UCS-2 sequence \"A<NOT IDENTICAL TO><ALPHA>.\" (0041, 2262, 0391,\n   002E) may be encoded as follows:\n\n   41 E2 89 A2 CE 91 2E\n\n   The UCS-2 sequence representing the Hangul characters for the Korean\n   word \"hangugo\" (D55C, AD6D, C5B4) may be encoded as follows:\n\n   ED 95 9C EA B5 AD EC 96 B4\n\n   The UCS-2 sequence representing the Han characters for the Japanese\n\n\n\n                        Expires 28 February 1998        [Page 5]\n\nInternet Draft                    UTF-8                   30 August 1998\n\n\n   word \"nihongo\" (65E5, 672C, 8A9E) may be encoded as follows:\n\n   E6 97 A5 E6 9C AC E8 AA 9E\n\n\n5.  MIME registration\n\n   This memo is meant to serve as the basis for registration of a MIME\n   character set parameter (charset) [MIME].  The proposed charset\n   parameter value is \"UTF-8\".  This string would label media types con-\n   taining text consisting of characters from the repertoire of ISO/IEC\n   10646 encoded to a sequence of octets using the encoding scheme out-\n   lined above.  UTF-8 is suitable for use in MIME content types under\n   the \"text\" top-level type.\n\n   It is noteworthy that the label \"UTF-8\" does not contain a version\n   identification, referring generically to ISO/IEC 10646.  This is\n   intentional, the rationale being as follows:\n\n   A MIME charset label is designed to give just the information needed\n   to interpret a sequence of bytes received on the wire into a sequence\n   of characters, nothing more (see RFC 2045, section 2.2, in [MIME]).\n   As long as a character set standard does not change incompatibly,\n   version numbers serve no purpose, because one gains nothing by learn-\n   ing from the tag that newly assigned characters may be received that\n   one doesn't know about.  The tag doesn't teach anything about the new\n   characters, and they are going to be received anyway.\n\n   Hence, as long as the standards evolve compatibly, the apparent\n   advantage of having labels that identify the versions is only that,\n   apparent.  But there is a disadvantage to such version-dependent\n   labels: when an older application receives data accompanied by a\n   newer, unknown label, it may fail to recognize the label and be com-\n   pletely unable to deal with the data, whereas a generic, known label\n   would have triggered mostly correct processing of the data, which may\n   well not contain any new characters.\n\n   Now the \"Korean mess\" (ISO 10646 amendment 5) is an incompatible\n   change, in principle contradicting the appropriateness of a version-\n   independent MIME charset label as described above.  But the compati-\n   bility problem can only appear with data containing Korean Hangul\n   characters encoded according to Unicode 1.1 (or equivalently ISO\n   10646 before amendment 5), and there is arguably no such data to\n   worry about, this being the very reason the incompatible change was\n   deemed acceptable.\n\n   In practice, then, a version-independent label is warranted.  Should\n   the need ever arise to distinguish data containing Hangul encoded\n\n\n\n                        Expires 28 February 1998        [Page 6]\n\nInternet Draft                    UTF-8                   30 August 1998\n\n\n   according to Unicode 1.1, then a version-dependent label, for that\n   version only, should be registered (a suggestion would be \"UNI-\n   CODE-1-1-UTF-8\"), in order to retain the advantages of a version-\n   independent label for 2.0 and later versions.  Such a version-depen-\n   dent label could even be registered before actual need arises, pre-\n   emptively, but it is important to strongly recommend against creating\n   any new Hangul-containing data without taking Amendment 5 of ISO\n   10646 into account.\n\n6.  Security Considerations\n\n   Implementors of UTF-8 need to consider the security aspects of how\n   they handle illegal UTF-8 sequences.  It is conceivable that in some\n   circumstances an attacker would be able to exploit an incautious\n   UTF-8 parser by sending it an octet sequence that is not permitted by\n   the UTF-8 syntax.\n\n   A particularly subtle form of this attack could be carried out\n   against a parser which performs security-critical validity checks\n   against the UTF-8 encoded form of its input, but interprets certain\n   illegal octet sequences as characters.  For example, a parser might\n   prohibit the NUL character when encoded as the single-octet sequence\n   00, but allow the illegal two-octet sequence C0 80 and interpret it\n   as a NUL character.  Another example might be a parser which pro-\n   hibits the octet sequence 2F 2E 2E 2F (\"/../\"), yet permits the ille-\n   gal octet sequence 2F C0 AE 2E 2F.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n   The following have participated in the drafting and discussion of\n   this memo:\n\n   James E.

I have only a couple of comments on it:\n\n(1) The discussion of the Hangul mess and versioning is far too\n    wishy-washy. What needs to be said is that the charset label \"UTF-8\" is\n    aligned with the character assignments in Unicode 2.0 or later and that\n    it is NOT aligned with the assignments in Unicode 1.0 or 1.1, in\n    particular the old Hangul range.\n\n    Nowhere does the current document actually say this in so many words,\n    although it can be inferred in section 5. It needs to come out and say it,\n    as otherwise it is likely to be confusing to implementors.\n\n(2) I think you're going to have a significant problem getting this through\n    the IETF process unless you take a stand on what happens should the\n    character assignments in some future Unicode version change in an\n    incompatible way. Yes, I know that promises have been made that this will\n    never happen again, but that's all they are: Promises. The IETF has a\n    policy that it must retain change control over its own standards, and\n    this is a case where someone else effectively has change control over\n    the actual technical core of this specification. I therefore think that\n    this specification needs to say that it aligns automatically with\n    all future versions of Unicode that don't make incompatible changes, but\n    the minute one is made it stays aligned with the old version until and\n    unless the IETF specifically decides otherwise.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

A protocol must be able to handle UTF-8\nif it handles character data. A protocol may elect to handle other charsets as\nwell, possibly including one derived from other transformation formats of\nUnicode.\n\nWhat I do see here is poor ordering of what is being proposed. I suggest\nthat it instead say:\n\n    Protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8 charset, which consists of\n    the ISO 10646 coded character set combined with the UTF-8\n    character encoding scheme, as defined in [10646] Annex R\n    (published in Amendment 2), for all text. Any exceptions\n    must be fully justifiable and the justification must be given in the\n    protocol specification. A protocol which neither supports UTF-8 nor\n    justifies its use of some other charset MUST NOT be entered on the\n    standards track.\n\n    Protocols MAY also specify how to use other charsets or other character\n    encoding schemes for ISO 10646, such as UTF-16. As always, any protocol\n    that elects to support more than one charset MUST provide a field to\n    label which charset is being used.\n\nIn any case, I'm somewhat opposed to weakening the UTF-8 support requirement to\na SHOULD. It really is a MUST and needs to be stated as such. We can always\nmake exceptions to a MUST on a case by case basis if need be. I doubt very much\nthat there will be that many of them.\n\n> >    In most cases, machines cannot deduce the language of a\n> >    transmitted text by themselves;\n\n> This is not true.

However, you have not\ndemontrated that:\n\n(0) Enough text is always going to be available to make this possible.\n(1) That the 100% point is actually reached. (Convergence to 100% is not\n    the same thing, and in some cases 100% is the only acceptable answer.)\n(2) That the set of languages we use is always closed.\n(3) Machines in the real world will universally be retrofitted to have this\n    capability.\n\n(0), (2), and (3) are in fact demonstrably false. As such, I claim Harald's\nstatement, which you should not didn't say that machine recognitiion isn't\npossible, but only that most machines aren't capable of it right now, is\ncorrect.\n\nMoreover, the point here, that machine recognition of the language being used\ncannot be relied upon, is a damned important one that should not be left out. I\nreally want to forestall finding domain-->language tag tables in some product\nsomewhere. As such, to forestall further argument I suggest that the paragraph\nbe reworded to say that at the present time most machines lack the facilities\nto deduce language from content.\n\n>    Please note that language information as such is not needed\n>    for the end user; humans have no problem identifying the\n>    languages they know and separating them from those they\n>    don't know.\n\nThis point, on the other hand, is demonstrably false since I have a specific\ncounterexample of my own to offer. I routinely deal with customers in over 50\ncountries, quite a few of which either use multiple languages or else don't\nhave domain names that let me deduce country and hence probable language. And I\noccasionally receive messages from these places written in a language other\nthan English, French or Spanish, hence outside my admittedly limited linguistic\nskills and limited dictionary set I keep handy.\n\nAnd moreover, I sometimes cannot figure out what language is being used. (A lot\nof the ones I get look like German to me but aren't. Hey, what can I say, my\neducation in this regard was terrible.) And this actually matters to me, since\ndepending on the language I'll take the message to different people in the\noffice or else forward it to various people I know for translation. A language\ntag would certainly help me in these cases, although I regret to say that such\ntags are rarely used in practice.\n\nThe basic problem here is that you're assuming communication is between people\nwho know each other. This is usually but not always the case, and when it isn't\nthese tags may actually be useful to a human reader.\n\nI therefore do not support the addition of this text, as it will inevitably\nlead to cases where language tags will be omitted when they could have been\nuseful.\n\n>    Please note that languages are not as clearcut a concept as\n>    character sets.

We need these tags and we need\nfor them to be used a lot more than they currently are. What we do not\nneed is to have lots of debates about whether or not a given protocol\nis needs such a field. It is far better to have fields we end up not using\nthan to need fields we do not have.\n\n> >    Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n> >    language of names.\n\n> Do you seriously want to suggest that we devise some kind of\n> language-tag syntax for URLs, Email addresses, host names, and\n> so on?\n\nHere I agree that the present document goes too far.

We want to push UTF-8 as much as possible.\nIf exceptions to a MUST are possible, then there is no contradiction;\nprobably Harald is in the best position to decide this.\n\nWhat I think could become more frequent in the long run are protocols\nor formats that want to go with UCS-2 instead of UTF-8.

But there are other ways to\ninterpret it, namely as a categorical statement, in which case it\nis false.

For examlpe,\ncan somebody tell me whether the word \"burro\" is Italian or Spanish?\nThe meaning changes completely depending on which language you assume.\nTherefore, in human communication, there is usually enough redundancy\nand context, or the incertainty is intended.\nI think that it is important that protocol designers understand\nthat language tags are not something inherently required by the\nfact that humans use various languages, but that they may be\nrequrired by the fact that computers have different (actual or\ntheorectial) capabilities and may lack context. This will help\nprotocol designers to achieve an adequate solution for the\nneeds of their protocols.\n\n\n> Moreover, the point here, that machine recognition of the language being used\n> cannot be relied upon, is a damned important one that should not be left out.\n I\n> really want to forestall finding domain-->language tag tables in some product\n> somewhere.

Your are speaking about\nidentifying languages you don't know, where I explicitly speak about\nlanguages that somebody knows. For the above statement to be true,\nwould need that you are able to distinguish English from Spanish from\nFrench from everything else (lumped together).

But the MLSF debate, among else, has shown that there\nare oppinions in the direction of \"if it's not possible to tag\nevery single character with a language, it can't be called language\ntagging\". For many protocols and applications, this is clearly overkill.\nMy text above was intended to tell protocol designers to seriously\nthink about the interactions between their protocol and language,\nand not to just cover everything with tags in fear the IESG might\notherwise reject their proposal. Maybe you know a different wording\nthat is more precise but has the same desired effect?\n\n\n\n> > >    4.3.

The original sentence seems too obvious because it appears in\nthe context of a whole protocol. Because I haven't yet seen an IETF\nprotocol that uses only iso-2022-jp, it sounded too obvious to me.\nIf it can be reworded so as to be clearly framed as advice\nto implementors (please put a language tag in even if you think\nthe language is obvious from the current charset) and not as\nadvice to protocol designers (don't come to the IESG with a\nprotocol that has no language tags and claim that these can\nbe derived from the charsets), then I'm all for it.\n\n\n\n> > >    In some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n> > >    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n> > >    cases, supplying information in all available languages is a\n> > >    better solution; most sites will either have very few languages\n> > >    installed or be willing to pay the overhead of sending error\n> > >    messages in many languages at once.\n\n> > I don't agree.

On the protocol level, providing only\nfor \"you always get all languages\" is clearly unacceptable for\nthe reasons I have stated. It just doesn't scale, and may hit\nthose that can deal least with it. But what Harald says, as\nfar as I understand it, is on the protocol level, and therefore\nshould be changed.\n\nIf your point is that some customers demand that e.g. messages\nbe sent in multiple languages AT THE SAME TIME, then this is\nan interesting new finding. The ACAP language negotiation\nfacility, for example, wouldn't cover such a case.\nIt may be worth to mention this point at least so that\nprotocol designers can consider it.\nBut again, a protocol that does not have any kind of language\nnegotiation and just sends all available languages all the time\nis not a solution.\n\n\n> > Also, there is an increasing tendency for products to ship\n> > with all language versions integrated.

We cannot force people to implement other languages.\n\nBut it's again a question of framing. What I wanted to say is that\nwe don't want some people to conclude from the implementation\nlevel (only English implementations available) to the protocol\nlevel (therefore, according to the policy, we don't need language\nnegotiation).\nGiven the requirements for interoperability tests to advance\nstandards, we get into a real conflict situation. Probably the\nright solution in such a conflict is to keep the (untested)\nlanguage negotiation facilities in a non-normative appendix,\nbut not to allow them to just die.\n\n\n\n> > Please add something like the following:\n\n> >    6.

It should say \"responsibility of the\nstandard for XXX to assure things *can* be [correctly] labeled\".\nAn implementation can at least try to achieve correctness, while\nthere is not much for a protocol to do about it.\n\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

How about:\n\n        Designation of a certain charset [other than UTF-8???] as a\n        default that does not need to be labeled has turned out\n        to be counter-productive and SHOULD be avoided if ever possible.\n\n\n> >    4.5.

Already currently, and in particular if the text is\nclarified in the sense that I have proposed in an earlier mail,\nthe only thing it says is that the default language must be used\nin those cases where language negotiation was not yet possible.\nSo for example if a HTTP GET request doesn't contain an Accept-Language,\nthe client has forfeited his chance for language negotiation,\nand you can serve whatever you please.\n\nThe only case in HTTP where Default English would come into play\nis the case where the server detects a language header, but the\nheader is malformed and can't be parsed. It would then be\nrequired to respond in English and say something like\n\"Malformed Accept-Language header, can't detect desired language\".\n\nAlso of course in the case of ftp, file contents is not part of\nthe protocol, and can be whatever you want. For gopher, as long\nas negotiation is not possible, this draft doesn't apply anyway.\n\nTogether with the restriction of your point 2) above, I think\nthis is rather reasonable.\n\n\n> 4) History shows us that the dominant language changes over time; English\n> is bound to go the way of Greek and Latin some day.\n\nTrue.

            "content": "I have two comments:\n\n1. POSIX. There is an inherent contradiction between Unicode and POSIX.\nPOSIX as it is today allows one to set one's own preferences for several\nattributes of the characters, while in Unicode they are fixed.\n\nIn the context of a universal character set, I believe the Unicode approach\nis the only one feasible.\n\nOther parts of the locale, where cultural preferences such as date format\nare specified, should, of course, still remain.\n\nA possible solution is for POSIX to specify that for a UCS certain\ncharacter attributes are fixed and are no longer locale dependent.\n\n2. UTF. For some reason I was under the impression that UTF was a temporary\nexpedient, until the communication protocols are comfortable with 16 or 32\nbit characters. The charset policy has it the other way round.\n\nI believe we should be moving faster to just using 16 or 32 bit characters,\nnow that 7 bit communications are no longer dominant.\n\nTo those worried about bandwidth, I will say that most modems today include\ncompression, and your 8 bit characters are in effect compressed down to 4,\n3 and sometimes even 2 bits. 16 or 32 bit characters will not be noticeably\nworse off. Maybe the modem compression schemes could later on be adapted to\n16 or 32 bit characters and become even better. In any case, the various\nUTF schemes are not very impressive as far as compression goes, even for US\nASCII.\n\n\n\n--\n\nJonathan Rosenne\nJR Consulting\nP O Box 33641, Tel Aviv, Israel\nPhone: +972 50 246 522 Fax: +972 9 956 7353\nhttp://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Jonathan_Rosenne/\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n\nReturn-path: <~ned+charsets-errors@sigurd.innosoft.com>\nDisposition-notification-to: John C Klensin <klensin@mci.net>\nReceived: from sigurd.innosoft.com (\"port 4246\"@SIGURD.INNOSOFT.COM)\n by INNOSOFT.COM (PMDF V5.1-10 #8694)\n with ESMTP id <01IN6280DJS694EJB9@INNOSOFT.COM>; Tue, 2 Sep 1997 13:02:18 PDT\nReceived: from THOR.INNOSOFT.COM (SYSTEM@THOR.INNOSOFT.COM [192.160.253.66])\n by sigurd.innosoft.com (PMDF V5.2-0 #15002)\n id <01IN6263ISXS90NSAR@sigurd.innosoft.com>\n (original mail from klensin@mci.net); Tue, 02 Sep 1997 13:01:23 -0700 (PDT)\nReceived: from THOR.INNOSOFT.COM (SYSTEM@THOR.INNOSOFT.COM [192.160.253.66])\n by sigurd.innosoft.com (PMDF V5.2-0 #15002)\n with ESMTP id <01IN5P4I2NTA90NOAO@sigurd.innosoft.com>; Tue,\n 02 Sep 1997 06:47:40 -0700 (PDT)\nReceived: from a4.jck.com (\"port 1476\"@[206.99.215.40])\n by INNOSOFT.COM (PMDF V5.1-10 #8694)\n with ESMTP id <01IN5P41F81Y94EOT2@INNOSOFT.COM>; Tue,\n 02 Sep 1997 06:47:16 -0700 (PDT)\nReceived: from white-box.jck.com (\"port 2074\"@[206.99.215.34])\n by a4.jck.com (PMDF V5.1-8 #25486) with SMTP id <0EFVVMNDO000HQ@a4.jck.com>;\n Tue, 02 Sep 1997 09:47:12 -0400 (EDT)\nDate: Tue, 02 Sep 1997 09:47:10 -0400 (EDT)\nFrom: John C Klensin <klensin@mci.net>\nSubject: Re: UTF-8 revision\nIn-reply-to: <01IN39FRJOLA94E6GE@INNOSOFT.COM>\nTo: Ned Freed <Ned.Freed@INNOSOFT.COM>\nCc: ietf-charsets@INNOSOFT.COM, Francois Yergeau <yergeau@alis.com>\nReply-to: John C Klensin <klensin@mci.net>\nMessage-id: <SIMEON.9709020910.C@muahost.mci.net>\nMIME-version: 1.0\nX-Mailer: Simeon for Windows Version 4.1.2 Build (32)\nContent-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII\nPriority: NORMAL\nX-Authentication: none\n\n\nOn Sun, 31 Aug 1997 12:42:27 -0700 (PDT) Ned Freed\n<Ned.Freed@innosoft.com> wrote:\n>...\n> (2) I think you're going to have a significant problem getting this through\n>     the IETF process unless you take a stand on what happens should the\n>     character assignments in some future Unicode version change in an\n>     incompatible way.

My thinly veiled intent (as it probably took you all of two seconds to\nfigure out) here was to try and keep the IETF from having a change control\nproblem that could only be solved either by tieing the definition of the UTF-8\ncharset to a specific version of 10646/Unicode or else having to vet every\nchange/amendment/whatever that comes along. This is because I think most if not\nall of the additions will be Good Things and also that there will be a lot of\nthem. As such, I attempted to craft an approach that effectively cedes IETF\nchange control over genuine additions but retains it for actual changes to or\nremoval of existing characters.  And frankly, my intent was also to completely\ngloss over the very sticky issue of whether or not the act of deunifying a\nKanji character would count as a change that would have to be explicitly\nblessed by the IETF.\n\nIt simply didn't occur to me that handing over control over additions to the\nUC/UTC folks would be a process issue. But now that you mention it, I of course\nsee that it is. So I would therefore suggest that we tie this to 10646 rather\nthan to Unicode directly. I hope this fixes things to the point where we can\nget this through the process, because it it doesn't, the only alternatives I\nsee are fairly unpalatable.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Well, now that you mention it, I tend to agree that simply registering a\nlabel now would be a lot simpler. On the other hand, we certainly don't want to\nencourage use of Unicode 1.1. But registering names for things is useful even\nwhen we don't want them to be used. And we certainly have registered a lot of\ncharsets in the past -- I've never had a problem with registering so many, only\nwith the fact that the registrations in far too many cases are flawed in some\nway.\n\nAs such, I think the right thing is to go ahead and register the name but to\nstate that use of this character set is strongly discouraged.\n\n> >    I therefore think that\n> >    this specification needs to say that it aligns automatically with\n> >    all future versions of Unicode that don't make incompatible changes, but\n> >    the minute one is made it stays aligned with the old version until and\n> >    unless the IETF specifically decides otherwise.\n\n> I think the new language above addresses that.  How is that?\n\nI think it is excellent. I only hope we can get it through the process. Ceding\nof change control, even to a \"sister\" standards body, even with clearly\ndelineated rules that prevent it from hindering interoperability, can be\na messy thing in the IETF.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

This is an\nengineering requirement to simplify troubleshooting.\n\nI don't like the current wording about the default language being\nEnglish, but different from explicitly negotiating English.  I see two\nacceptable paths:\n\n(1) The default language is \"en\", which may be different from explicitly\nnegotiating an english dialect such as \"en-US\" or \"en-UK\".  New protocols\nMUST provide a mechanism to negotiate a language for human readable text\nwhich would otherwise be sent in the default language.\n\n(2) The default language is \"i-default\".  The difference between\n\"i-default\" and \"en\" is <insert appropriate precise text and registration\nfor i-default here>.\n\nI'm skeptical that we'll find appropriate precise text to insert in the\nhole in section (2) and I don't like the idea of inventing our own\nlanguage (which is what 2 does).\n\nWhat I find unacceptable is having the protocol start up in a state with\npresumably useful error strings, then requiring a one-way negotiation away\nfrom that state.\n\n                - Chris\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Whatever the case may\nbe; No matter how successful you are right now, you can\nprobably profit tremendously from our expertise!\n\nWell, enough talk. Let's get started.....\n\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nDear Internet Friend:\n\nWe know how frustrating it is for most anyone who wants to or tries to,\n\nconduct business online.  You try and try, and just don't seem to get\n\nanywhere. And by anywhere, we mean...Make Money! You see, we've\n\ndiscovered a few secrets that we're going to share with you.\n\n\nRight now there are over fifty million people surfing the Internet.  By\nthe year 2000, that figure is expected to more than double. With so many\npeople using the Internet, smart \"net\"repreneur's are taking advantage\nof what this new (in terms of true commercial application) and exciting\nmedium has to offer.\n\nThe Internet presents one of the best ways to make money that has\never been introduced. On any given day you have the opportunity to\nreach more people than most cities have population wise. This is the\nreason so many businesses are scrambling to make their presence\nknown on the Internet.\n\nBeing \"online\" offers a person the ability to reach multitudes of people\nfrom all over the world.  It also offers, to those who know how, THE\nABILITY TO MAKE EXCELLENT MONEY. And we do mean\nexcellent money!!!\n\nCONSIDER THIS POSSIBILITY: You wake up in the morning and\nyou put on a pot of coffee. As you sip on your cup of hot \"brew\" you\nsaunter over and turn your computer on. Then, as your monitor glows\nfrom dim to bright, you find that you have inquiries from all sorts of\npeople requesting what you have to offer. Later, after you have\nfinished reading your inquiries, you stroll out to your mailbox. You\nfind it is filled with letters from people from all across the world!\nWhat's even better though, is that the letters  are FILLED WITH\nMONEY; cash, checks, and money orders. Then, after tallying\nup the totals, you find that you have made anywhere between\n$200 to $1,000 and it isn't even one o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nThink of it: NO boss, NO traffic, and NO annoying Co-workers.\nWouldn't it feel great to wake up in the morning knowing you\nare going to be making excellent money but don't have to leave\nyour house to do it!?!  Wouldn't your life be far less complicated?\n\nThe truth is, you can be one of those who become financially\nindependent via the Internet. AND THE BEST PART IS...IT\nDOESN'T REQUIRE A LOT OF MONEY!!\n\nWhat it does require is the knowledge of how, what, and where\nto do it. And that is where we can help. We can provide you with\nthe knowledge of how to begin earning substantial income from\nyour computer via the \"information superhighway\".\n\nI can remember how overwhelming the Internet seemed when we\nwere first introduced to it.  We realized the marketing and profit\npotential the Internet holds, but really had no idea how to pursue it.\nIn our thirst for answers and knowledge, we purchased everything\nwe could find that had information on the How, What, and Where.\nWe spent thousands of dollars, but we now know what works and\nwhat doesn't.  No where, in all of our searching, could we find a\ncomplete packet of information for all of our questions.  That is why\nwe decided to write this report.  We have compiled every proven\nmethod and secrets that we have learned along the way into one\ncomplete, easy to understand report.\n\nThe PROVEN REPORT we offer makes believers of skeptics!  This\nis not MLM, nor is it betting or stocks.  It is not a chain letter\nscheme nor a 900 number business.  It's a simple, easy to read, small\nbusiness money making report, that you can easily use for your existing\nprograms or start your first home based business.  The report includes\neverything you need to get started.  A couple of hours per week can\neasily bring you $1000 to $1500 weekly.\n\nDon't think of this as a hype or a scam.  This is opportunity\nknocking...don't pass it by.  Stop wasting your time hoping someone\ncan duplicate your efforts and bring you to financial independence,\nmake your own!! Build your OWN future!\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity, we urge you to take advantage of it.\nYou won't find too many people that will give away ALL of their\nsecrets!!  The majority of the rich people today have copied what\nsomeone else is or has been doing.  That is what we are offering\nyou now--a chance to copy our success!!  It is very easy and we\nARE for REAL!\n\nSound too good to be true?  That's what others have said.  That is,\nuntil they received their reports and saw for themselves just how easy\nit is to make money on the net!\n\n\nHi NI,\n\nI received your report and free bonuses last Saturday and wanted to\ncongratulate you on a job well done. I read through your report \"How\nTo Profit From The Internet\" and I'm very impressed.  I have bought\nother books and manuals about  Online Marketing, Direct Marketing,\nE-mail, Mail Order, etc. Yours is the only one that explains the\nsubject  in an easy to understand language.  I finally found the\nsecrets I've been looking for.\n\nOnce again, Great Job!\n\nSincerely,\nJohn Strand - Satisfied Customer\n\n\n\nMy father has always told me, \"remember, Michele, there is no free\nlunch in life. You get out of life what you put into it.\"  Through trial\nand error and a somewhat slow frustrating start, I purchased your\nreport and finally figured out how to start a very profitable business\nfrom my home.

            "content": "Dear Friend:\n\nNOW, AN EXCITING MLM OPPORTUNITY IS HERE...MUTUAL FUND$ & BABY\nBOOMER$ - A PERFECT MLM MARRIAGE!!!\n\nThe bull market of the past 15 years is still roaring on with stocks\nproving again why they are historically the premier investment choice of\nsavvy investors. Mutual Funds are the vehicles to invest in with\ndiversified investment risk for the underlying individual stocks which\nhave been on a steady climb upward since the early '80s.\n\n                                      FACTS ON MUTUAL FUNDS\n\n- Mutual Funds manage about $2.8 Trillion\n\n- 31% of U.S. households invest in Mutual Funds\n\n- There are over 5,500 different Mutual Funds\n\n                                     BENEFITS OF MUTUAL FUNDS\n\n- LOWER INVESTOR RISK - due to diversification of portfolios by buying\nmany different securities.\n\n- EASY ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY - Mutual Funds mean LIQUIDITY, i.e. you can\nbuy & sell your investment shares on any business day.\n\n- PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT - skilled & experienced investment\nprofessionals invest your money by tracking markets & trends to identify\nopportunities. This allows investors to minimize their monitoring &\nfollow-up.\n\n- NO LOAD/LOW LOAD FEE - Mutual Funds have either no broker's fees or\nvery low fees which are very attractive  especially with frequent\ntransactions.\n\n- BEAUTY OF COMPOUNDING - e.g. a 15% return over 5 years then investors\nget their principal investment back with the beauty of compounding on\nreinvested dividends.\n\n                            TARGET MARKET - BABY BOOMERS\n\nThe most powerful block of consumers are the baby boomers (those born\nbetween 1946-64 with current age range of 33-51). The\nsheer power and financial clout of this group cannot be overstated!\nBoomers are dictating changes in technology, consumer products, style\npreferences, tastes, etc.  All across the spectrum in the U.S. Madison\nAvenue has known this for years and has exploited it in exponential\nfashion. Television advertisers and direct mail catalogue companies\nrecognize the power of this group. Ever notice how the models and actors\nare starting to look a little older, a bit grayer? Ever notice how aging\nrock and roll stars such as Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Tina\nTurner, Bonnie Raitt, etc. are still wildly popular? Why? Because the\ngroup that grew up with these stars has such huge clout in the\nmarketplace - The Baby Boomers!\n\nAging Boomers are the primary target for investments such as Mutual\nFunds because they have the \"need\" for investments as they age and the\n\"discretionary income\" to make these investments. The strong need for\nMutual Funds is driven by other factors as well: the sudden collective\nrealization by this voracious group of consumer products purchasers and\ncredit card users that there \"are\" financial limits (even for them) and\nthat now is the time to exercise financial prudence and discipline. With\nthe long-term viability of Social Security in doubt, retirement concerns\nare starting to mount. This is especially acute with the continual\nincreases in life expectancy for both sexes. College education costs for\ntheir kids are a big concern as well.\n\nThe vast majority of Boomers are computer owners and they are a\nsignificant percentage of online subscribers. They have the need for\nMutual Fund investments, the discretionary income and now the newfound\ndesire to invest in their futures.\n\nThe TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER FOR THIS MLM OPPORTUNITY!!!\nMutual Funds and Baby Boomers are now, and will continue to be, joined\nat the hip right through the Millennium and beyond!\n\n                                   HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?\n\nWe will provide you with four (4) reports that will help the investor\nget ready for his/her Mutual Funds investments by setting financial goals,\ntips to help manage debt, analyze spending habits, patterns (1st Report).\n\nThe second Report will help explain Mutual Funds with emphasis on\nprofessional management, portfolio diversification, etc.\n\nThe third Report will look at investment needs and goals and help lead\nthe investor to the proper investment choice at this stage of his/her\nlife.\n\nFinally, the fourth Report will provide useful tips and information on\nAsset Allocation and determining what mix of funds are best suited\nfor your financial needs and goals.\n\nThese Reports cost $5.00 each. Your total investment is $20.00 with a\nvast market of baby boomers to target. This is a fresh program being\nmarketed on the Internet. It has vast potential because of the size of\nthe target group, the group's \"deep pockets\" plus the investment and\nlong-term security needs of the target group. Your marketing letter can\ncombine the advantages of Mutual Funds as an investment vehicle with the\nbenefits and needs of the target group. The four (4) Reports are\neducational, informative and an excellent first step to a cohesive,\ndisciplined and systematic investment program.\n\n\n\n\n                                               INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSTEP 1- ORDER all four REPORTS listed by Name and Number.  For each\nReport, send $5.00 CASH and a self-addressed stamped envelope to the\nperson listed with the Report. You will need all 4 Reports because you\nwill be Reprinting and Reselling them.  International orders should be sent\nwith $6.00 CASH.  ($1.00 is for the extra postage).\n\nSTEP 2 - Replace the Name & Number under Report number 1 with yours,\nmoving the one that was there down to Report # 2.  Name & Address for #2\nis moved to Report # 3 and name & address of #3 is moved to Report # 4.\nThe # and address of #4 is then dropped from the list.\n\nSTEP 3 - Email a copy of the entire program to Anyone & Everyone.\nYou can get email addresses from companies on the Internet for\nvery reasonable prices.\n\n\n                                                     REPORTS\n\n*****ORDER EACH REPORT BY NUMBER AND NAME*****\n\nALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED ENVELOPE AND\n$5.00 CASH (INTERNATIONAL - $6.00 CASH)  FOR EACH ORDER\nREQUESTING THE SPECIAL REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER\n\nREPORT # 1 - GETTING READY FOR INVESTING\n\n1) Benzer Productions\n    14341 Inglewood Ave., #183\n    Hawthorne, CA 90250\n\nREPORT # 2 - MUTUAL FUNDS - WHAT & WHY\n\n2) Signature\n    369 Montezuma Ave., STE 351\n    Santa Fe, NM 87501\n\nREPORT # 3 - DETERMINING YOUR NEEDS & GOALS\n\n3)  Benzer Productions\n     14341 Inglewood Ave., #183\n     Hawthorne, CA 90250\n\nREPORT # 4 - ASSET ALLOCATION\n\n4)  Signature\n     369 Montezuma Ave., STE 351\n     Santa Fe, NM 87501\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                   CONCLUSION\n\nThis program is brand new. NOW is the time to get in on the ground floor\nof an opportunity that will prove to be financially rewarding beyond\nyour dreams!!!  With MLM gaining more and more acceptance, this\nprogram will have a long run because it makes sense and the product\n(Mutual Funds) and the target group (Baby Boomers) are going to be\naround a long, long time!!!\n\nBEST WISHES WITH THE PROGRAM AND GOOD LUCK!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

My wife Doris and I live in Bel\n-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make prett\ny good money.  When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving\n\"junk mail\"!  I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the popul\nation and percentages involved.  I \"knew\" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally igno\nred my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fu\nn of her, and was ready to lay the old \"I told you so\" on her when the thing di\ndn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over\n 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I wa\ns stunned.  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it\nwouldn't work...I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her \"little\" hobby\n.  I did have seven more years until retirement,  but I think of the \"rat race\"\n and it's not for me...We owe it all to MLM.\n<P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Frank T., Bel-Air, MD\n\n<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        This is the only realistic money-making offer I've\n ever received.  I participated because this plan truly makes sense. I was surp\nrised when the $5.00 bills started filling my mail box. By the time it tapered\noff I had received over 8,000 orders with over $40,000 in cash.  Dozens of peop\nle have sent warm personal notes too, sharing the news of their good fortunes!\n It's been WONDERFUL.\n<P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Carl Winslow Tulsa, O\nK\n\n<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        The main reason for this letter is to convince you\n that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get\na large amount of money in a short time.  I was approached several times before\n I checked this out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for\nthe minimal effort and money required.  Initially I let no one in the organizat\nion know that I was an attorney and, to my astonishment, I received $36,470.00\nin the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.\n<P ALIGN=LEFT>                                Sincerely yours, Phillip A.

I hope I have sparked your own exci\ntement, if you follow the program exactly, you could have the same success I ha\nve, if not better.  Your success is right around the corner, but you must do a\nlittle work.\n<P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Good Luck!  G. Bank\n\n<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        Not being the gambling type, it took me several we\neks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am\n I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way\n that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy I was su\nrprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders.  After\n that it got so over-loaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the windo\nw.  I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before.  The ni\nce thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people\n live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.\n<P ALIGN=LEFT>                                Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI\n\n<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        This is my third time to participate in this plan.\n  We have quit our jobs, and quite soon we will buy a home on the beach and liv\ne off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will wor\nk for you is if you do it.  For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pas\ns up this golden opportunity.  Remember, when you order your four reports, SEND\n CASH.  Checks have to clear the bank and create too many delays.  Good luck an\nd happy spending!\n<P ALIGN=LEFT>                                        Charles Fairchild, Sp\nokane, WA\n\n<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>        Typically when I look at a money-making deal I wan\nt to know if the company is strong, will it be here when it's time for my big p\nay off.  In this crazy thing there is no company intervention for management to\n blow it.  Just people like me ordering directly from the source!  Interesting.\n..I had a couple of projects I'd been trying to fund to no avail so I thought;\nWhy not give it a try?  Well 2 1/2 weeks later the orders started coming in.

            "content": "The Piranha Program\n\n\nWe are prepared to out-service, out-promote, out-position, out-strategize and\nunder-cut any other company in our industry to assure our mutual financial\nsuccess Read this letter and discover an opportunity that is nothing short\nof miraculous.\n\nDear Opportunist,\n\n Business opportunity experts identify the Occupational Health Screening Indust\nry as a solid, emerging, and high-\ngrowth business opportunity.   With our program structure, your financial gain\nwill multiply ten fold.\n\n\n7 Sure Reasons Why This Life-Time Wealth Building Opportunity Will Not Fail\n\n1.      YOU will have the most competitive pricing structure in the industry, d\nue to our high volume and low over-head.\n2.      YOU will be a part of the only company in the industry that will custom\nize service sites for any client.\n3.      YOU will provide more products and services in our service centers, whi\nch provides substantially more client satisfaction.\n4.      YOU will be motivated with high commissions that are residual income.\n5.      YOU will be provided expert training; materials and quality business le\nads.\n6.      This program is like no other.  It focuses on an industry that has an o\npen opportunity, with a 16 % annual growth rate, giving\nYOU added advantage.\n7.      YOUR SUCCESS IS OUR SUCCESS.  We are a highly motivated corporation dri\nven to near obsession to achieve\nindustry domination.\n\n     The primary reason we can assure your success in finalizing agreements is\nbecause we are a Wholesaler of screening\nproducts and services.  This means, you'll be able to undercut any screening pr\nice in your area, and still receive a generous\ncommission.\n\n     For example; say the average drug screening price in your area is $50.00 d\nollars per test including collection, we offer to our\nindependent representative a Drug Screen at a total price of $35.00 dollars and\n you can sell the test for $47.00 dollars.  This\ngives YOU a commission of $12.00 dollars per drug screening test.  If you sign\na client who performs 1,000 test per year, that\none contract will yield you a $12,000 dollars commission every year for the lif\ne of the contract.\n\n     All you did was have an employer sign a simple service agreement, which ac\ntually saved him money, time and a major\nliability issue.\n\n     Now, let's say that same employer refers you to a friend who needs our ser\nvices, or better yet, that same employer has\nmultiple work sites throughout the country.  You would be able to sign a servic\ne agreement with that same employer to services\nall his sites anywhere in the Unites States.\n\n Why?\n\n     G.S.T., through its sister division, can develop a servicing site nearly a\nnywhere in the United States.  You may not realize it\nnow, but this gives you an unbelievable advantage over any other competitor in\nthe nation.\n\n     Not only can you give a client the best price; you can provide customized\nservice almost anywhere in the\ncountry.  These are just two important areas, as we stated earlier, where this\nindustry is lacking.  This allows our joint efforts an\neven greater opportunity.  You will be the only one able to deliver both of the\nse advantages.\n\n     Our representative will also enjoy another advantage; the ability to provi\nde quality service on demand.  If the same employer\nprevious mentioned conducts another 2,000 tests nationwide, you will earn anoth\ner $24,000 dollars in commission with a\ntotal of $36,000 dollars in annual commission for this one account.  Not a bad\nday's work!\n\n     This is very realistic for many of you, but what about the thousands of ot\nher employers that have one hundred or less\nemployees who need our services? DON'T FORGET ABOUT THEM!  These other accounts\n add up to a big income quickly\nand they are right in your own backyard.  In addition, we will show you easy me\nthods to produce instant leads of potential new\nclients.\n\n     You'll be capable of giving employers fresh ideas on their screening progr\nams with our common sense techniques.  The low\nprices alone will close the deal. What could be better than that!  Our plan ben\nefits both you and our corporation with low\noverhead, supplying employers with cut throat prices, while you walk away with\nlucrative commissions.\n\n     And that's just the beginning. We refer to you, as an opportunist because\nthat's the first ingredient required making any\nbusiness venture a success.  The second, is the perfect opportunity delivered a\nt the right time.  These brought together by a\nmotivated results driven corporation, with high quality products in a low quali\nty product industry, spells easy success for our\ncombined efforts.\n\nIf you really take the time to read and understand everything in this detailed\ninformation packet, you will have full knowledge of\nwhy this business program is considered by most to be the biggest and easiest w\nealth building opportunity of its time.  This is\nwhy everyone else in our industry has alarm for concern.\n\n     And there's a reason for that.\n\n     We make our living in a $7 billion dollar plus industry, which has a 16 %\nannual growth rate. Our products and\nservices, in many instances, are mandated by law and affect the security of bus\niness, industry and all of our country's citizens.\nOur industry has now moved into its secondary growth phase by servicing small b\nusiness, schools and homes.  This provides an\nincredible marketing opportunity everywhere you look.\n\n     If you take our high quality wholesale priced products and services and co\nmpare them with the industries high priced, low\nquality products and services, it becomes child's play in reality to achieve an\ny level of financial success you choose.  Now that\nyou have some general information, let's take out the microscope and examine th\ne details.\n\n     The name of our company is Global Screening Technologies (G.S.T.), we are\na division of Global Resource Management\nGroup, Inc. (G.R.M.G.).  We are in the business of selling health and occupatio\nnal screening products and services, as well as,\nbackground investigative services, (employee education, driving, criminal and w\norkers' compensation history).  By the\ndescription, you can see our products and services are unique to any other weal\nth building opportunity existing in the market\nplace today.   It has been solely created to fulfill a very large market need.\n\n     The health and occupational screening industry concerns itself with provid\ning employers and many others with\nDrug and Alcohol Testing, as well as, required physical examinations and backgr\nound history.  For business and\nindustry, it is a necessity when hiring and maintaining a viable workforce.\n\n     Our services help to screen employees for drug and alcohol abuse and the a\nbility to perform on the job.  If an employer\ndoes not perform these testing procedures, they make themselves vulnerable to s\nafety violations, and potential litigation.  This\ncan be extremely devastating to the business.  It is also very prudent for an e\nmployer to screen all new employees to prevent the\nhiring of someone considered a high risk to the business image, safety, moral a\nnd productivity.\n\n     We provide American business and industry an opportunity to have the highe\nst quality screening programs to\nachieve their goals.  In addition, it is logical for business and industry to r\neduce liability exposure.\n\n     Let me explain.\n\n     Major corporations are already implementing drug and alcohol pre-employmen\nt,       (post-offer conditional), screening\nprocedures.  It's success, has allowed for the permanent implementation of thes\ne screening procedures.  As previously stated,\nthe health and occupational screening industry is growing at an estimated 16 %\nannually.  That's phenomenal!\n\n     Drug and Alcohol Testing is spreading to schools and is expected to contin\nue to have strong growth until all\nschools are performing such procedures.\n\n     Internally, This is how America is fighting the drug problem of our societ\ny; And, It's working.\n\n     Global Screening Technologies will work with YOU to reap a wealth of finan\ncial benefits.

One way in\nwhich we can accomplish this; through our business opportunity program providin\ng us with an enormous army of marketing\nrepresentatives whom will let others know about the obvious advantages of our p\nricing structure and preferred servicing sites.\n\n     Our wholesale pricing is set in most states, allowing G.S.T. to pass on la\nrge commissions to our nationwide\nindependent sales representatives.

You'll never guess how much money\nthey want.  Now hold on to your seat.  They will do all of this for only $14,00\n0 dollars.\n\n     We don't know about you, but that sounds a little steep.  We would not mor\ntgage the farm if we were you!  That means you\nwould have to go out and get the business, service it, and manage all the compl\nicated paperwork.  The truth is, you would either\nstarve to death, or die from exhaustion.  You'll make more money representing u\ns, as we provide superior products and\nservices, and have time to spend your commission checks.  We have yet to see th\ne benefit of this other program.\n\n     G.S.T. has invested an incomprehensible amount of our time and money to de\nvelop this business and marketing opportunity.\nWe offer this proven program for a one-time fee of $89.00 dollars. This cost to\n you covers our expense of printing the\nmaterials and our teleconferencing time to train our independent representative\ns. If you have ever signed up with a multi-level\nmarketing company you will easily pay double our fee.\n\n     Please, don't confuse our program with MLM.  This is strictly a business o\npportunity that has a symbiotic benefit.  Simply, if\nyou don't sell, we don't service, and neither of us will profit, It's that simp\nle.\n\nThe Secret to Genuine Success in the Occupational Health Screening Industry\n\n     All our program materials take you step by step through a specific trainin\ng regiment, utilizing audiocassettes and books.

This program has been\ndemonstrated to be infallible, and is known to no others in this industry.\n\nOur methods are infallible\n\n     Because of our corporations' unique abilities and expertise, we believe th\nat everyone who wants to grow financially must\nhave a precise plan with easy to follow steps.  Not to mention, having the righ\nt products to offer, at the right time, with the right\nsupport.

The minute you use something like charset-edition to distinguish\nbetween two versions of Unicode with different code points it becomes part of\nwhat's necessary to determine the right octet to character mapping, since\nwithout it a given octet could map to two or more characters. Having to change\na core piece of MIME like this would necessarily require a reset to proposed.\n\n> Now a \"charset-subset\" parameter would be quite useful down the road as\n> characters are added.

We believe that there should be little\nor NO restrictions on Internet communications and email!\nOur two (2) software programs demonstrate the notion of\nunlimited, uncensored, and unrestricted, bullet-proof\nemail use.\n\n  YOU'LL RECEIVE 2 HIGH-SPEED EMAIL SOFTWARE PROGRAMS\n\nIntroducing....\"FLOODGATE BULK EMAIL LOADER\"\n        AND....\"GOLDRUSH STEALTH MASS MAILER\"\n\nI operate a custom email service. From my experience, your typical bulk email s\nervice just collects email addresses from any source they can rely on shear vol\nume emailing to produce the desired results - the \"shotgun\" approach. I have fo\nund that by targeting emails to groups that would likely be specifically intere\nsted in your product, the response rate is much better than when using the \"sho\ntgun\" approach AND you don't tend to annoy as many people (which is nice for bo\nth sides). By targeting emails, I mean that I collect the addresses myself from\n on-line areas (forums, newsgroups, etc.) so that I mail to people that are lik\nely to be interested in my products based on their on-line participation.\n\nFLOODGATE is the renegade technology that helps me do this.\n\nThis is the same software that all bulk emailing services use!\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nFloodgate Bulk Email Loader Version 5.2 AND\nGoldrush Stealth Mass Mailer Version 2.018\nfor Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 now Supports 17\n(really more with the free form filter) File Formats\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSEND OUT 20,000+ MARKETING LETTERS EVERY SINGLE DAY!\n\nOr...every few days. In fact, when I send out just a few thousand marketing let\nters each day, it doesn't take long before I'm completely swamped with email in\nquiries and phone calls. This is very easy to do. And each one of these bulk ma\nilings costs me nothing. I can teach you how to do this and provide you with th\ne tools you'll need.\n\nIf you've got a good marketing letter, I'll show you how to open the floodgates\n. You'll be deluged with inquiries, leads, and real sales, using nothing but em\nail alone.\n\nWriting a good marketing letter is not easy. I often have to rewrite my marketi\nng letters a half dozen times before I get the results I'm looking for. But onc\ne you have a good letter, as you probably know, you can use the same letter ove\nr and over again, predictably and consistently, closing sales, week after week,\n month after month.\n\nIt takes me about one hour to send my marketing letter to THOUSANDS of fresh em\nail addresses. I can do this, thanks to a Windows program I use. It's called Fl\noodgate and Goldrush Stealth Mass Mailer. It's a bulk email loader and an email\n software program. If you're interested in electronic marketing, you should kno\nw about these programs.\n\nPROGRAM #1: FLOODGATE FOR WINDOWS\n\nThe Floodgate Bulk Email Loader imports simple text files that anyone can downl\noad from CompuServe, Prodigy, Delphi Genie, or the Internet. These text files c\nontain classified ads, forum messages, or data from the member directory. Each\nof these files is filled with email addresses.\n\nFloodgate is designed to read these files and strip out the email addresses. It\n then sorts the addresses, removes any duplicates, and formats them into an out\nput file, with 10, 20 or 30 addresses per line. This is all done in one simple\nstep. Just point and click.\n\nYou'll need either a Windows based Internet account or an America On-line accou\nnt to send out your marketing letters. Neither AOL nor the Internet charges to\nsend email. Send your letter to 1,000 people or 10,000 people -- the cost is al\nways the same. NOTHING!\n\nNEW! PREPARE A MAILING OF 50,000+\nIN LESS THAN A 1/2 HOUR\n\nIf you open an Internet account, you can send each letter to 20,000+ people. Th\ne new Floodgate now directly writes distribution lists. Some people are always\ncollecting new addresses, but if you publish a newsletter or adsheet, you'll be\n using the same addresses over and over again. That's real power! When using ad\ndresses you've previously collected, you can press a few buttons and prepare a\nmailing of 50,000+ in less than a half hour.\n\n(To get a list of all the Internet access providers in your local calling area\ngoto: http://thelist.com and click on your area code.)\n\nThe Floodgate Users Guide will teach you, step by step, how to download the rig\nht files, how to strip the addresses, and finally, how to cut and paste the for\nmatted addresses into your marketing letter. Or, if you have an Internet accoun\nt, how to create distribution lists. One you've done this a few times you won't\n even have to think. It's that simple!\n\nFOR THE BRAVE & DARING: PUSHING TECHNOLOGY TO ITS LIMITS\n\nAs you may know, the practice of sending unsolicited email is usually frowned u\npon, and most service providers have rules against it. But, like jay-walking, t\nhere is little enforcement. It's not illegal. If someone tells you that it is,\nask them to provide the citation (and don't let them give you some nonsense abo\nut faxes - that's not email). They can't do it because it's not there. Sometime\ns, when a lot of people complain, I get a warning letter. And that's about it.\n\nAbout 1 in 200 will write back and tell me, \"take me off the list\", which I can\n do, thanks to Floodgates Remove List feature. Many people reply back thanking\nme for sending them my informative letter. That's always nice. Most people thou\ngh, just reply and say, \"send me more info.\" In this way, it usually takes me t\nwo or three letters to close a sale.\n\nThe Floodgate Users Guide will provide you with proven formats for writing a su\nccessful marketing letter. You'll test and rewrite, test and rewrite. Then, onc\ne you've got it, just push a few buttons, and open the floodgates!!!\n\nTHE FLOODGATE BULK EMAIL LOADER CURRENTLY SUPPORTS 17+ FILE FORMATS\n\n1. CompuServe Classifieds: Send your marketing letter to everyone who is runnin\ng a classified ad. I'll teach you how to download all the classifieds from any\nsingle ad category. This is one of the most responsive list of buyers. They che\nck their email every day and they're already in business.\n\n2. America On-line Classifieds: Download 1,000 addresses in 15 minutes. These a\nre excellent lists for business to business sales.\n\n3. CompuServe Forums: You can join a forum and download hundreds of forum messa\nges in a matter of minutes.\n\n4. America On-line Forums: Choose from dozens of forums. All good targeted list\ns.\n\n5. Prodigy Forums: Prodigy allows you to easily export any group of forum messa\nges. More targeted lists.\n\n6. Internet Newsgroups: These are all targeted lists. You'll be able to send yo\nur marketing letter to everyone who posts a message in any newsgroup. Easily co\nllect 1,000's of addresses per hour.\n\n7. America On-line Member Directory: Most member directories only allow you to\nsearch by city and state. With AOL, you can search by business type, hobbies, c\nomputer type, etc. This is the gem of all\nmember directories. Build huge targeted lists.\n\n8. CompuServe Member Directory: This is a major resource. If you're willing to\ntarget your mailing to a single city, you can collect about 1,000 email address\nes an hour.\n\n9. Delphi Member Directory: The Delphi member directory allows you to search fo\nr people based on key words. These are good targeted mailing lists. A single se\narch can easily generate 5,000 addresses.\n\n10. Genie Member Directory: Similar to the CompuServe member directory, only yo\nu can download names much quicker. You can easily pull hundreds of thousands of\n addresses out of each of these member directories.\n\n11. CompuServe File Cabinet: If you run classified ads, and save the responses\nin the CIM file cabinet, you'll be able to easily reuse these addresses. You ca\nn send your marketing letter to everyone in any single folder. Build master lis\nts and clean UP your hard drive.\n\n12. Free Form: If you have a text file with email addresses that floodgate does\n not support, chances are the Free Form filter will be just what you need. Just\n enter a key word to search for.\n\n13. CompuServe Form Profiles (Forum Membership Directories): Easy to build targ\neted lists here. Each search can easily bring you 500+\naddresses.\n\n14. Genie Profiles: If you're building targeted lists, you'll get a lot of addr\nesses very quickly from Genie.\n\n15. Plain Addresses: Read Floodgate Master Files back into Floodgate to merge f\niles and do selective mailings. Also useful for the management of email address\n lists that you might purchase.\n\nFloodgate also has filters to allow you to include or exclude any groups of add\nresses in your final distribution lists. For example, you could include only em\nail addresses that ended in .com or exclude all with .gov. You could exclude al\nl noc, root, and other addresses that almost guarantee a negative response. The\nse filters are fully configurable and can be used together.\n\nBUILD REUSABLE MASTER FILES\n\nFloodgate maintains Master Files for each of your marketing letters. If you dow\nnload from the same place on a regular basis, you only want to send your letter\n to the new people. Floodgate will compare the new addresses with those in the\nMaster File, and prepare a mailing list of only new people. The new addresses a\nre, of course, then added to the Master File. With each new mailing your Master\n File grows and grows.\n\nYou may create as many Master Lists as you need. When you start a new marketing\n campaign, you'll want to send your new letter to everyone on your Master List.\n If you write a newsletter, each time you send your newsletter, you'll send it\nto everyone on a Master List.\n\nTHE REMOVE LIST\n\nVery often, people will reply and tell you to take them off your mailing list.\nPlace these addresses in the REMOVE.MST file and they will never receive anothe\nr letter from you again. In this way, you will be operating your business with\nthe most professionalism\npossible.\n\nDON'T BE FOOLED\n\nWe have some new competitors that have tried to copy Floodgate. The following l\nist describes why Floodgate is BETTER.......\n\n**Floodgate is a mature, bug free product. Not an initial release.\n**Floodgate comes with over 100 pages of step by step       documentation.\n**Floodgate is the only one offering a money back     guarantee.\n**Floodgate has more testimonials.\n**Filter for filter, Floodgate offers more capabilities,   way more.\n**Floodgate does everything all the others *combined* claim.\n**Floodgate is by far the easiest to use.\n**There is NO *cutting and pasting* with Floodgate.\n**We have by far, the BEST technical support.\n\nSOME QUICK MATH\n\nFloodgate can pay for itself in a few days. It can also cut your advertising co\nsts down to almost nothing. Think of what the competition will do when they get\n their Floodgate program. Don't be left in the dust - there are 75 million peop\nle out there, just a few keystrokes away. Let's do the math:\n\n- Email 50,000 sales letters (takes about 1-2 hours)\n- Let's say your product will bring you $5 profit per   sale.\n- Let's also say you only get a 1% response   (occasionally higher).\n\n* That's 500 orders x $5 = $2,500 profit !! Now imagine what 500,000 letters wo\nuld do for your business !!\n\nWHAT CAN I MARKET ON-LINE?\n\nYou can market anything on-line using direct email, that can be marketed using\nconventional postal direct mail marketing. The possibilities are practically en\ndless. If it sells off-line, you can sell it on-line.\n\nEASY TO INSTALL AND EASY TO LEARN\n\nThe Floodgate Email Loader requires Windows. The SUPPLIED MANUAL tells you wher\ne to go, what to do, and how to do it. All you need are basic computer skills t\nhat can be learned with a little practice or help from our computer savvy techn\nicians.\n\nPROGRAM #2: GOLDRUSH STEALTH MASS MAILER\n\nDo not get this program confused with other slow speed programs that call thems\nelves \"STEALTH\".

Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for\n the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated. After unprodu\nctive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I\nincurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends, and cre\nditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just co\nuldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to\n support my family and struggling business. I truly believe it was wrong for me\n to be in debt like this. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my l\nife and I am writing to share my experience in hopes that this will change your\n life FOREVER....FINANCIALLY.\n\nIn mid-December, I received this program via email. Six months prior to receivi\nng this program I had been sending away for information on various business opp\nortunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost effect\nive. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investm\nent was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not. One claimed I'd m\nake a million in one year...it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make\nit.\n\nInitially I sent out 100,000 emails. It only cost me about $80.00 for my hiring\n of a bulk -mail company. The great thing about e-mail is that I didn't need an\ny money for printing to send out the program, only the cost to fulfill my order\ns. I am telling you like it is, I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised\nmyself that I would not \"cheat\" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me.\n\nIn less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. By Janua\nry 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. When you read the GUARANTEE in\n the program, you will see that \"YOU MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1\n WITHIN TWO WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!\" My first\nstep in making $50,000 in 90 to 120 days was done. By January 30th, I had recei\nved 196 orders for REPORT #2. If you go back to the GUARANTEE, \"YOU MUST RECEIV\nE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN TWO WEEKS. IF NOT SEND OUT MORE PROGR\nMAS UNTIL YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $50,\n000 GOAL.\" Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sa\nt back and relaxed. By March 19th, of my emailing of 100,000, I received $58,00\n0 with more coming in every day.\n\nI paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take the time\nto read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER! Remember, it wo\nn't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EX\nACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different pla\nce. It doesn't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! REPORT #2 explains this\n. Always follow the guarantee, 15 to 20 orders for REPORT #1, and 100 or more o\nrders for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 to 120 days. I AM L\nIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS !!!\n\nIf you chooses not to participate in this program, I'm sorry. It really is a gr\neat opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate,\nfollow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. If you ar\ne a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like I was, or you w\nant to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID!\n\n                        Sincerely,\n                        Christopher Erickson\n\nPS  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a\n kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!\n\n\"THREW IT AWAY\"\n\n\"I had received this program before. I threw it away, but later wondered if I s\nhouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get a\ncopy, so I had to wait until I was mailed another copy of the program. Eleven m\nonths passed, then it came. I DIDN'T throw this one away. I made $41,000 on the\n first try.\"\n\n                        Dawn W., Evansville, IN\n\n\"THINK ABOUT IT\"\n\nBefore you delete this program form your mailbox, as I almost did, take a littl\ne time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what c\nould happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no\n matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! Definitely ge\nt back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first order\ns come in. IT WORKS!\n\n                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC\n\nHERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$\n\nLet's say that you decided to start small, jut to see how it goes, and we'll as\nsume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume\n that the mailing receives a .5% response. Using a good list the response could\n be much better. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of progra\nms instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000\nprograms. With a 5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 pe\nople respond by sending our 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of t\nhose .5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 people mail out 2,0\n00 programs each for a total of 200,000. The .5% response to that is 1,000 orde\nr for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total\n. The .5% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4. That's 10,000 five d\nollar bills for you. CASH!!! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 +\n$5,000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO\n ABSOLUTELY NOTHING...AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT W\nOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000\n. Believe me, many people will do that and more! By the way, your cost to parti\ncipate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have a Internet co\nnnection and e-mail is FREE!! REPORT #3 will show you the best methods for bulk\n e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.\n\nINTRODUCTIONS\n\nThis is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:\n\nStep (1)  Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER. Do this by orderi\nng the REPORT from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page. For each R\nEPORT, send $5 CASH and a SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope (BUSINESS SIZE #10)\nto the person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT. International orders should also\ninclude $1 extra for postage. It is essential that you specify the NAME and NUM\nBER of the report requested to the person you are ordering from. You will need\nALL FOUR REPORTS because you will be PRINING and RESELLING them. DO NOT alter t\nhe names or sequence other than what the instructions say. IMPORTANT:  Always p\nrovide same-day service on all orders.\n\n\nStep (2)  Replace the name and address under REPORT #1 with yours, moving the o\nne that was there down to REPORT #2. Drop the name and address under REPORT #2\nto REPORT #3, moving the one that was there to REPORT #4. The name and address\nthat was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on\n the way to the bank. When doing this, make certain you type the names and addr\nesses ACCURATELY! DO NOT NIX UP MOVING PRODUCT/REPORT POSITIONS!!!\n\nStep (3)  Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it as a text\n(.txt) file in it's own directory to be used with whatever email program you li\nke. Again, REPORT #3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquir\ning email lists.\n\nStep (4)  Email a copy of the entire program (all of this is very important) to\n everyone whose address you can get your hands on. Start with friends and famil\ny since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making\nopportunity. That's what I did. And they love me now, more than ever. Then, ema\nil to anyone and everyone! Use your imagination! You can get email addresses fr\nom companies on the Internet who specialize in email mailing lists. These are v\nery cheap, 100,000 addresses for around $80.00, and they will do the mailing fo\nr you! One of the reports will tell you where to get this deal from.\n\nIMPORTANT:      You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so always\n request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase these lists whe\nn you order the four 4 REPORTS.\n\nALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DSY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!\n\nREQUIRED REPORTS\n\n***Order each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***\n\nALWAYS SEND A SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED EMVELOPE\nAND $5 CASH FOR EACH ORDER REQUESTING THE\nSPECIFIC REPORT BY NAME AND NUMBER\n\n\n\n\nREPORT #1\n\"HOW TO MAKE $250,000 THROUGH MULIT-LEVEL SALES\"\n\nORDER REPORT #1 FROM:\nAVM\nP.O.

You too, will\n be making money in 90 - 120 days, if you follow the SIMPLE STEPS outlined in t\nhis mailing.\nHowever, very few people reach financial independence, because when opportunity\n knocks, they choose to ignore it. It is much easier to say \"NO\" than \"YES\", an\nd this is the question that you must answer. Will YOU ignore this amazing oppor\ntunity or will you take advantage of it? If you do nothing, you have indeed mis\nsed something and nothing will change. Please re-read this material, this is a\nspecial opportunity. If you have any questions, please feel free to write to th\ne send of this information. You will get a prompt and informative reply.\n\nMy method is simple. I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that cost me p\nennies to produce and email. I should also point out that this program is legal\n and everyone who participates WILL make money. This is not a chain letter or a\n pyramid scheme. At times you have probably received chain letters, asking you\nto send money, on faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever\n. Not only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the chai\nn makes them quite unattractive.\n\nYou are offering a legitimate product to your people. After they purchase the p\nroduct from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free enterpri\nse. As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is a series of four\n4 FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS. The information contained in the REPORTS will\n not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding,\n but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the year\ns ahead. You are also buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which wi\nll be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program. The concise one\nand two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local cop\ny center for about 3 cents a copy. Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!\n\n\nTIPS FOR SUCCESS\n\nSend for your four 4 REPORTS immediately so you will have them when the orders\nstart coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST  send out the product/se\nrvice to comply with US Postal and Lottery Laws. Title 18 Sections 1302 and 134\n1 specifically state that: \"A PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RE\nCEIVED.\"\n\nWHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPROTS TO ARRIVE:\n\n1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you desire.\n\n2.      Get a post office box (preferred).\n\n3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must remember, your na\nme and address go next to REPORT #1 and the others all move down one, with the\nfourth one being bumped OFF the list.\n\n4.      Obtain as many email addresses as possible to send until you receive th\ne information on mailing list companies in REPORT #3.\n\n5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out . The more you\nsend, and the quicker you send  them, the more money you will make.\n\n6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.\n\n7.      Copy the four 4 REPORTS so you are able to send them out as soon as you\n receive an order. IMPORTANT:  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RE\nCEIVE.\n\n8.  Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.\n\n\nYOUR GUARANTEE\n\nThe check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this: you must receive\n15 10 20 orders for REPORT #1. This is a must! If you don't within two weeks, e\nmail out more programs until you do. Then a couple of weeks later you should re\nceive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2, if you don't, send out more programs u\nntil you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, (take a d\neep breath) you can sit back and relax, because YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE AT LEAST\n$50,000. Mathematically it is a proven guarantee. Of those who have participate\nd in this program and reached the above GUARANTEES - All have reached their $50\n,000 goal. Also, remember, every time your name is moved down the list you are\nin form of a different REPOPT, so you can keep track of your program by knowing\n what people are ordering from you. IT'S THAT EASY, REALLY, IT IS!!!\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

            "content": "On Mon, 1 Sep 1997, Chris Weider wrote:\n\n> I think Ned is completely correct here. The workshop report thought long\n> and hard about requiring language tagging and mandatory UTF-8 and\n> realized that this is the only way to make things work with the stupid\n> machines we have now :^)\n\nChris - In general, I very much agree. Pushing UTF-8, and strongly\ntelling people to include language tagging into their protocols, is\nvery much what is needed. I definitely do not want to argue about\nthis.\n\nHowever, both for UTF-8 and for language tags, as well as for\nother internationalization issues, I think it is important to\nnot preclude further developments, and not to express requirements\nin an absolute and unchangeable way that makes protocol developers\nand implementers think that if only the do X, all their internatio-\nnalization problems go away.\n\nSpecifically, I agree that UTF-8 in most cases is the best\nsolution, especially in text-based protocols which are the\nmajority of the current application area protocols. But there\nare also binary protocols (the Internet printing protocol\ncurrently under discussion is a recent examlpe), and for\nsuch protocols, there may be situations where 16-bit alignement\nis necessary in general and so using UTF-16 is a neat choice.\nIn general, machines have moved from 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit\nto 64-bit architectures, and byte sizes have moved from\n5 to 6 to 7 to 8 (with some cases of 9) bits. It may well be\nthat it future, we see hardware that works with 128-bit words,\nbut which has to use shift-and-mask techniques for 8-bit bytes,\nbecause the smallest size it supports directly is 16-bit bytes.\nNot that I think that these things will appear very soon in\ngreat numbers, but in ten years, they could very well be around.\nIf we can word our policy so that it doesn't read ridiculously\nshortsighted if and when this happens, that would not be a bad\nthing, and wouldn't hurt at all.\n\nSpecifically, I also agree that language tags are a big help\nto current stupid machines. But if we put an absolute requirement\nfor language tags into our policy, a requirement that in the\nextreme might say: \"Every protocol has to be able to language\ntag all the characters it sends around, with potentially\ndifferent tags for each character.\", and we thereby give\nimplementors the impression that that's all they have to do,\nand text-to-speech conversion, machine-translation, spelling\nand grammar checks, hyphenation, high-quality display, and\nsubtile glyph distinctions maybe necessary for names, and so on,\nwill work magically and perfectly, then we clearly create the\nwrong impression.\n\nNed Freed gave a very good examlpe in his mail about a case\nwhere langage information can be very helpful, namely the\ncase where somebody receives email from a user and is not\nable to find out what language it is written in and therefore\nwhom he should forward it for further processing.\nBut for this case, automatic language detection seems to\nbe extremely well suited. The idea has been around for years,\nbut it is interesting to see that in the last few months and\nweeks (in particular at the recent Unicode conference in San\nJose), I have heard from at least four companies that are\nseriously working on this issue, with good results, and\nwith some of the adding new languages almost each week.\nIn particular, Microsoft is doing such work, and Alis\nTechnologies gave a floppy disk with a test program to\nselected users/clients. I guess that Ned could greatly\nbenefit e.g. from the Alis program; I would be glad to\norganize the contact. Please note that this was on a\nfloppy disk, covering something between 20 and 50 languages,\nso it's something that may well be a standard PC OS\ncomponent in a few years.\n\nAgain, let me make it very clear that I am not at all against\nUTF-8 or language tagging; I guess I have enough of a track\nrecord to make that clear (for UTF-8, have a look e.g. at\nthe archives of the FTPEXT WG, for language tagging, see\nRFC 2070). But I think it is crucial that we word the policy\nin such a way that it lets protocol developpers take their\nown requirements into account, and take care of the specific\ninternationalization needs, and not just follow a few words\nblindly.\n\n\nRegrads,        Martin.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Introduction\n\n    The Internet is international.\n\n    With the international Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n    interchange data in a multiplicity of languages, which in turn\n    utilize a bewildering number of characters.\n\n    This document is (INTENDED TO BE) the current policies being\n    applied by the Internet Engineering Steering Group towards the\n    standardization efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force in\n    order to help Internet protocols fulfil these requirements.\n\n    The document is very much based upon the recommendations of the\n    IAB Character Set Workshop of February 29-March 1, 1996, which is\n    documented in RFC 2130 [WR]. This document attempts to be concise,\n    explicit and clear; people wanting more background are encouraged\n    to read RFC 2130.\n\n    The document uses the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\" and \"MAY\", and their\n    negatives, in the way described in [RFC 2119]. In this case, \"the\n    specification\" as used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing of\n    protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.\n\n\n    2.  Where to do internationalization\n\n    Internationalization is for humans. This means that protocols are\n    not subject to internationalization; text strings are. Where\n    protocol elements look like text tokens, such as in many IETF\n    application layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts\n    are protocol and which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n\n    Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many\n    of them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak\n    out of the local context at times. RFC 1958 [ARCH] recommends US-\n    ASCII for all globally visible names.\n\n    This document does not mandate a policy on name\n    internationalization, but requires that all protocols describe\n    whether names are internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\n    NOTE: In the protocol stack for any given application, there is\n    usually one or a few layers that need to address these problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 2]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    It would, for instance, not be appropriate to define language tags\n    for Ethernet frames. But it is the responsibility of the WGs to\n    ensure that whenever responsibility for internationalization is\n    left to \"another layer\", those responsible for that layer are in\n    fact aware that they HAVE that responsibility.\n\n\n    3.  Definition of Terms\n\n    This document uses the term \"charset\" to mean a set of rules for\n    mapping from a sequence of octets to a sequence of characters,\n    such as the combination of a coded character set and a character\n    encoding scheme; this is also what is used as an identifier in\n    MIME \"charset=\" parameters, and registered in the IANA charset\n    registry [REG].  (Note that this is NOT a term used by other\n    standards bodies, such as ISO).\n\n    For a definition of the term \"coded character set\", refer to the\n    workshop report.\n\n    A \"name\" is an identifier such as a person's name, a hostname, a\n    domainname, a filename or an E-mail address; it is often treated\n    as an identifier rather than as a piece of text, and is often used\n    in protocols as an identifier for entities, without surrounding\n    text.\n\n\n    3.1.  What charset to use\n\n    All protocols MUST identify, for all character data, which charset\n    is in use.\n\n    Protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8 charset, which consists of\n    the ISO 10646 coded character set combined with the UTF-8\n    character encoding scheme, as defined in [10646] Annex R\n    (published in Amendment 2), for all text.\n\n    Protocols MAY specify, in addition, how to use other charsets or\n    other character encoding schemes for ISO 10646, such as UTF-16,\n    but lack of an ability to use UTF-8 is a violation of this policy;\n    such a violation would need a variance procedure ([BCP9] section\n    9) with clear and solid justification in the protocol\n    specification document before being entered into or advanced upon\n    the standards track.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 3]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    For existing protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n    datastores, support of other charsets, or even using a default\n    other than UTF-8, may be a requirement. This is acceptable, but\n    UTF-8 support MUST be possible.\n\n    When using other charsets than UTF-8, these MUST be registered in\n    the IANA charset registry, if necessary by registering them when\n    the protocol is published.\n\n    (Note: ISO 10646 calls the UTF-8 CES a \"Transformation Format\"\n    rather than a \"character encoding scheme\", but it fits the charset\n    workshop report definition of a character encoding scheme).\n\n\n\n    3.2.  How to decide a charset\n\n    In some cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n    communication between the producer and the consumer of data\n    containing text. In such cases, it may make sense to negotiate a\n    charset before sending data.\n\n    In other cases, like E-mail or stored data, there is no such\n    communication, and the best one can do is to make sure the charset\n    is clearly identified with the stored data, and choosing a charset\n    that is as widely known as possible.\n\n    Note that a charset is an absolute; text that is encoded in a\n    charset cannot be rendered comprehensibly without supporting that\n    charset.\n\n    (This also applies to English texts; charsets like EBCDIC do NOT\n    have ASCII as a proper subset)\n\n    Negotiating a charset may be regarded as an interim mechanism that\n    is to be supported until support for interchange of UTF-8 is\n    prevalent; however, the timeframe of \"interim\" may be at least 50\n    years, so there is every reason to think of it as permanent in\n    practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 4]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    4.  Languages\n\n\n    4.1.  The need for language information\n\n    All human-readable text has a language.\n\n    Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n    synthesis, searching, hyphenation, spellchecking and so on benefit\n    greatly from access to information about the language of a piece\n    of text. [WC 3.1.1.4].\n\n    Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are\n    generally very unhappy with being presented text in a language\n    they do not understand; this is why negotiation of language is\n    needed.\n\n    In most cases, machines will not be able to deduce the language of\n    a transmitted text by themselves; the protocol must specify how to\n    transfer the language information if it is to be available at all.\n\n    The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n    instance, if I compare \"name-of-thing(lang=en)\" to \"name-of-\n    thing(lang=no)\" for equality, I will generally expect a match,\n    while the word \"ask(no)\" is a kind of tree, and is hardly useful\n    as a command verb.\n\n\n    4.2.  Requirement for language tagging\n\n    Protocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying information\n    about the language of that text.\n\n    Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n    language of names, where appropriate.\n\n    Note that this does NOT mean that such information must always be\n    present; the requirement is that if the sender of information\n    wishes to send information about the language of a text, the\n    protocol provides a well-defined way to carry this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 5]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    4.3.  How to identify a language\n\n    The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n    available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n    or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n    the document.\n\n    Note also that a language is distinct from a POSIX locale; a POSIX\n    locale identifies a set of cultural conventions, which may imply a\n    language (the POSIX or \"C\" locale of course do not), while a\n    language tag as described in RFC 1766 identifies only a language.\n\n\n    4.4.  Considerations for language negotiation\n\n    Protocols where users have text presented to them in response to\n    user actions MUST provide for support of multiple languages.\n\n    How this is done will vary between protocols; for instance, in\n    some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n    cases, a server may choose to send multiple variants of a text and\n    let the client pick which one to display.\n\n    Negotiation is useful in the case where one side of the protocol\n    exchange is able to present text in multiple languages to the\n    other side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\n    the most common example is the text part of error responses, or\n    Web pages that are available in multiple languages.\n\n    Negotiating a language should be regarded as a permanent\n    requirement of the protocol that will not go away at any time in\n    the future.\n\n    In many cases, it should be possible to include it as part of the\n    connection establishment, together with authentication and other\n    preferences negotiation.\n\n\n    4.5.  Default Language\n\n    When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n    sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n    (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 6]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n    The Default Language is English, since this is the language which\n    the greatest number of people will be able to get adequate help in\n    interpreting when working with computers.\n\n    Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n    Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n    situations. It may be appropriate for application designers to\n    make sure that messages in Default Language are understandable to\n    people with a limited understanding of the English language.\n\n\n    5.  Locale\n\n    The POSIX standard [POSIX] defines a concept called a \"locale\",\n    which includes a lot of information about collating order for\n    sorting, date format, currency format and so on.\n\n    In some cases, and especially with text where the user is expected\n    to do processing on the text, locale information may be usefully\n    attached to the text; this would identify the sender's opinion\n    about appropriate rules to follow when processing the document,\n    which the recipient may choose to agree with or ignore.\n\n    This document does not require the communication of locale\n    information on all text, but encourages its inclusion when\n    appropriate.\n\n    Note that language and character set information will often be\n    present as parts of a locale tag (such as no_NO.iso-8859-1; the\n    language is before the underscore and the character set is after\n    the dot); care must be taken to define precisely which\n    specification of character set and language applies to any one\n    text item.\n\n    The default locale is the \"POSIX\" locale.\n\n\n    6.  Documenting internationalization decisions\n\n    In documents that deal with internationalization issues at all, a\n    synopsis of the approaches chosen for internationalization SHOULD\n    be collected into a section called \"Internationalization\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Dec 97                    [Page 7]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                     June 97\n\n\n    considerations\", and placed next to the Security Considerations\n    section.\n\n    This provides an easy reference for those who are looking for\n    advice on these issues when implementing the protocol.\n\n\n    7.  Security considerations\n\n    Apart from the fact that security warnings in a foreign language\n    may cause inappropriate behaviour from the user, and the fact that\n    multilingual systems usually have problems with consistency\n    between language variants, no security considerations relevant\n    have been identified.\n\n\n    8.

It happens sometimes and that's all there is to it. We can\nput in a myraid of disclaimers and people will still draw the wrong\nconclusions. However, what will happen is that they will draw more of them\nbecause of the added complexity. They may not be the same ones, but they will\nstill be wrong. All this sort of nonsense does is clutter up what should be\nclear, crisp specification with irrelevant material.\n\nMorover, what we do know is that certain interoperability problems are solved\nby language tagging. And perhaps more to the point, the IESG has indicated that\nthe IAB report is being taken very seriously and that protocols either provide\nthe necessary facilities or else they aren't likely to approved for placement\non the standards track. As such, until and unless we document this reality we\nare not giving protocol developers the tools they need to do the job right the\nfirst time.\n\nAnd because of all this we have a clear need to indicate that such tagging is\nrequired. And as long as we don't say that this isn't a sinecure and\nisn't the answer to every i18n problem out there, this is where our\nresponsibility ends.\n\n> Specifically, I also agree that language tags are a big help\n> to current stupid machines.

We have ample\nexperience with protocol design and that experience tells us that protocol\ndesigners don't go out of their way to label things. In fact it's the devil's\nown job to get them to do the minimal amount of proper labelling that's\nactually needed. The trend is so strongly in the other direction that I feel\nconfident in saying that there is absolutely no danger of this ever happening.\n\nThis also presupposes a level of cluelessness on the part of WG chairs, area\ndirectors and directorates, the IESG, and the IAB that I almost find offensive.\nWe do have checks and balances in this process, you know.\n\nI urge you to run, not walk, to your nearest bookstore and pick up a copy of\nthe book \"The Death of Common Sense\". It explains far better than I ever can\nhow making rules that assume the people involved are stupid and hence won't\nfollow the intent rather than the letter of a specification is a recipe which,\nfar from preventing disasters, tends to guarantee them.\n\nWe seem to do extraordinarily well in the IETF when we make specifications that\nreveal clear intentions rather than trying to legislate down to the last picky\ndetail. And for this reason alone I'm opposed to having much of  anything other\nthan a requirement that there be a way to tag material as to the language it is\nwritten in.\n\n> and we thereby give\n> implementors the impression that that's all they have to do,\n> and text-to-speech conversion, machine-translation, spelling\n> and grammar checks, hyphenation, high-quality display, and\n> subtile glyph distinctions maybe necessary for names, and so on,\n> will work magically and perfectly, then we clearly create the\n> wrong impression.\n\nI have seen nothing in any of the specifications we're talking about that\na reasonable person could take to mean any of this.

The Unicode Standard is code-for-\n code identical to the International Standard ISO/IEC 10646.\n\n For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web\n site at <http://www.unicode.org> or e-mail <unicode-inc@unicode.org>.\n\n\n (R) 'Unicode' is a registered trademark of Unicode, Inc.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAny views expressed in this message are those of the individual  sender,\nexcept  where  the  sender  specifically  states them to be the views of\nReuters Ltd.\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Please cite the protocol design being undertaken at this\ntime where there's a proposal on the table with the specific goal of allowing\nand encouraging individual character tagging.\n\nPlease note that designs like MIME encoded-words and MLSF which do allow\nindividual character tagging, do NOT qualify. The fact that these designs allow\nindividual character tagging (albeit in a very painful and artificial way) is a\nartefact of the design constraints these things operate under. It is NOT an\nexplicit goal of the design in either case, and as such these designs would not\nbe invalidated in any way by any rule we make here. The most that would happen\nis that they would have to adopt some very complex and confusing profiling\nrules that will almost certainly cause more problems than they solve, which is\none of the reasons why I don't want this door opened to begin with.\n\nUntil and unless you can come with a case of a design where this goal is\nspecifically present and being pursued I will continue to regard this entire\nthing as a strawman.\n\n> > This also presupposes a level of cluelessness on the part of WG chairs, are\na\n> > directors and directorates, the IESG, and the IAB that I almost find offens\nive.\n> > We do have checks and balances in this process, you know.\n\n> I know.

These are very different things. When people refuse to discuss these\nmatters with you it is because you persist in dragging in the \"should they be\nthere\" consideration and they regard that issue as settled. You may not like it\nand frankly most of the time they may not either, but the requirement is a done\ndeal informally and is about to become a done deal formally. And thus people\naren't interested in listening to you go on and on about how language can be\ndeduced from content and thus eliminate the need for tagging entirely. They are\ninstead interesting in building protocols that will be able to  make it onto\nthe standards track.\n\nThe granularity issue, on the other hand, is still there, but the design\nconstraints on it typically arise from the protocol in question rather than any\nneed, real or imagined, for a given level of granularity to exist because a\nparticular level of tagging is a Good Thing. And I will be the first to state,\nand even proclaim, that the level where tags are added often ends up being less\nthan ideal, as it certainly is in, say, encoded-words. (In particular, comment\nstring level granularity is OK, but the ability to switch character sets and\nlanguages on a character by character basis in phrases is overkill. But\nunfortunately the minute you set out to build a system that allows different\nphrases to be in different character sets and languages you either end up with\none that has too small a level of granularity or one that is much too complex\nto be useful. I should know since I was the author of one of the too complex\nalternatives back when MIME was designed.)\n\nAnd this is why I don't want to make rules about the level of granularity that\nhas to be provided: It presupposes not only that protocol designers and the\nIESG are incompetent to decide these things themselves, it also presupposes\nthat we can at this time know all the constraints designers will be operating\nunder. For all you or I know the next 200 protocols that language tagging are\nadded to in the IETF will all be of a sort where the only viable alternative\ndue to the characteristics of the protocol itself will be to build facilities\nthat allow tagging down to the individual character. (I doubt very very much\nthat this will be the case, but it is nevertheless possible.)\n\n> Anyway, if you an others assure me that my concerns are not\n> (or not anymore) justified, I am ready to accept that.\n> I sincerely hope I don't have to come back to it later.\n\nI see no evidence that supports a view that you will have to.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It's of course difficult, and in addition indecent,\nto try to judge myself in any way, but I would not like to deny\nthat I have a certain grasp on some of these issues, and I think you\nhaven't been the first one to recommend me as you described above.\n\n\nWhere you assumed too much was when you assumed, from whatever\nexperience I seemed to posses, in the fields of internationalization\nand multilinguism, an actual experience in implementing RFC 1522/2047.\nBecause this may (or may not) be your prime point of contact with\nthese issues, and because you are most probably the single top\nexpert worldwide for MIME, it's not too difficult to find an explanation\nfor why that may have happened.\n\n\nTo help you in avoiding such surprises in the future, here a list\nof some of the things I have done in (terms of implementation, i.e.\nactual programming, and not including unrelated topics):\n\n- Implemented a general architecture for character encoding conversion,\n        to and from Unicode, for an object-oriented application framework,\n        including about twenty encodings, and code-guessing for Japanese,\n        Korean,... This was mainly for pure plain-text files, but the\n        underlying input/output architecture with streams and stacked\n        filters/buffers would not make it too difficult to use it for MIME,\n        or for other kinds of in-text code switching such as pre Word97\n        RTF files.\n\n- Implemented a general localization architecture (for the same framework)\n        that allows to change menu languages on the fly and separate\n        for separate windows of the same application, and that avoids\n        that a programmer has to change the internal code (no need\n        to include \"gettext\" calls,...). [This is in use in an actual\n        product, although there it is currently limited to Latin-1.]\n\n- Implemented a general framework for keyboard input, including input\n        for Korean Hangul (with backtracking) and Japanese (SKK) as\n        well as many simpler cases.\n\n- Implemented a general framework for multilingual/multiscript text\n        display capable of handling things such as Arabic, Tamil,\n        and CJK glyph disambiguation, with flexible fallback mechanisms\n        in case fonts are missing or incomplete.\n\n(all the above in C++)\n\nThe above framework was also used in an actual mail UA, which was\ndevelopped in Montreal as an University-Industry collaboration, and\nwhich reached alpha stage and is still available on the net.\nFor propriety reasons, I have never seen the source of that mailer.\n\n\n- Built a database and manipulation software for Japanese Kanji composition/\n        decomposition, written in Prolog so that flexible queries can\n        easily be made.\n\nIn all of the above, there are things I would do again the same,\nthings I would vary depending on circumstances, things I would\nlike to add if I had time, and of course things I would do\nsomewhat or even completely differently.\n\n\nPlease judge whether the experience listed above \"far exeeds your own\"\nor not. And as for disagreements, I have to say that there probably\nisn't a single expert in the UTC or the ISO bodies or the IETF or\nW3C WGs I have been in contact with who wouldn't disagree on one\nissue or another. And that's probably the same in every technical\nfield.\n\n\n> And let me tell you that the\n> handling of encoded words containing characters in multibyte charsets is in\n> fact quite tricky and difficult to get right.\n\nBecause, as far as I have read, there is the requirement that an encoded\nword contains whole characters, this is indeed true, because you have\nto know where the character boundaries are.\n\n\n> > The same for the\n> > language specification for parameters defined in PVCSC, it is\n> > one language per parameter, which is not individual character tagging.\n\n> This is true only because the design space allowed it and the design was\n> actually simplified by imposing this restriction.

I never said that you have to use larger\ngranularity at all costs. The only thing I want to say is that\ngranularity is an issue, think about what it means for each\nprotocol, in particular if you have design choices that are\ncomparable otherwise. And because more protocols will hopefully\nhave language tag support from the beginning, they *will* have\nmore choices and less constraints.\n\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

The listing of a new amendment has to\nbe requested on the \"charsets\" list, and is treated in the same\nway as other requests for charset registration procedurally.\nThe moment there is a serious problem, that process is stopped,\nand the process is resumed on a higher level (UTF-8 RFC or whatever).\n\nJust an idea, but I really think this shouldn't be necessary.\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\nP.S.: I almost finished a list of comments to the 01 UTF-8 draft\n        from Francois.

And I\nseriously hope that they deliver in a way that will make it\nclear that these embedded language tags are ment for special\noccasions, and are not ment e.g. to pollute out of those\nrestricted areas they are officially allowed.\n\nBut I continue to wonder: If you think that a character set has to\nhave embedded language tags, why for example don't you first go to\nyour national standards body (ANSI) and help them to get language tags\ninto ASCII, to be able to distinguish English and Hawaiian, at least?\nOr why don't you propose to include language tags in the ISO-8859-X series,\nwhere each part of the series is used for a great multitude of languages?\nWhat's so special about UCS and UTF-8 that the international standard\nbodies suddenly have to \"deliver\"? What makes you, as an individual,\nso special that you think you are entitled to ask them to \"deliver\".\nOr do you think you could imagine the IESG, as the representative\nof the IETF, to formally send a note, in the style as above, or as\nsome MLSF proponents have expressed themselves to UTC members, to\nISO and UTC?\n\n\n> (2) If MLSF needs to be revived I for one will support it.\n\nYou are of course free to support whatever you think you want to\nsupport. But I would really like at that point to hear better\ntechnical arguments from you and the other MLSF supporters than\nwhat I have heard up to now. The only technical argument in\nfavor of MLSF that I have heard is that it is good for internal\nprocessing in some cases. I agree with that, but we all know that\nthis is largely irrelevant for the IETF.\n\nAnd the technical problems with MLSF, as they have been discussed,\nwon't go away just because there is no \"delivery\". Just to make\nsure, these technical problems have nothing to do with whether\ninline language tags are desirable or not. Even if I were the\nstrongest supporter of inline language tags (which I admit I'm\nnot), I wouldn't want to ruin UTF-8 with MLSF.\n\n\n>     As such, I have\n>     no intention of putting something in a document that would prevent this\n>     from happening unless and until I am specifically directed to do so by\n>     either an AD or a WG chair with jurisdiction over the charset registratio\nn\n>     specification.\n\nWe are currently not discussing the charset registration specification.\nWe are discussing Harald's policy document.

And some\npeople in that debate specifically mentionned that they thought\nthat ACAP needed to be able to tag each word, at least, because\nthey thought that RFC 2130 said so.\n\nYou asked why I think that just saying \"all protocols have to\nuse language tags\" (or some such) may be insufficient, and ACAP\nand MLSF are the specific examples that make me think so. So\nthat's why ACAP and MLSF are relevant here.\n\n\n> > It was a clear strawman.

But I see a big difference\nbetween MIME encoded words (as extended in the pvcsc spec) and MLSF.\n\nOn the technical side, PVCSC does not apply to characters, it applies\nto encoded words. Encoded words have to be separated by linear white\nspace (which is not removed when decoding the encoded words, as far\nas I understand), and can only have one language.  The same for the\nlanguage specification for parameters defined in PVCSC, it is\none language per parameter, which is not individual character tagging.\nAlso, the header syntax is indeed clumsy, but encoded words without\nlanguage tags are already clumsy enough, and the added clumsiness\nis not really much. So it's word-based tagging, somewhat painful\nbut not really a big deal, and designed to the constraints of MIME\nand email.\n\nMLSF, in particular the way it was presented and defended by it's\nproponent(s) on the unicore list, is (or hopefully *was*) completely\ndifferent. First, it is pure individual character tagging. A tag\ncan be put in at any place whatsoever. Second, it ruined the clean\nproperties of UTF-8, risking to blow up a lot of converters in\nunpredictable ways. Third, the design constraints of ACAP didn't\nnecessitate at all. It was a clear strawman. I remember naively\nproposing alternatives such as using metainformation for language,\nwhich was rejected on I don't remember what supposedly technical\nreasons. When I subscribed to the ACAP WG mailing list and had a\nlook at the archives, I easily found mails discussing language as\nmetainformation. But to the outside, this was withheld and denied,\nbecause some people felt that they *just needed* individual character\ntagging, but were not ready to discuss this technically in true\nIETF manner, but rather preferred to claim that they represented\nthe IETF because they correctly assumed that most of their counterparts\ndidn't have much of a clue about IETF process.\n\nFred - I don't mind having individual character tagging where it makes\nsense. It is possible with <SPAN> and LANG in HTML. It may make a lot\nof sense in other places. But I have been seriously burnt by claims,\nwrongly based on the IAB report [RFC 2070], that all text in internet\nprotocols needs individual character tagging, and by upfront pseudo-\narguments claiming technical necessities where there existed alternatives.\n\nThat has happened, and if I worry about it happening again, that's\nnot a strawman at all.\n\n\n> It is NOT an\n> explicit goal of the design in either case, and as such these designs would n\not\n> be invalidated in any way by any rule we make here.

But what you and others are confusing is that\nfirst of all, I'm not against language tagging. Otherwise, I wouldn't\nhave coauthored RFC 2070, and I wouldn't have spent quite a bit of my\ntime this year helping to bring all of RFC 2070 into HTML 4.0.\n\nWhen I ask people in discussions about why language tagging is needed,\nthe main aim is to try to help them make sure they understand what\nlanguage means in their protocol (e.g. whether and where they need\nnegotiation or alternatives,...) and how they can best handle it.\n\nWhen I sometimes argue against language tagging in a particular variety\nor for a particular application, it's because I want to help people\nunderstand the benefits and limits of language tagging.\n\nI'm not confusing the question of whether we need language tagging at\nall with the question of granularity. But I know there is a danger that\nother people make this confusion, on purpose or inadvertedly, and I\nwould like to make sure it doesn't happen.\n\nAlso, I think that the primary interest of the IETF and all its\nparticipant is in making good protocols, and to design the standards\ntrack process so that we can make pretty sure good protocols make it,\nand protocols with problems don't. There is no use in a protocol\nto just plug in an arbitrary security mechanism in without them\nthinking about why they need security and what kind of security\nthey may need and how they make sure that works together with the\nrest of the protocol. A WG that just reads the IETF security\nrequirements, follows them to the word, but in fact thinks\n\"what the hell with security, but gee, we have to give them\nsomething so that we go standards track\" is not really what\nwe want. And the same applies to internationalization and\nmultilingual issues.\n\n\n\n> And this is why I don't want to make rules about the level of granularity tha\nt\n> has to be provided: It presupposes not only that protocol designers and the\n> IESG are incompetent to decide these things themselves, it also presupposes\n> that we can at this time know all the constraints designers will be operating\n> under.\n\nI never proposed to make *rules* about granularity. The only thing\nI proposed was to mention granularity as such, as one (important)\naspect of language tagging, to help designers get aware of the\nfact that this is an issue, and to avoid claims by people that\nwould like to see it like this that \"language tagging means\nyou have to be able to tag each single character\".\n\n\n> > Anyway, if you an others assure me that my concerns are not\n> > (or not anymore) justified, I am ready to accept that.\n> > I sincerely hope I don't have to come back to it later.\n\n> I see no evidence that supports a view that you will have to.\n\nMany thanks for your optimism.\n\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

You can object all you want, but since this is not a WG\n    there's no chair, so unless you can convince either Harald or Keith\n    that such language belongs in the document it simply is not going to\n    happen.\n\n> On the technical side, PVCSC does not apply to characters, it applies\n> to encoded words. Encoded words have to be separated by linear white\n> space (which is not removed when decoding the encoded words, as far\n> as I understand), and can only have one language.\n\nI'm afraid your understanding is totally incorrect. From RFC2047:\n\n   When displaying a particular header field that contains multiple\n   'encoded-word's, any 'linear-white-space' that separates a pair of\n   adjacent 'encoded-word's is ignored.  (This is to allow the use of\n   multiple 'encoded-word's to represent long strings of unencoded text,\n   without having to separate 'encoded-word's where spaces occur in the\n   unencoded text.)\n\nThe problem is that encoded-words have length restrictions and restrictions\non how they can be presented. The two combine to produce a requirement that\nit be possible to use multiple encoded-words to represent a long string. And\nthis of course opens the door up to having each character in a different\ncharset and language.\n\nI also note in passing that your fundamental misunderstanding of encoded-words\neither means either you have never implemented any of this or if you have you\nhaven't done it properly. And I must confess that I am very disappointed by\nthis. I had always assumed that you had substantive experience with both\ncharset design and implementation of charset support -- experience that far\nexceeded my own, and that our present disagreement arose mostly out of a\ndisconnect between the way the IETF does business and what you've seen happen\nin other venues. In fact I have even gone so far as to recommend you as someone\nwith a good grasp of these issues.\n\nI now see that my assessment was wrong. And I hasten to add that any fault --\nif fault is the right word -- is mine and mine alone -- you never\nmisrepresented your abilities or experience. I simply assumed too much, and now\nhave to revise my opinion.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that this is one of those things where if you\nhaven't either implemented it yourself or tried to support an implementation in\nreal-world use you cannot possibly know, let alone understand, the real-world\nissues that come up. I've done both -- I've done not one but two\nimplementations of encoded-word support, both in commercial products that are\nwidely used in over 50 countries, and I have done ongoing support work on both\nand continue to do so at the present time. And let me tell you that the\nhandling of encoded words containing characters in multibyte charsets is in\nfact quite tricky and difficult to get right. And language tags make it even\nworse -- I have preliminary support in place for them so I think it is at least\ndoable, but I'm a ways away from actually trusting that I have all the details\nright. (And in this case there's an entire pantheon of devils in the details.)\n\n> The same for the\n> language specification for parameters defined in PVCSC, it is\n> one language per parameter, which is not individual character tagging.\n\nThis is true only because the design space allowed it and the design was\nactually simplified by imposing this restriction. Had the design space not\nallowed it (as it doesn't for encoded-words) or had the design been made overly\ncomplex by having this restriction it would not be there.\n\nAnd I believe this again demonstrates the essential fallacy that lies behind\nyour entire train of thought here. This mechanism was designed _long_ before\nyou starting talking about the evils of per-character language tags. And yet\nthe design of the language extension to MIME parameter values naturally evolved\nalong the lines of not having a tagging granularity that's too fine. You\nyourself are saying here that it is just right.\n\nWhen the tagging granularity is too fine it is a result of the design\nconstraints of the protocol being extended. And since we cannot control these\nconstraints we cannot mandate a particular granularity level for tagging.\n\n> Also, the header syntax is indeed clumsy, but encoded words without\n> language tags are already clumsy enough, and the added clumsiness\n> is not really much.

It situations where these charsets are allowed for us we've\nalready taken steps to add language tagging facilities.\n\nIn other words, I do think that language tagging is an issue for these charsets\nas well, it is just that situations where multiple charsets are allowed\naren't the same as where UTF-8 or UCS is being used without any tagging\nfacilities being present.\n\n> What's so special about UCS and UTF-8 that the international standard\n> bodies suddenly have to \"deliver\"?\n\nWhat is special is the notion that these are truly universal charsets that can\nbe used in places without any other charsets or tagging being necessary or even\nallowed.\n\nThis makes them completely unique in my book (and very welcome), and it means\nthat they end up with three obligations that no other charset has:\n\n(1) They have to be willing to accomodate the addition of whatever characters\n    are needed to support additional languages or scripts.\n\n(2) They cannot change extant character assignments.\n\n(3) They have to allow for whatever sorts of inline tagging are necessary\n    for rendition.\n\n> What makes you, as an individual,\n> so special that you think you are entitled to ask them to \"deliver\".\n\nThere is nothing special about me as an individual. However, as a protocol\ndesigner, I feel that I have a right to operate under rules that let me get my\nwork done. And for that to be possible we have three choices:\n\n(1) Rescind the language tagging requirement the IAB has specified.\n(2) Devise a facility of our own for inline tagging for the situations where\n    out of band tagging is either unavailable or unsufficient. This is MLSF.\n(3) Ask the UTC and ISO to deliver a facility.\n\nMy assessment is that there is no chance of (1) happening. The consensus to use\nUTF-8/UCS is predicated on this being done, and the minute you move away from\nit you lose the consensus as well. So (2) was proposed for situations where\ninline tagging is the obvious answer, and most of the people in the protocol\ncommunity pretty much liked it. (And some even loved it.) The UTC/ISO people\nhated it, however, but they aren't the ones who have to deliver workable\nprotocols, so their arguments as to its functionality mismatch at the charset\nlevel were not and are not very effective. So they instead proposed (3), and\nmost of us said, \"That's fine as long as you actually deliver it, if not, we'll\ngo back to (2) or something with similar capabilities\".\n\n> Or do you think you could imagine the IESG, as the representative\n> of the IETF, to formally send a note, in the style as above, or as\n> some MLSF proponents have expressed themselves to UTC members, to\n> ISO and UTC?\n\nThis is pretty much what has already been done.\n\n> > (2) If MLSF needs to be revived I for one will support it.\n\n> You are of course free to support whatever you think you want to\n> support.

If that fails then I will review my options and will\nprobably become an MLSF supporter, unless of course someone proposes something\nbetter than MLSF.\n\nSo what you have here is yet another strawman, since nobody here is arguing in\nfavor of MLSF, least of all me. All I'm saying is that I strong object to\ntrying to  close the door on schemes like MLSF at this time.\n\n> And the technical problems with MLSF, as they have been discussed,\n> won't go away just because there is no \"delivery\".

As far as MLSF goes I don't have the time, need, or interest in\nfurther discussion of a proposal that isn't even on the table right now and if\nall goes will never will be in the future. Should the UTC/ISO fail to\nget tagging codepoints into ISO 10646 I'm sure MLSF will be revived. But I'm\nalso sure that other alternatives will be proposed, and then they will\nall be evaluated on their technical merits.\n\n> >     As such, I have\n> >     no intention of putting something in a document that would prevent this\n> >     from happening unless and until I am specifically directed to do so by\n> >     either an AD or a WG chair with jurisdiction over the charset registrat\nion\n> >     specification.\n\n> We are currently not discussing the charset registration specification.\n> We are discussing Harald's policy document.

Even supposing that you're\ncorrect in saying that ACAP metadata could be used for language tags, all that\nwould mean is that in ACAP there is no need for fine granularity language tags.\nBut ACAP is just one protocol, and the guidelines we're trying to come up with\nhere are intended to be completely general. Unless and until you're prepared to\nsay that tags with fine granularity are never necessary (and we already have a\ncounter-example in encoded-words) we should not include the sort of language\nyou're talking about.\n\nNow, even though your ACAP issue isn't relevant, I will answer it: The basic\nproblem in ACAP is that metadata isn't of fine enough granularity to be used\nfor language tagging. There are problems with multi-valued attributes, for\nexample. So, given the present protocol specification, it really isn't possible\nto add metadata for this and have a workable result. And while the protocol\ncould of course be changed to \"fix\" this, if you sit down and work out all the\nconsequences (I haven't done so, but I've watched it being done) you find that\nit screws up the protocol tremendously and makes things vastly more complex.\nWhen compared with the simplicity of inline tagging it just doesn't measure up.\n\nIn other words, this is a protocol design issue where it seems to the protocol\ndesigners that the right answer is finer level of tagging granularity than what\nyou'd like to see them pick. But even if the ACAP designers are completely\nwrong about this it would not you're correct, since for you to be right you'd\nhave to be right about every protocol.\n\n> > > Fred - I don't mind having individual character tagging where it makes\n> > > sense.

I have stated publicly that I will\nonly support MLSF should the necessary facilities not appear in ISO 10646.\n\nBut the occasion for reintroduction aside, this is in fact _exactly_ what I'm\ndoing and I see nothing wrong with doing it. I'm not attempting to prevent MLSF\nfrom receiving appropriate technical review should the occasion arise to revive\nit. I'm not attempting to block other alternatives to MLSF. In fact this comes\nto pass and an alternative to MLSF is presented that is superior I will support\nit in favor of MLSF.\n\nThe point is that we have a solution on the table -- embedded tagging\ncodepoints in ISO 10646 -- that it seems all of us can live with. But it isn't\na sure thing yet. So we're keeping some alternatives in reserve should the\ncurrent solution that's on the table run afoul of some UTC or ISO glitch. It\nis simply common sense for us to do so, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nYou, on the other hand, want us basically to either ban or make it difficult to\npursue other alternatives even before we know that we have a solution in place.\nWe're being asked for advance payment prior to possible receipt.\n\nBasically this boils down to a matter of trust. Should the IETF trust the UTC\nand ISO to deliver on their promise and in the meantime in part give up some of\ntheir ability to fix things should something go wrong? Should the UTC\nand ISO trust the IETF to use what they've built and not build something else\nthat's unnecessary?\n\nIn my opinion the IETF has proved itself worthy of such trust, not once but\nover and over and over again. This is why I continue to ask if you have a\ncounterexample in the form of something that's either been approved by\nthe IETF or is actually on the table now in the IETF that would demonstrate\notherwise. And it seem fairly clear now that you have no such example to\npresent.\n\nAnd frankly, I think things like the Hangul mess amply demonstrate why the IETF\nwould be abrograting its responsibility of being able to live up to its\nobligation to be able to build protocols that meet its own rules by adding the\nsort of text you suggest at this time. Maybe in a year or two, when the\ntagging codepoints are set in stone and we have substantially more experience\nwith their use in various protocols. But not now.\n\n                                Ned\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

There is terminology distinguishing\n'multibyte' and 'wide character', and UCS-2 and UCS-4 seem to\nbelong to the later category rather than to the former.\n\nBut this is a terminological nitpick which maybe isn't worth\npersuing.\n\n> 1.  Introduction\n\n>    ISO/IEC 10646-1 [ISO-10646] defines a multi-octet character set\n>    called the Universal Character Set (UCS), which encompasses most of\n>    the world's writing systems.

There are plans for assignements in\nplane 1 and plane 2, and there is the plane 14 proposal.\n\n\n\n>    It is noteworthy that the same set of characters is defined by the\n>    Unicode standard [UNICODE], which further defines additional charac-\n>    ter properties and other application details of great interest to\n>    implementors, but does not have the UCS-4 encoding.

Set of characters sounds like it's only the same\nrepertoire (set in the mathematical sense).\nAlso, \"does not have the UCS-4 encoding\" may be read as if UCS-2\nis the only encoding in Unicode, so that it is limited to 64K.\nAcutally, Unicode uses UTF-16, so it is not restricted to 64K.\n\n\n>    The UCS-2 and UCS-4 encodings, however, are hard to use in many cur-\n>    rent applications and protocols that assume 8 or even 7 bit charac-\n>    ters.

With MIME or with ESMTP,\nUTF-8 is also safe.

UCS-2 only encompasses the\ncharacters directly assigned in the BMP. As soon as you use the\nsurrogate area, it is no longer UCS-2, it is UTF-16.\nIt is true (and very important!) that when transcoding UTF-16 to\nUTF-8, the surrogate area (this is an Unicode term; the ISO\nterm is different) needs special treatment.\n\n\n>    UTF-8 encodes UCS-2 or UCS-4 characters as a varying number of\n>    octets, where the number of octets, and the value of each, depend on\n>    the integer value assigned to the character in ISO/IEC 10646.

Agenbroad    Andries Brouwer\n>    Martin J. D\u00fcrst       Ned Freed\n\nPlease replace the \u00fc by 'ue'. Past experience with the RFC editor\nhas shown that it's not possible to smuggle such things past him/her,\nand I prefer to end up an Duerst rather than as Drst or D|rst or\nwhatever. And I guess next time you try, you should try with UTF-8\ninstead of iso-8859-1 :-).\n\n\nThis concludes the nits on the draft itself. There is one other\npoint I would like to mention:\n\nThere was some discussion about whether the UTF-8 encoding of the BOM\nwould be acceptable as a \"magic number\". There is of course no need to\nhave the BOM (byte order mark) for byte ordering purposes, there is only\none byte ordering in UTF-8. But it still can make sense purely as a\nmagic number. It would be nice if there was a clear statement about whether\nand when this is possible/desirable, but I don't know whether consensus\non this issue has been reached or can be reached. Because in the\ncontext of the IETF, UTF-8 is either identified by label (e.g. mail\nheaders and bodies), or is the only encoding (e.g. ACAP), or appears\nin short identifiers where the use of a BOM would only complicate\nthings (e.g. FTP file names), I can see two solutions:\n\nA) For IETF protocols, the BOM is not allowed as a magic number in UTF-8.\n        [It is of course at the discression of local implementations to\n        use it as a magic number, but it then has to be removed before\n        sending.]\n\nB) For IETF protocols, the BOM is strongly discouraged for running text\n        and disallowed for identifiers. Implementations should accept and\n        remove the BOM in the sense of \"be liberal in what you accept\".\n\n\nRegards,        Martin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Abstract\n\n> MIME [RFC-2045, RFC-2046, RFC-2047, RFC-2184] and various\n> other modern Internet protocols are capable of using many\n> different charsets. This in turn means that the ability to\n> label different charsets is essential. This registration\n> procedure exists solely to associate a specific name or names\n> with a given charset and to give an indication of whether or\n> not a given charset can be used in MIME text objects. In\n> particular, the general applicability and appropriateness of a\n> given registered charset is a protocol issue, not a\n> registration issue, and is not dealt with by this registration\n> procedure.\n\nMIME is cited in full; maybe it would be nice to have some\nother references for other Internet protocols. The most\nimportant ones I know (HTTP,...) do so by reference to\nMIME, but there may be others.\n\n\n> 2.2.  Character\n\n> A member of a set of elements used for the organisation,\n> control, or representation of data.\n\nVerbatim from ISO standards. A refenence might help\npeople to understand that this definition is the same\nas the ISO definition.\n\n\n> 2.3.  Charset\n\n> The term \"charset\" (referred to as a \"character set\" in\n> previous versions of this document) is used here to refer to a\n> method of converting a sequence of octets into a sequence of\n> characters. This conversion may also optionally produce\n> additional control information such as directionality\n> indicators.\n\nVery good to use \"Charset\" throughout the document!\nMany people, esp. those with a math background, had\nproblems with \"character set\".\n\n\n> This definition is intended to allow charsets to be defined in\n> a variety of different ways, from simple single-table mappings\n> such as US-ASCII to complex table switching methods such as\n> those that use ISO 2022's techniques, to be used as charsets.\n\nThe last clause seems superfluos. We can speak about definition\nor use; it's the same here, because it would be strange if we\ncould define things we couldn't use or vice versa.\n\n\n> 2.5.  Character Encoding Scheme\n\n> A Character Encoding Scheme (CES) is a mapping from a Coded\n> Character Set or several coded character sets to a set of\n> octets. A given CES is typically associated with a single CCS;\n> for example, UTF-8 applies only to ISO 10646.\n\nI would change \"is typically\" to \"may be\". For the ISO-8859\nseries, the \"8bit\" mapping is associated with many CSS.\n\nIf we take the CSS as part of the CES, then \"typically\" is\nalso not adequate, because a given CES is then always\nassociated to a single CSS (or a fixed set of CSSs).\n\n\n> 3.1.  Required Characteristics\n\n> Registered charsets MUST conform to the definition of a\n> \"charset\" given above.  In addition, charsets intended for use\n> in MIME content types under the \"text\" top-level type must\n> conform to the restrictions on that type described in RFC\n> 2045. All registered charsets MUST note whether or not they\n> are suitable for use in MIME.\n\nThis is MIME as defined in RFC 2045. Other protocols, for\nbetter or for worse, in particular HTTP, have made wide\nuse of MIME while relaxing certain restrictions for the\n\"text\" top level type. A note may be in order, it may\nread e.g.:\n\nNote: MIME is used with slightly changed requirements in\nsome protocols (e.g. [HTTP]). The note \"suitable for use\nin MIME\" reflects MIME exactly as defined in RFC 2045,\nwithout any such changes.\n\n\n> All charsets which are constructed as a composition of a CCS\n> and a CES MUST either include the CCS and CES they are based\n> on in their registration or else cite a definition of their\n> CCS and CES that appears elsewhere.\n\nchange \"a CCS\" to \"one or more CCS\". And because a CCS is a\nrelation from characters to integers, this means that ALL\ncharsets are compositions of CCS and CES.\n\n\n> All registered charsets MUST be specified in a stable, openly\n> available specification. Registration of charsets whose\n> specifications aren't stable and openly available is\n> forbidden.\n\nWhat does \"stable\" mean?????\n\n\n> 3.3.  Naming Requirements\n\n> One or more names MUST be assigned to all registered charsets.\n> Multiple names for the same charset are permitted, but if\n> multiple names are assigned a single primary name for the\n> charset MUST be identified. All other names are considered to\n> be aliases for the primary name and use of the primary name is\n> preferred over use of any of the aliases.\n\nThe current IANA registry contains\n        name:\nentries,\n        alias:\nentries, and also remarks in case of some aliases about\nwhat is preferred by MIME. It would be good to mention what\n\"MIME preferred\" means; it means that although this is\nan alias, it is preferred over the \"name\".\n\n\n> Finally, charsets being registered for use with the \"text\"\n> media type MUST have a primary name that conforms to the more\n> restrictive syntax of the charset field in MIME encoded-words\n> [RFC-2047, RFC-2184] and MIME extended parameter values [RFC-\n> 2184]. A combined ABNF definition for such names is as\n> follows:\n\n>     mime-charset = 1*<Any CHAR except SPACE, CTLs, and cspecials>\n\n>     cspecials    = \"(\" / \")\" / \"<\" / \">\" / \"@\" / \",\" / \";\" / \":\" / \"\n>                    <\"> / \"/\" / \"[\" / \"]\" / \"?\" / \".\" / \"=\" / \"*\"\n\n>     CHAR         =  <any ASCII character>        ; (  0-177,  0.-127.)\n>     SPACE        =  <ASCII SP, space>            ; (     40,      32.)\n>     CTL          =  <any ASCII control           ; (  0- 37,  0.- 31.)\n>                      character and DEL>          ; (    177,     127.)\n\nThis is a very exact definition, but it's extra work for each\nregistrant (and IANA!) to figure out what the remaining set is.\nDefining it as an addition, or giving the list of allowed\ncharacters in text (e.g.: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, ....) would help\na lot.\n\n\n> 3.4.  Functionality Requirement\n\n> Charsets must function as actual charsets: Registration of\n> things that are better thought of as a transfer encoding, as a\n> media type, or as a collection of separate entities of another\n> type, is not allowed.  For example, although HTML could\n> theoretically be thought of as a charset, it is really better\n> thought of as a media type and as such it cannot be registered\n> as a charset.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense. However, I wonder whether this\nrefers more to things such as entity and attribute names,\nor whether it refers to character entities (&uuml;) and\nnumeric character references (&#1234;)?\nThings like the later of course could be defined as charsets,\nin my oppinion, but in case of HTML, this doesn't make much\nsense because there would have to be a special registration\nfor each currently used charset.\n\n\n> 4.1.  Present the Charset to the Community\n\n> Send the proposed charset registration to the \"ietf-\n> charsets@iana.org\" mailing list.  This mailing list has been\n> established for the sole purpose of reviewing proposed charset\n> registrations.\n\n\"and discussing related topics\"? Or will there be a separate\nlist for questions re. what exactly a specific registration/\nname is supposed to mean, for updates to this and related\ndocuments if they become necessary, and so on?\n\n\n> 4.2.  Charset Reviewer\n\n> When the two week period has passed and the registration\n> proposer is convinced that consensus has been achieved, the\n> registration application should be submitted to IANA and the\n> charset reviewer. The charset reviewer, who is appointed by\n> the IETF Applications Area Director(s), either approves the\n> request for registration or rejects it.

The charset reviewer may also recommend standards\n> track processing (before or after registration) when that\n> appears appropriate and the level of specification of the\n> charset is adequate.\n\nDo I understand this correctly: The \"charset reviewer\" is\nkind of like the WG chair of charsets? Good idea. But the\ntitle \"reviewer\" seems to also contain a considerable\ndirect responsibility. However, this is not menitonned\nexplicitly.\n\n\n> Decisions made by the reviewer must be posted to the ietf-\n> charsets mailing list within 14 days. Decisions made by the\n> reviewer may be appealed to the IESG.\n\nDoes this mean that once the reviewer has decided, he/she has\n14 days to post the result? This doesn't make much sense;\nposting a decision is not that big a deal, I hope. What I guess\nwas inteded (and probably is needed) here is a specification\nthat the decision, both before and after last call, has to be\nmade *and* posted within X days (where two weeks is probably\ntoo short, because a reviewer may be on holydays). How much\nthe reviewer spends of that time for deciding and how much\nfor posting is hopefully his/her own business.\n\n\n> 4.3.  IANA Registration\n\n> Provided that the charset registration has either passed\n> review or has been successfully appealed to the IESG, the IANA\n> will register the charset, assign a MIBenum value, and make\n> its registration available to the community.\n\nPlease add a short note that the registration should be anounced\non the ietf-charsets list.\n\n\n> 5.  Location of Registered Charset List\n\n> Charset registrations will be posted in the anonymous FTP file\n> \"ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets\"\n\nIANA has its own web site (only that when you access it, you\nget the ISI home page, and first have to find out you have to\nlook for the IANA under services). As we specifically create\nthe mailing list alias ieft-charsets@iana.org, it may also\nmake sense to create ftp.iana.org, or to just (or also) reference\nwww.iana.org.\n\n\n> and all registered charsets will be listed in the periodically\n> issued \"Assigned Numbers\" RFC [currently RFC-1700].  The\n> description of the charset may also be published as an\n> Informational RFC by sending it to \"rfc-editor@isi.edu\"\n> (please follow the instructions to RFC authors [RFC-1543]).\n\nIt is not very clear here (and from another paragraph above)\nwhether if a charset wants to go for RFC, that RFC has to\nexist first, or is created only after registration. What\nmakes probably most sense is that charsets that want to go\nfor RFC have to be submitted with an appropriate I-D, and\ngo to RFC when the registration is done.\n\n\n\n> 6.  Registration Template\n\n>   To: ietf-charsets@iana.org\n>   Subject: Registration of new charset XXX\n\nMay be good to have the name of the charset in the Subject line.\n\n\n>   Charset name(s):\n\n>   (All names must be suitable for use as the value of a\n>   MIME content-type parameter.)\n\n>   Published specification(s):\n\n>   (A specification for the charset must be\n>   openly available that accurately describes what\n>   is being registered. If a charset is defined as\n>   a composition of a CCS and a CES then these defintions\n>   must either be included or referenced.)\n\nSame comments as above with respect to \"a CCS\".\nMaybe this is the best place to mention: If a publication of\nthe definition of the charset as an RFC is inteded, the\n\"published specification\" must be a suitable internet draft.\n\n> 7.  Security Considerations\n\n> This registration procedure is not known to raise any sort of\n> security considerations that are appreciably different from\n> those already existing in the protocols that employ registered\n> charsets.\n\nIs there a need for security considerations in the registrations\nthemselves?

Then however, you go back to \"this is the language\",\nwhich is immediately read as \"English is the language\".\n\nSo you should probably say:\n\n    Messages in Default Language MUST be understandable by an English-\n    speaking person, since in this way, the greatest nuber of people\n    worldwide will be able to get adequate help in interpreting the\n    messages when working with computers.\n\nNote that I also put in \"worldwide\" to make it clear that that's\nwhat we care about, and not some local situation.\nAlso, I have put in a \"the messages\" to have an object for\n\"interpreting\".

Introduction\n\n    The Internet is international.\n\n    With the international Internet follows an absolute requirement to\n    interchange data in a multiplicity of languages, which in turn\n    utilize a bewildering number of characters.\n\n    This document is (INTENDED TO BE) the current policies being\n    applied by the Internet Engineering Steering Group towards the\n    standardization efforts in the Internet Engineering Task Force in\n    order to help Internet protocols fulfil these requirements.\n\n    The document is very much based upon the recommendations of the\n    IAB Character Set Workshop of February 29-March 1, 1996, which is\n    documented in RFC 2130 [WR]. This document attempts to be concise,\n    explicit and clear; people wanting more background are encouraged\n    to read RFC 2130.\n\n    The document uses the terms \"MUST\", \"SHOULD\" and \"MAY\", and their\n    negatives, in the way described in [RFC 2119]. In this case, \"the\n    specification\" as used by RFC 2119 refers to the processing of\n    protocols being submitted to the IETF standards process.\n\n\n    2.  Where to do internationalization\n\n    Internationalization is for humans. This means that protocols are\n    not subject to internationalization; text strings are. Where\n    protocol elements look like text tokens, such as in many IETF\n    application layer protocols, protocols MUST specify which parts\n    are protocol and which are text. [WR 2.2.1.1]\n\n    Names are a problem, because people feel strongly about them, many\n    of them are mostly for local usage, and all of them tend to leak\n    out of the local context at times. RFC 1958 [ARCH] recommends US-\n    ASCII for all globally visible names.\n\n    This document does not mandate a policy on name\n    internationalization, but requires that all protocols describe\n    whether names are internationalized or US-ASCII.\n\n    NOTE: In the protocol stack for any given application, there is\n    usually one or a few layers that need to address these problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Apr 98                    [Page 2]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                      Oct 97\n\n\n    It would, for instance, not be appropriate to define language tags\n    for Ethernet frames. But it is the responsibility of the WGs to\n    ensure that whenever responsibility for internationalization is\n    left to \"another layer\", those responsible for that layer are in\n    fact aware that they HAVE that responsibility.\n\n\n    3.  Definition of Terms\n\n    This document uses the term \"charset\" to mean a set of rules for\n    mapping from a sequence of octets to a sequence of characters,\n    such as the combination of a coded character set and a character\n    encoding scheme; this is also what is used as an identifier in\n    MIME \"charset=\" parameters, and registered in the IANA charset\n    registry [REG].  (Note that this is NOT a term used by other\n    standards bodies, such as ISO).\n\n    For a definition of the term \"coded character set\", refer to the\n    workshop report.\n\n    A \"name\" is an identifier such as a person's name, a hostname, a\n    domainname, a filename or an E-mail address; it is often treated\n    as an identifier rather than as a piece of text, and is often used\n    in protocols as an identifier for entities, without surrounding\n    text.\n\n\n    3.1.  What charset to use\n\n    All protocols MUST identify, for all character data, which charset\n    is in use.\n\n    Protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8 charset, which consists of\n    the ISO 10646 coded character set combined with the UTF-8\n    character encoding scheme, as defined in [10646] Annex R\n    (published in Amendment 2), for all text.\n\n    Protocols MAY specify, in addition, how to use other charsets or\n    other character encoding schemes for ISO 10646, such as UTF-16,\n    but lack of an ability to use UTF-8 is a violation of this policy;\n    such a violation would need a variance procedure ([BCP9] section\n    9) with clear and solid justification in the protocol\n    specification document before being entered into or advanced upon\n    the standards track.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Apr 98                    [Page 3]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                      Oct 97\n\n\n    For existing protocols or protocols that move data from existing\n    datastores, support of other charsets, or even using a default\n    other than UTF-8, may be a requirement. This is acceptable, but\n    UTF-8 support MUST be possible.\n\n    When using other charsets than UTF-8, these MUST be registered in\n    the IANA charset registry, if necessary by registering them when\n    the protocol is published.\n\n    (Note: ISO 10646 calls the UTF-8 CES a \"Transformation Format\"\n    rather than a \"character encoding scheme\", but it fits the charset\n    workshop report definition of a character encoding scheme).\n\n\n\n    3.2.  How to decide a charset\n\n    When the protocol allows a choice of multiple charsets, someone\n    must make a decision on which charset to use.\n\n    In some cases, like HTTP, there is direct or semi-direct\n    communication between the producer and the consumer of data\n    containing text. In such cases, it may make sense to negotiate a\n    charset before sending data.\n\n    In other cases, like E-mail or stored data, there is no such\n    communication, and the best one can do is to make sure the charset\n    is clearly identified with the stored data, and choosing a charset\n    that is as widely known as possible.\n\n    Note that a charset is an absolute; text that is encoded in a\n    charset cannot be rendered comprehensibly without supporting that\n    charset.\n\n    (This also applies to English texts; charsets like EBCDIC do NOT\n    have ASCII as a proper subset)\n\n    Negotiating a charset may be regarded as an interim mechanism that\n    is to be supported until support for interchange of UTF-8 is\n    prevalent; however, the timeframe of \"interim\" may be at least 50\n    years, so there is every reason to think of it as permanent in\n    practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Apr 98                    [Page 4]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                      Oct 97\n\n\n    4.  Languages\n\n\n    4.1.  The need for language information\n\n    All human-readable text has a language.\n\n    Many operations, including high quality formatting, text-to-speech\n    synthesis, searching, hyphenation, spellchecking and so on benefit\n    greatly from access to information about the language of a piece\n    of text. [WC 3.1.1.4].\n\n    Humans have some tolerance for foreign languages, but are\n    generally very unhappy with being presented text in a language\n    they do not understand; this is why negotiation of language is\n    needed.\n\n    In most cases, machines will not be able to deduce the language of\n    a transmitted text by themselves; the protocol must specify how to\n    transfer the language information if it is to be available at all.\n\n    The interaction between language and processing is complex; for\n    instance, if I compare \"name-of-thing(lang=en)\" to \"name-of-\n    thing(lang=no)\" for equality, I will generally expect a match,\n    while the word \"ask(no)\" is a kind of tree, and is hardly useful\n    as a command verb.\n\n\n    4.2.  Requirement for language tagging\n\n    Protocols that transfer text MUST provide for carrying information\n    about the language of that text.\n\n    Protocols SHOULD also provide for carrying information about the\n    language of names, where appropriate.\n\n    Note that this does NOT mean that such information must always be\n    present; the requirement is that if the sender of information\n    wishes to send information about the language of a text, the\n    protocol provides a well-defined way to carry this information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Apr 98                    [Page 5]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                      Oct 97\n\n\n    4.3.  How to identify a language\n\n    The RFC 1766 language tag is at the moment the most flexible tool\n    available for identifying a language; protocols SHOULD use this,\n    or provide clear and solid justification for doing otherwise in\n    the document.\n\n    Note also that a language is distinct from a POSIX locale; a POSIX\n    locale identifies a set of cultural conventions, which may imply a\n    language (the POSIX or \"C\" locale of course do not), while a\n    language tag as described in RFC 1766 identifies only a language.\n\n\n    4.4.  Considerations for language negotiation\n\n    Protocols where users have text presented to them in response to\n    user actions MUST provide for support of multiple languages.\n\n    How this is done will vary between protocols; for instance, in\n    some cases, a negotiation where the client proposes a set of\n    languages and the server replies with one is appropriate; in other\n    cases, a server may choose to send multiple variants of a text and\n    let the client pick which one to display.\n\n    Negotiation is useful in the case where one side of the protocol\n    exchange is able to present text in multiple languages to the\n    other side, and the other side has a preference for one of these;\n    the most common example is the text part of error responses, or\n    Web pages that are available in multiple languages.\n\n    Negotiating a language should be regarded as a permanent\n    requirement of the protocol that will not go away at any time in\n    the future.\n\n    In many cases, it should be possible to include it as part of the\n    connection establishment, together with authentication and other\n    preferences negotiation.\n\n\n    4.5.  Default Language\n\n    When human-readable text must be presented in a context where the\n    sender has no knowledge of the recipient's language preferences\n    (such as login failures or E-mailed warnings, or prior to language\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Apr 98                    [Page 6]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                      Oct 97\n\n\n    negotiation), text SHOULD be presented in Default Language.\n\n    Default Language is assigned the tag \"i-default\" according to the\n    procedures of RFC 1766. It is not a specific language, but rather\n    identifies the condition where the language preferences of the\n    user cannot be established.\n\n    Messages in Default Language MUST be understandable by an English-\n    speaking person, since English is the language which, worldwide,\n    the greatest number of people will be able to get adequate help in\n    interpreting when working with computers.\n\n    Note that negotiating English is NOT the same as Default Language;\n    Default Language is an emergency measure in otherwise unmanageable\n    situations.\n    In many cases, using only English text is reasonable; in some\n    cases, the English text may be augumented by text in other\n    languages.\n\n\n    5.  Locale\n\n    The POSIX standard [POSIX] defines a concept called a \"locale\",\n    which includes a lot of information about collating order for\n    sorting, date format, currency format and so on.\n\n    In some cases, and especially with text where the user is expected\n    to do processing on the text, locale information may be usefully\n    attached to the text; this would identify the sender's opinion\n    about appropriate rules to follow when processing the document,\n    which the recipient may choose to agree with or ignore.\n\n    This document does not require the communication of locale\n    information on all text, but encourages its inclusion when\n    appropriate.\n\n    Note that language and character set information will often be\n    present as parts of a locale tag (such as no_NO.iso-8859-1; the\n    language is before the underscore and the character set is after\n    the dot); care must be taken to define precisely which\n    specification of character set and language applies to any one\n    text item.\n\n    The default locale is the \"POSIX\" locale.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvestrand                  Expires Apr 98                    [Page 7]\n\ndraft                       Charset policy                      Oct 97\n\n\n    6.  Documenting internationalization decisions\n\n    In documents that deal with internationalization issues at all, a\n    synopsis of the approaches chosen for internationalization SHOULD\n    be collected into a section called \"Internationalization\n    considerations\", and placed next to the Security Considerations\n    section.\n\n    This provides an easy reference for those who are looking for\n    advice on these issues when implementing the protocol.\n\n\n    7.  Security considerations\n\n    Apart from the fact that security warnings in a foreign language\n    may cause inappropriate behaviour from the user, and the fact that\n    multilingual systems usually have problems with consistency\n    between language variants, no security considerations relevant\n    have been identified.\n\n\n    8.

With its simple\n and efficient approach to special and modified characters, the Unicode\n Standard defines a new degree of data portability between platforms\n and across borders.  Software (especially modern, distributed systems)\n can be adapted for particular countries far more easily than when\n existing character sets are used.  The Unicode Standard is code-for-\n code identical to the International Standard ISO/IEC 10646.\n\n For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web\n site at <http://www.unicode.org> or e-mail <unicode-inc@unicode.org>.\n\n\n (R) 'Unicode' is a registered trademark of Unicode, Inc.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAny views expressed in this message are those of the individual  sender,\nexcept  where  the  sender  specifically  states them to be the views of\nReuters Ltd.\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It is actually the truth that I found a new\nmailbox that procmail handled and I had forgot...\n\nAnyway, I just have to state my view on what default language is, as I was\nforced to implement default language when working in the bi-lingual\nenvironment of Quebec in Canada. That was in the case of directory\nservices, but it is about the same thing as the email environment\ndiscussed here, as we used default language when the server was sending a\nsearch result back to the user, and the user had not specified the\nlanguage. We actually did send back alternative versions, each specified\nwith a correct language specification, but one alternative was the default\nlanguage.\n\nOn Mon, 20 Oct 1997, Martin J. D\u00fcrst wrote:\n\n> So you should probably say:\n\n>     Messages in Default Language MUST be understandable by an English-\n>     speaking person, since in this way, the greatest nuber of people\n>     worldwide will be able to get adequate help in interpreting the\n>     messages when working with computers.\n\n> Note that I also put in \"worldwide\" to make it clear that that's\n> what we care about, and not some local situation.\n> Also, I have put in a \"the messages\" to have an object for\n> \"interpreting\". Norvegian, or Harald in particular, seem to\n> like implicit references.\n\nA company in Quebec often have two names. One in English and one in\nFrench. One of these is the main name of the comany, the default, and it\nis often _NOT_ the english one.\n\nSo, for a company, the name of the company was defined like this:\n\n  English: Information Center\n   French: Centre Informatique (sorry if the example is misspelled/wrong)\n  Default: Information Center\n\nIn another case, it was the french name that was the default, i.e. which\nwas presented to non-english and non-french users. It was the _owner_ of\nthe record that made the descision of what was the default value.\n\nThis was a requirement from the Canadian government, i.e. that the default\nvalue can not be english, but instead any language, and it is the producer\nof the record that makes the descision of what it should be.\n\n\nNow, I remember very clearly what Harald told me when I told him this,\nthat the value is of no use for the receiver as he doesn't know what\nlanguage the value is in, but in the case of names of persons, companies\netc, it doesn't matter what language it is in, it is the main name of the\ncompany which then might have translations into other languages.\n\n\nSo, when talking about directory services, I clearly would like to be able\nto use the default language for a fallback value which the owner/producer\nof the record chooses what language it is.\n\n    Patrik\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

These\n\nnames are expressed in ANSI_X3.4-1968 which is commonly called\n\nUS-ASCII or simply ASCII.  The character set most commonly use in the\n\nInternet and used especially in protocol standards is US-ASCII, this\n\nis strongly encouraged.  The use of the name US-ASCII is also\n\nencouraged.\n\n\nThe character set names may be up to 40 characters taken from the\n\nprintable characters of US-ASCII.  However, no distinction is made\n\nbetween use of upper and lower case letters.\n\n\nThe MIBenum value is a unique value for use in MIBs to identify coded\n\ncharacter sets.\n\n\nThe value space for MIBenum values has been divided into three\n\nregions. The first region (3-999) consists of coded character sets\n\nthat have been standardized by some standard setting organization.\n\nThis region is intended for standards that do not have subset\n\nimplementations. The second region (1000-1999) is for the Unicode and\n\nISO/IEC 10646 coded character sets together with a specification of a\n\n(set of) sub-repetoires that may occur.  The third region (>1999) is\n\nintended for vendor specific coded character sets.\n\n\n        Assigned MIB enum Numbers\n\n        -------------------------\n\n        0               Reserved\n\n        1               Reserved\n\n        3-106           Set By Standards Organizations\n\n        1000-1010       Unicode / 10646\n\n        2000-2087       Vendor\n\n        2250-2258       Vendor\n\n\nThe aliases that start with \"cs\" have been added for use with the\n\nPrinter MIB (see RFC 1759) and contain the standard numbers along with\n\nsuggestive names in order to facilitate applications that want to\n\ndisplay the names in user interfaces.  The \"cs\" stands for character\n\nset and is provided for applications that need a lower case first\n\nletter but want to use mixed case thereafter that cannot contain any\n\nspecial characters, such as underbar (\"_\") and dash (\"-\").  If the\n\ncharacter set is from an ISO standard, its cs alias is the ISO\n\nstandard number or name.  If the character set is not from an ISO\n\nstandard, but is registered with ISO (ECMA is the current ISO\n\nRegistration Authority), the ISO Registry number is specified as\n\nISOnnn followed by letters suggestive of the name or standards number\n\nof the code set.  When a national or international standard is\n\nrevised, the year of revision is added to the cs alias of the new\n\ncharacter set entry in the IANA Registry in order to distinguish the\n\nrevised character set from the original character set.\n\n\n\nCharacter Set                                               Reference\n\n-------------                                               ---------\n\n\nName: ANSI_X3.4-1968                                   [RFC1345,KXS2]\n\nMIBenum: 3\n\nSource: ECMA registry\n\nAlias: iso-ir-6\n\nAlias: ANSI_X3.4-1986\n\nAlias: ISO_646.irv:1991\n\nAlias: ASCII\n\nAlias: ISO646-US\n\nAlias: US-ASCII (preferred MIME name)\n\nAlias: us\n\nAlias: IBM367\n\nAlias: cp367\n\nAlias: csASCII\n\n\nName: ISO-10646-UCS-2\n\nMIBenum: 1000\n\nSource: the 2-octet Basic Multilingual Plane, aka Unicode\n\n        this needs to specify network byte order: the standard\n\n        does not specify (it is a 16-bit integer space)\n\nAlias: csUnicode\n\n\nName: ISO-10646-UCS-4\n\nMIBenum: 1001\n\nSource: the full code space.

Some protocols may adopt a profile of MIME rather than \"100% pure\nMIME\" ;-), but that does not alter what the MIME standard says.\n\nThe MIME standard places specific requirements on text/* media types -- in\nparticular that a newline is represented with the octet pair \"0x0d 0x0a\"\nand that those octet values do not occur separately.  Also that no NUL\noctets appear.\n\nSo if you use UTF-16 with a text/* media type, then you're not using MIME.\n\nWe might eventually define a MIME \"widetext\" top-level media type for\nplaintext data using UTF-16 or UCS-4, but I don't think it's time to do\nthat yet.

I haven't given the MIME specs a good read lately, but they probably ha\nve\nsome more info.\n\nActually, the 4 points that you raise above should probably be in some RFC, no?\n It\nwould be a waste to leave them in this obscure mailing list archive.

There are lots of\nissues relating to canonicalization, whitespace, line-ending characters\nand other things in Unicode which make me very nervous from an\ninteroperability standpoint.  I think it's premature to start sending\naround UTF-16 because it takes all the Unicode-related problems and\ncompounds them by adding a slew of binary and endian-related problems\n(which have been known to cause trouble in the past).\n\nI believe everyone should use UTF-8 for now and once we've got the\nUnicode-related problems ironed out, then we can start worrying about the\nbinary, backwards-compatibility and endian-related problems UTF-16 will\ncause later. Ultimately, I want interoperable international characters to\nbecome reality, but the more potholes there are on the road today, the\nmore likely people are to turn away.\n\nThere are other things we could do when we deploy a widetext/* top-level\nmedia type.  We might want to also deploy a compressing\ncontent-transfer-encoding at the same time and prefer UCS-4 over UTF-16 --\nwe might even be able to skip the UTF-16 step altogether at least for\ntransmission over the Internet.  That would be one less interoperability\nproblem.  Unicode's \"Line Separator\" and \"Paragraph Separator\" codepoints\nmight just work, so in widetext/* we might want to mandate their use\ninstead of CRLF so we really have a canonical cross-platform plain text\nformat.  I have no idea if any of this will work and I don't think we have\nthe experience we need to do it right.\n\n> Make it so that\n> widetext/* in the HTTP MIME derivative is equivalent to text/*.

There is going to\nbe *a lot* of real world opposition to deploying ISO-10646/Unicode in\nemail.  I expect UTF-7 to be reviled as much as quoted-printable or RFC\n2047, and it was a mistake to promote it.  UTF-16 will be an unreadable\nblob to most email recipients; anyone sending it would rightfully be\nflamed.

A canonical form\nis a choice among equivalent forms, where transformation among the equivalents\nis allowed. Here are two choices that might be acceptable:\n\na)  treat widetext/etext as you treat application, for the purpose of\ndigital signatures: no transformations allowed.\n\nb) specify that the 'canonical form' of \"widetext/blah\" is the transformation\ninto \"text/blah;charset=utf-8\" with CRLF end-of-line.\n\nWhat do you think about a \"utf-16\" specific top level type, e.g.,\n\nutf-16/html  == text/html;charset=\"utf-16\"\nutf-16/plain == text/plain;charset=\"utf-16\"\n\nno charset parameter allowed.

We have to separate UTF-16 as a Coded\nCharacter Set and UTF-16 as a Character Encoding Scheme (For the definition\nof these words, see RFC2278 or RFC2130).

This led to a chain of events:\n* Both versions were generated, although one more than the other.\n* Some programs were released which only supported one of the endians\nbecause they only tested against programs generating one of the variants\nor assumed files would never be transferred from the other architecture.\n* As a result, interoperability problems occurred\n* Today many programs include an option to create \"PC-style\" or\n\"Mac-style\" TIFF images.  This confuses users to no end (although it's\nless confusing than trying to explain endian problems to users).\n\nMeanwhile, GIF, JFIF/JPG and PNG have no such problems.  They always work.\n\nThe cost of byte-swapping when saving a file is negligable compared to the\ncost of supporting two different formats and the interoperability problems\nwhich result.  Ditto for sending data over the network.\n\nUnfortunately, Unicode/ISO-10646 didn't consider these problems when they\ndefined UTF-16.  But with a historical record so clear on this issue, I\nthink we would be well justified in choosing not to repeat this mistake.\n\nWe should forbid use of little-endian UTF-16 in IETF protocols.  Otherwise\nwe risk giving the community which opposes Unicode some legitimate\nammunition to fight it.\n\n                - Chris\n\n                \n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

It\nseems very odd to me that a charset description make these kinds of\nrestrictions on any particular protocol.  How can we anticipate all uses of a\ncharset?  Isn't it for the protocol designers to make such decisions?\n\nIn general, I see a lot of problems with mandating the insertion of the BOM.\nWhat should happen if the document already begins with a BOM?  How does the\ninsertion interact with Content-Length?  With document authentification?  What\nshould trans-coding gateways do with the BOM?  Maybe we can think of things to\nsay about each of these issues, but should the charset definition really\nattempt to cover all of this?\n\nRather than mandating the BOM, would the following work - make the usual\nconservative-send/liberal-accept distinction, i.e., compliant UTF-16 producers\nmay only send in big-endian order, compliant UTF-16 consumers must be prepared\nto accept little-endian data, such content necessarily beginning with a BOM.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure that really deals with my devils-advocate questions above,\nthough.\nSigh.\n\n- John Burger\n  The MITRE Corporation\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

Charset Reviewer\n\n   When the two week period has passed and the registration proposer is\n   convinced that consensus has been achieved, the registration\n   application should be submitted to IANA and the charset reviewer. The\n   charset reviewer, who is appointed by the IETF Applications Area\n   Director(s), either approves the request for registration or rejects\n   it.  Rejection may occur because of significant objections raised on\n   the list or objections raised externally.  If the charset reviewer\n   considers the registration sufficiently important and controversial,\n   a last call for comments may be issued to the full IETF. The charset\n   reviewer may also recommend standards track processing (before or\n   after registration) when that appears appropriate and the level of\n   specification of the charset is adequate.\n\n   Decisions made by the reviewer must be posted to the ietf-charsets\n   mailing list within 14 days. Decisions made by the reviewer may be\n   appealed to the IESG.\n\nNote especially that:\n- it is the responsibility of the *REGISTRATION PROPOSER*\n  to forward the registration to me and IANA when he thinks that consensus is\n  achieved. Nothing happens by magic.\n\n- BOTH the registration proposer and the character set reviewer have to\n  agree that there is consensus before registration can happen.\n\nWRT outstanding registrations, my opinion at the moment is:\n\n- UTF-7 is noncontroversial. It needs to include\n  language that says it can be used as a MIME text/plain charset.\n\n- UTF-16 is controversial because of the BOM and byte-order issues.\n  I think consensus has not been achieved; the significant objections\n  are:\n\n  - While there is consensus that big-endian is preferred, there is\n    not consensus if little-endian is acceptable.\n  - While there is consensus that little-endian, if allowed, MUST\n    include the BOM, there is no consensus on where, if ever, a BOM\n    must be inserted in big-endian encoded text.\n  - There is no consensus that it is possible to write sensible rules\n    about using the BOM in protocols that carry multiple independent\n    pieces of text.\n\n  This registration will wait a bit yet.\n\nRegards,\n\n                 Harald T.

LANG would then appear as a parameter to MAIL FROM.\n\nThis solves the problem where an MTA is dealing with messages from widely\nvarying origins with different language preferences.\n\nThe tricky part is that adding such tags to messages in transit probably needs\nto be possible. Consider, for example, the case of a site with a large\ninstalled base of different user agents. By its nature the site has a strong\npreference for a particular language or set of languages. But the individual\nuser agents cannot be upgraded to add this information to the messages they\nsend. The site's server, however, can be. So the right solution is to have\nthe server add a LANG tag to every message coming from a local user that\ndoesn't already have one.\n\nThis all sounds simple enough, but it is also easy to see how such a facility\ncould be abused. The definition of such a facility needs to be flexible enough\nto allow certain forms of tag addition but not so flexible that it lets bad\nthings happen.\n\n> However, a LANG command is itself a complicated issue.

Your proposal would be a very elegant solution; and a\nsolution is badly needed.  Everybody recognizes this.\n\nUnfortunately, the layering violation is a show-stopper.  It would get vetoed\nby the email protocol guys; and if not by them by the IESG.  This is not the\nfirst time that this has happened to an elegant solution to a problem which\nurgently needs solving.  So don't feel bad!\n\nThis is ground that many of us have already covered.  Doing it in the RFC822\nheader constitutes an unacceptable layering violation; doing it as an SMTP\ncommand may cause the data to get lost along the way.  What we (this includes\nyou) need to do is see if there are any other alternatives besides these two.\n\nYou figured out the first level of the problem on your own, I've updated you\nto how far we've gotten on the second level, now let's see if we can come up\nwith any new insights for the third level.\n\n> The intent was to make a standard tag, and then apply it to the various\n> protocols, where the way it is done can be different. So, this draft was\n> not only for SMTP.\n\nThat's a good concept and it is worth salvaging, even if the exact mechanisms\nare discarded.\n\nYou may not have realized it, but you're creating a new concept.  It is not\nlike anything that currently exists, so it doesn't fit in with anything.\n\nThe new concept here is a \"tag\" that does not label its corresponding data;\nnor does it provide other information for the recipient of the data.  Instead,\nit provides control information for any new data that is to be returned to the\nsender of the original data.\n\nThere isn't anything like this.  It's done by protocol-specific commands right\nnow.  Perhaps the time has come to use this type of tagging\n\nIn you want to advance this concept, you need to build a framework for it in\nthe various protocols.  You can't use the existing frameworks, because your\nconcept doesn't fit with them.\n\n> Well, I don't think this is an issue in my draft: yes this problem is\n> difficult (technically speaking), but it has been discussed in RFC 1766,\n> which my draft is refering too.

RFC 1766 simply labels data; it does not apply user preferences.\nSo there's no need to worry about how the dialects interact.\n\n> Yeap you are right.  I had some ideas on this but I prefer to submit the\n> basic idea before going into details.  There is always place for newer\n> drafts and contributors! Would you contribute to this work?\n\nWell, at the very least I can help with \"reality checking\" (as in telling you\nwhat is likely to meet acceptance and what isn't).  I'm not yet convinced that\nthere is enough of an application for the concept, but time will tell; and it\nmight turn out to be the right thing.\n\nThe message I'm trying to convey is \"you have the correct basic ideas; and the\nconcept of using a tagging architecture is interesting but as presented it's a\nnon-starter.\"  So, get rid of the presentation (using an RFC 822 header to\nconvey SMTP instructions) and see if it can advance in a different form.\n\nI think that you should consider the question of being able to convey multiple\ntag/value sets within the same token.  It is, for example, extremely common to\nwant to establish language, locale, and possibly also culture at the same\ntime.  A tagging architecure can be a benefit over commands if it can do\nmultiple tasks at a time.\n\nYou need to expand on the idea of a tagging architecture for protocol\noperation control information, because you'll be building a new framework.\nThere are a number of people who've done this sort of thing before who can\nhelp you.  It'll help a lot to develop a *very* thick skin, because \"the\npioneers always end up with arrows in their backs.\"\n\nIn the case of this particular tag, you absolutely must detail how it\ninteracts with dialects.  As an implementor, I insist upon it.  Without a\nprecise specification to fall back on, implementors are left to guess, and\nthat leads to user confusion and anger.\n\nHere's what I think the behavior should be:\n1) If the user requests a \"generic\" form of the language, it will match either\n   a server's \"generic\" form or a dialect of the server's choosing.\n2) If the user requests a specific dialect of the language, it will match\n   either that dialect on the server or a generic form offered by the server,\n   but *NOT* any other dialect.\n\nExpressed as a table, we have the following (including a couple of surprises):\n\n                    What appears in the tag:\n                FR-CA,FR,EN     FR-CA,EN        FR-FR           FR\nServer has:     -----------     --------        -----           -----\nFR-CA,FR-FR,EN  FR-CA           FR-CA           FR-FR           FR-CA\nFR-CA,FR,EN     FR-CA           FR-CA           FR              FR\nFR-FR,FR,EN     FR              FR              FR-FR           FR\nFR-CA,EN        FR-CA           FR-CA           EN (!)          FR-CA\nFR-FR,EN        FR-FR           EN (!)          FR-FR           FR-FR\nFR,EN           FR              FR              FR              FR\nEN              EN              EN              i-default       i-default\n\nThe surprises, marked by \"(!)\", came about because the user requested a\ndialect that the server did not have, and the server did not offer a generic\nform.\n\nBut, although this is technically the most reasonable and flexible answer, it\nis not immediately obvious to anyone.  In fact, the behavior appears wrong at\nfirst glace.\n\nThat's why it has to be specified.  Or there will be user confusion and anger.\n\nIt also leads to the conclusion that servers SHOULD offer a generic form for\nall the languages it offers.  That would eliminate the two rows in which there\nare surprises.  Clients can also avoid the surprise by always requesting the\ngeneric form as well.\n\n> Can you point me on the drafts or proposals?\n\nFirst level required reading is RFC 2130.\n\nA typical example in the IMAP protocol is draft-gahrns-imap-language-00.txt.\nThis particular proposal has *NOT* been adopted in the IMAP world (nor has it\nbeen rejected); it's a good proposal, but it doesn't deal with the dialect\ninteractions and it doesn't deal with the inevitable question of locale.\n\nThe IMAP protocol should not specify the dialect interactions; it should defer\nto a higher standard and concentrate only on the IMAP syntax.  Unfortunately,\nthat higher standard does not exist.\n\nSimilarly, if there's a tagging type architecture for language and locale,\nIMAP should probably do something like have a \"OPERATIONTAGS\" command that can\ncarry arbitrary tags rather than a LANGUAGE command.  That'll address the\nlocale question.\n\n> I know this is not an easy solution, and yes my draft is not intended to be\n> the solution for all.  It is a proposal.

It becomes obvious if we\nsee something like \"FR-qc, FR, EN\" or \"FR-qc, EN, FR\".\n\nBut if we don't have an obvious intent, then we need non-ambiguous rules for\nits interpretation.  Otherwise, we will have many unhappy users.\n\nMy own belief is that \"FR-qc\" means *only* \"Quebec dialect of French\", and\nthat if the user's intent is \"Quebec dialect of French, then any dialect of\nFrench\" he must use \"FR-qc, FR\".  Similarly, \"EN-US, EN\" to prefer US English\nthan any English.\n\nThis is because we have, in some languages, cases where dialects are\nconsidered to be \"wrong\" to the point that a person would prefer a foreign\nlanguage than to receive the \"wrong\" dialect.\n\nBut, the important thing is not how this question is decided, but that there\nbe a decision that everyone adheres to.\n\n\nAnyway...\n\nThe bottom line is that draft-blanchet-preflang-00.txt is probably not going\nto be the method that is eventually adopted.  It omits some important details\n(such as exactly how the preference rules act) and it relies upon a vague use\nof \"headers\" which is not valid in most protocol concepts.\n\n***HOWEVER***, the concept of a client/server negotiated list of languages, in\nuser preferred order, is the right fundamental idea.  It is what several of us\nhave been working on for some time.

In general, the kind of of type/subtype operations\nyou described can only work when the \"default\" dialect can be assumed to be\nunderstood by any speaker of a non-default dialect (this has nothing to do\nwith i-default, hopefully).  This works for EN/EN-US/EN-UK and FR/FR-FR/FR-CA,\nbut not necessarily in general.  I think the Chinese dialects you mention are\nindeed going to be a problem, because they're not really simply =dialects=.\nPerhaps ISO 639  should be amended to include these as separate languages, and\nZH should be labeled \"Mandarin\", not \"Chinese\".  The real problem, of course,\nis that we're using the same set of codes for spoken =and= written languages,\nand the two do not always align.  I also think some creoles might be\nproblematic (I know ISO 639 has codes for various =groups= of creoles, but I'm\nnot sure how useful they are).\n\nGiven all of this, I'm starting to wonder whether specifying any subtyping\nbehavior on language tags is appropriate - perhaps client applications should\nsimply stick to listing the \"parent\" tags in addition to any subtypes, on a\nlanguage-by-language basis, i.e., if the user has only listed \"FR-CA\", they\ndon't get \"FR\" from the server, even if it has such an alternative.  I guess\nI'm saying that I'm not sure the table in one of your previous messages\ndefines appropriate behavior.\n\nAn alternative is for IETF to reserve the subtag \"default\", e.g., FR-default,\nand specify that dialects can drop down to this.  That way, the subtyping or\nfallback behavior can be controlled on a language-by-language basis.  This\nwon't force servers to include twice as many alternatives, of course: if the\n\"main\" language tag can drop down to the default, then the server need only\nmaintain the latter (default) version of the data, e.g., FR-default can match\nFR as well as FR-FR and FR-CA.\n\nIs this a viable solution?\n\n- John Burger\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

The second case\nisn't defined at all (that's what we're trying to do now!).\n\nWe are using the same syntax and registration for \"preferred language\" as is\nused for RFC 1766 \"language tags\".  But, the semantics of \"preferred language\"\nare not the same.\n\nIn \"language tags\", \"FR, DE\" means \"this content is in French *and* German.\"\nIn \"preferred language\", \"FR, DE\" means \"I prefer to get my text in French,\nfailing that, in German\" with an implicit fallthrough to i-default.\n\nThese are new semantics, and thus need a new definition.\n\n> As far as I can tell, there are no separate language codes for any of the\n> various Chinese dialects.\n\nWe should verify this.\n\nChinese dialects are not mutually intelligible; Mandarin and Cantonese are\nmore different than, say, Swedish and Norwegian or Spanish and Italian.\n\n> Perhaps ISO 639  should be amended to include these as separate languages,\n> and ZH should be labeled \"Mandarin\", not \"Chinese\".\n\nWe should assume that ISO specifications are out of our control and immutable;\nbut we should also make sure there's a problem to begin with.

That's why I don't think a\ngeneric solution based on language tag prefixes will work.  The problem is\nthat a \"simple\" language tag like \"FR\" does indeed indicate a dialect of some\nsort, despite the lack of a subtag.  For some languages, this \"main\" dialect\nis at least comprehensible to native speakers of all other dialects.  I don't\nthink we should assume this is true for all languages and dialects, however.\n\nMy suggestion for reserving the \"default\" subtag, and explicitly labeling\nalternatives with, say, \"FR-default\", is analogous to the ultimate fallback\nbeing discussed in another thread, \"i-default\".  Namely, messages in\n\"FR-default\" should be designed to be at least decodable by all speakers of\n\"FR-dd\", for any dialect dd of French.  This allows server implementors to\nwrite the \"FR\" alternative under the assumption that it will be read by native\nspeakers of whatever \"main\" dialect of the language the \"FR\" tag corresponds\nto.  Then, if nothing else is available, clients preferring \"FR-foo\" get the\n(decodable) \"FR-default\" version.\n\nYour approach seems to be to let \"FR-foo\" fall back to \"FR\".  My concern about\nthis is that information providers will not make the \"FR\" alternative\nnecessarily comprehensible in all dialects - they will assume that \"FR\" means\n\"French as she is spoken by inhabitants of France\" (i.e., \"FR-FR\"), not\n\"French comprehensible to any dialect speaker\".  \"FR-default\" would allow an\nexplicit distinction between the \"main\" dialect and a simplified form of the\nlanguage.\n\n- John Burger\n  MITRE\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

I've never\nadvocated that RFC 1766 be callously disregarded in defining the semantics for\nlanguage preferences; rather that these semantics are not defined by RFC 1766\nand should not be inferred by a reading of RFC 1766 that is outside of its\nscope.\n\nI'm not sure if the new document should replace 1766, or if it should augment\nit.

You will have significant, and ultimately\nunanswerable, controvery over what dialect is that \"main dialect\".\n\nFor example, an argument can be made that American English dialect is in some\nways truer to the English of Shakespeare than modern British English.  Such\narguments are best left to those academics and nationalists who enjoy such\nfrivolity.  We should not do so.  It is a waste of our time.\n\nWe should just stipulate that languages have dialects; that none are \"better\"\nor \"worse\" than others; and that, if a language is specified without\nindicating a dialect, this indicates that a form which is intelligible (or at\nleast decodable) by all speakers of that language regardless of dialect.\n\n> Your approach seems to be to let \"FR-foo\" fall back to \"FR\".\n\nActually, it isn't; that is just a possibility.\n\nI agree that automatic fallback is probably a bad idea.\n\nThe reason why I mentioned fallback is that users will expect fallback, and\nimplementors will find themselves obliged to provide it, unless there is an\nexplicit specification of the rules to make fallback unnecessary.\n\nWe should, by now, understand these rules, and the surprising consequences to\nusers if those rules are violated.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

As an implementor, I insist upon it.  Without a\n> precise specification to fall back on, implementors are left to guess, and\n> that leads to user confusion and anger.\n\nYes, very true. Here HTTP can provide quite a bit of help. Interestingly\nenough, it specifies exactly the same solution as Mark is proposing:\n\nMatch requested short tag (e.g. fr) against available long tag (fr-ca),\nbut not the other way round.\n\n> Here's what I think the behavior should be:\n> 1) If the user requests a \"generic\" form of the language, it will match eithe\nr\n>    a server's \"generic\" form or a dialect of the server's choosing.\n> 2) If the user requests a specific dialect of the language, it will match\n>    either that dialect on the server or a generic form offered by the server,\n>    but *NOT* any other dialect.\n\n\nThere are basically four possible solutions:\n\n(1) Only exact match\n\n(2) Match short request against long available\n\n(3) Match long request against short available\n\n(4) Match everything with the same prefix\n\nSolution (4) does not work because of cases such as x-, i-, and zh-;\nSolution (1) needs a lot of foresight from the side of the user,\nor a lot of restriction from the side of the data provider.\nSolution (3) has similar problems to (1). (2) seems to provide\nmost in terms of shortness of transfers and available matching\nfunctionality, while preserving the will of the user.\n\n\nBelow is the relevant text from the newest HTTP 1.1 draft:\n\n>>>>>>>>\n   14.4 Accept-Language\n\n       The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but\n       restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response\n       to the request.\n\n              Accept-Language = \"Accept-Language\" \":\"\n                                1#( language-range [ \";\" \"q\" \"=\" qvalue ] )\n\n              language-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( \"-\" 1*8ALPHA ) ) | \"*\" )\n       Each language-range MAY be given an associated quality value which\n       represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages\n       specified by that range. The quality value defaults to \"q=1\". For\n       example,\n\n              Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7\n       would mean: \"I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and other\n       types of English.\" A language-range matches a language-tag if it exactly\n       equals the tag, or if it exactly equals a prefix of the tag such that\n       the first tag character following the prefix is \"-\". The special range\n       \"*\", if present in the Accept-Language field, matches every tag not\n       matched by any other range present in the Accept-Language field.\n\n         Note: This use of a prefix matching rule does not imply that\n         language tags are assigned to languages in such a way that it is\n         always true that if a user understands a language with a certain\n         tag, then this user will also understand all languages with tags\n         for which this tag is a prefix. The prefix rule simply allows the\n         use of prefix tags if this is the case.\n\n       The language quality factor assigned to a language-tag by the Accept-\n       Language field is the quality value of the longest language-range in the\n       field that matches the language-tag. If no language-range in the field\n       matches the tag, the language quality factor assigned is 0. If no\n       Accept-Language header is present in the request, the server SHOULD\n       assume that all languages are equally acceptable. If an Accept-Language\n       header is present, then all languages which are assigned a quality\n       factor greater than 0 are acceptable.\n\n       It may be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send an\n       Accept-Language header with the complete linguistic preferences of the\n       user in every request. For a discussion of this issue, see section 15.6.\n\n         Note: As intelligibility is highly dependent on the individual\n         user, it is recommended that client applications make the choice of\n         linguistic preference available to the user. If the choice is not\n         made available, then the Accept-Language header field must not be\n         given in the request.\n\n         Note: When making the choice of linguistic preference available to\n         the user, implementors should take into account the fact that users\n         are not familiar with the details of language matching as described\n         above, and should provide appropriate guidance. As an example,\n         users may assume that on selecting \"en-gb\", they will be served any\n         kind of English document if British English is not available. A\n         user agent may suggest in such a case to add \"en\" to get the best\n         matching behaviour.\n<<<<<<<\n\nPlease also have a look at the last note. This is an UI issue, but one\nthat is not obvious to implementors or users. This helps to avoid\nthe \"surprise\" cases that Marc listed:\n\n\n> Expressed as a table, we have the following (including a couple of surprises)\n:\n\n>                   What appears in the tag:\n>                 FR-CA,FR,EN FR-CA,EN    FR-FR       FR\n> Server has:     ----------- --------    -----       -----\n> FR-CA,FR-FR,EN  FR-CA       FR-CA       FR-FR       FR-CA\n> FR-CA,FR,EN     FR-CA       FR-CA       FR          FR\n> FR-FR,FR,EN     FR          FR          FR-FR       FR\n> FR-CA,EN        FR-CA       FR-CA       EN (!)      FR-CA\n> FR-FR,EN        FR-FR       EN (!)      FR-FR       FR-FR\n> FR,EN           FR          FR          FR          FR\n> EN              EN          EN          i-default   i-default\n\n> The surprises, marked by \"(!)\", came about because the user requested a\n> dialect that the server did not have, and the server did not offer a generic\n> form.\n\n> But, although this is technically the most reasonable and flexible answer, it\n> is not immediately obvious to anyone.  In fact, the behavior appears wrong at\n> first glace.\n\n> That's why it has to be specified.  Or there will be user confusion and anger\n.\n\nExactly. HTTP already specifies it this way, and it would be nice if others\nwould follow. The \"q\" factors of HTTP are not needed; they are due to the\nfact that for HTTP, long documents for which a very varying quality of\ntranslation is assumed must be served. For error messages, it might be\nsafe to assume a relatively constant translation quality.\n\n\n> It also leads to the conclusion that servers SHOULD offer a generic form for\n> all the languages it offers.  That would eliminate the two rows in which ther\ne\n> are surprises.  Clients can also avoid the surprise by always requesting the\n> generic form as well.\n\nYes, these are the two solutions for avoiding surprises. Both work. Only\none is needed. It helps if the the spec says which one. Having clients\ntry to avoid surprises is slightly better, because it also handles cases\nwhere for some users, the general solution works, whereas for others,\nit doesn't. A typical case here is Chinese. zh-cn usually denotes\nsimplified script, and zh-tw denotes traditional script. For some\nreaders, it doesn't make much of a difference (although they prefer\none way over the other). Others are only used to one or the other\nvariant.\n\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

At this stage no technical change will ever be\nallowed. There will be a *2-month* letter ballot to ask voting national\nstandards bodies if the standard is suitable for publishing as an\ninternational standard by July 1998.\n\nSo if one wants to play maximum prudence, adoption will be undebatable by\nJuly. It is a formality and it is always possible that it does not make it\nbut given the count of votes now (81%), it has now gone beyond the 75%\napproval rate required for publishing an international standard. It would\nbe surprising to see that percentage go down, it never ceased to go up\nsince last July... that is however very theoretically possible, as unlikely\nas it might look.\n\nCEN is *urgently* asking for such a standard, for support of the EURO SIGN,\nand 17 countries voted in favour, 4 against and 1 abstention.

Contrarily to a standard, even if the\nstandard were not published (which is very hypothetical), nobody can oppose\na registration in the ISO character set registry.

ECMA held the SC2\nsecretariat until 1996-12-31 and also detained the ISO character set\nregistry. It gave it up and Switzerland also gave its P-membership status\nin ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2 up by the same occasion.\n\nThe new SC2 secretariat is held by ITSJ in Japan, and it has also become\nthe registration authority.\n\nFYI, the registry is going to be fully on the web in the next months,\nthey're not going to send the registry on paper anymore.

To allow this, the W3C I18N WG has as a first\nstep produced a requirements document. We would greatly welcome\nany kind of comments or feedback from the IETF community on the\nabovementionned document.\n\n\n\nRelated to this is PROPOSED DRAFT Unicode Technical Report #15,\nby Mark Davis (mark@unicode.org), on Unicode Composition.

HTTP 1.1 for a very rare case (warnings) allows\nMIME-encoded (the (in)famous =? ? ? ?= syntax) headers. Other protocols,\nin particular email, allow this, too.\n\nI don't think that we should worry about the general problem of what a\nhypotetical new protocol will do with its headers and other protocol\nelements. The correct way to design such a protocol is to take only\none, UCS-based, character encoding. The \"charset\" parameter and the\nMIME tag \"UTF-16\" then become irrelevant, even if the protocol should\nchoose to use UTF-16. It will be the protocol's business to make sure\nthey get around the big/little-endian issue, and we have to hope that\nthey do so based on past experience.\n\nI also don't think we should worry about UTF-16 being used raw in the\nheaders of traditional protocols. UTF-8 provides a much easier upgrade\npath for this case, and doesn't have endian problems.\n\nWhat I think we should worry is whether and how UTF-16 should be used\nin traditional protocol headers, based on MIME encoded words. Several\nsolutions are possible:\n\n- Discourage or disallow UTF-16 in such headers (there are other\n  cases, in particular Korean Email, where there are differences\n  between the encoding used in the header and in the body).\n\n- Use a different specification for these headers (headers would\n  probably be in big-endian without a BOM, and nothing else,\n  bodies could tolerate little-endian and/or recommend/mandate\n  the BOM). The difference is justified because headers need\n  additional encoding/decoding anyway, and the user expectations\n  for their legibility are somewhat lower.\n\n- Use exactly the same specifications for both headers and bodies.\n\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\n\n\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

I am a\nmember of the XML WG and was very much involved.  The XML WG is\nvery serious about I18N and does listen.  Unfortunately, Martin's\ncomment was away too late.\n\nMartin raised this issue out on 06 February 1998, which\nwas four days before the XML recommendation.\n\nThe voting was already closed.  The voting was unanimous.  The\ndirector already oked XML 1.0.  At that time, the remaining\nwork was supposed to be merely editorial.\n\nI recognized Martin's point.  I informed him of the URI of the\nlatest draft which was being revised.  I forwarded Martin's wording\nto the XML WG on 09 Feb.  But Martin's wording was debatable.  In\nan editorial F2F meeting, the editors of XML 1.0 and the chair\ndecided that it was too late to incorporate such a change.\n\nI can most certainly say that the XML WG did its best.  But to err is\nhuman.\n\nMaking the BOM optional is an upper-compatible change.  I believe\nthat the XML WG is open to such changes, after the registration of\nUTF-16 is made.\n\nCheers,\n\nMakoto\n\nFuji Xerox Information Systems\n\nTel: +81-44-812-7230   Fax: +81-44-812-7231\nE-mail: murata@apsdc.ksp.fujixerox.co.jp\n\n--Boundary (ID uEbHHWxWEwCKT9wM3evJ5w)\n     \n   \n\n"

As in:  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-scsu\n> If so, what will it be?\n\nMohamed Sadek <a-msadek@microsoft.com> replied:\n\n> Check ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets\n\nI did check there but the July 28 version still does not contain any\nMIME charset label for the SCSU character encoding scheme.\n\nThat's why I herewith kindly ask according to RFC 2278 to register the\ncharset label \"SCSU\"  (Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode) for\nReuters' character encoding scheme of the well-known coded character\nset Unicode (ISO 10646) as described in Unicode Technical Report 6\n<http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr6.html> of 1997-05-30 minus\nits errors and plus any future extensions.\n\nThe Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode is a stateful encoding\nwhich allows plain ISO-8859-1 text to pass through transparently and\nall other Unicode text to be stored and transmitted without any\nsignificant increase in size.  Beware that SCSU can encode the same\ntext in many different ways and that an SCSU byte stream can contain\nnull and 8bit bytes and such that look like ASCII or control\ncharacters but have a very different meaning.\n\nAttached is a decoder from SCSU to the UTF-8 transformation format\ndescribed in RFC 2279 that is much better suited for text processing.\nI have also prepared a small webpage at http://czyborra.com/scsu/ with\nhttp://czyborra.com/scsu/errata.mbox.gz listing the errors in TR6.\n\nCheers, Roman http://czyborra.com/\n\n/* http://czyborra.com/scsu/scsu.c written by Roman Czyborra@dds.nl\n * on Andrea's balcony in North Amsterdam on 1998-08-04\n *\n * This is a deflator to UTF-8 output for input compressed in SCSU,\n * the (Reuters) Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode as described\n * in http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr6.html\n *\n * Simply compile it with make scsu or cc -o scsu scsu.c and add\n *\n * text/plain;

The goal of network computing and understandable text\n   access across wide, diverse groups of people has brought great\n   momentum to computing environments that build Unicode into their\n   foundation.  Whether it's new internet commerce, network access to\n   data, or very portable applications, Unicode makes a solid foundation\n   for the network, global enterprises, and software users everywhere.\n\n   The Thirteenth International Unicode Conference will address topics\n   ranging from Unicode and fonts to Unicode-based multilingual Web\n   servers and databases.  Conference attendees will include managers,\n   software engineers, systems analysts, and product marketing personnel\n   responsible for the development of software supporting Unicode/\n   ISO-10646 as well as those involved in all aspects of the\n   globalization of software and the Internet.\n\n                            *  *  *  *  *\n\nUnicode(r) and the Unicode logo are registered trademarks of Unicode,\nInc.

Unless and until that is done everything we register appears to\nbe equal in stature.

            "content": "Much apologies to those who have seen this.\n\nI sent this request out twice on August 17 and 19 but I had not received\nmy copies back. Ned Freed said the mails were distributed and archived\nproperly and that I didn't see it because it was a bug on my mailer.\nApparently, there has been no discussion whatsoever on this request.\n\nUpon checking with Harald Alvestrand, he suggested me to resend it for the\nthird time so that the request complies withthe procedure outlined in RFC\n2278.\n\nRegards,\ntrin\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is a proposal to register TIS-620 as a charset with IANA.\n\nThis charset is to be used as a MIME text/* media type.\n\nBackground\n\n  TIS-620 is the standard Thai character set used in the Kingdom of\n  Thailand. The standard was issued by the Thai Industrial Standards\n  Institute (TISI), the Thai national standard body, in 1986 and re-issued\n  again in 1990 without changing code-point assignment. It has been in\n  widely use among Thai communities since then.\n\n  The standard was also registered under ISO 2375 by ECMA as ISO-IR-166.\n  Another attempt was made to register the same charset as ISO/IEC 8859\n  Part 11. However, this did not succeed because JTC1/SC2 decided that\n  charsets with non-spacing characters will be issued under a different\n  series rather than under the 8859.\n\n  TIS-620, indeed, specifies two code tables -- one is an eight-bit\n  extension to the ISO 646 (US-ASCII) standard, the other one is an\n  extension to the IBM EBCDIC standard.\n\n  This registration request is specifically made for the ISO 646 extension\n  table since this 8-bit charset has been used on the Internet during the\n  past six years without proper registration. This request does not cover\n  the EBCDIC version of TIS-620.\n\n  While there are several vendor extensions to TIS-620, e.g. CP-874,\n  MS-874/Windows-874, Mac Thai, etc., TIS-620 is still the most common\n  denominator and is used for data interchange to maintain full\n  compatibility among various platforms. Since these extensions are not\n  fully compatible with TIS-620, they are not covered by this request.\n\nRFC 2278 registration requirements conformance checklist:\n\n3.1 Required characteristics\n     x The proposed charset is a \"Coded Character Set\" per definition\n       described in sect 2.4 of RFC 2278.\n     x The proposed charset is intended for use in MIME content type\n       under the \"text\" top-level type and comforms to the restrictions\n       of the \"text\" top-level type in RFC 2045.\n     x The proposed charset is suitable for use in MIME.\n3.2 New charsets\n     x The proposed charset is NOT a new charset. It was first released by\n       the national standards body in Thailand, the Thai Industrial\n       Standards Institute (TISI), in 1986 and revised to the present form\n       in 1990. There is no change in code-point assignment between these\n       two versions.\n3.3 Naming requirements\n     x Proposed name for the charset is \"TIS-620\".\n     x The name conforms to the ABNF definition in sect 3.3 of RFC 2278.\n3.4 Functionality requirement\n     x The proposed charset functions as an actual charset.\n3.5 Usage and implementation requirements\n     x The proposed charset has been fully adopted by the market and\n       virtually every computer and software vendor doing business in\n       Thailand. It is currently the only charset used for thai\n       information interchange in the country.\n3.6 Publication requirements\n     x The proposed charset has been published by the Thai Industrial\n       Standards Institute, Ministry of Industry, Royal Thai Government\n       in 1990.\n     x An online copy of Thai version of the standard can be viewed at\n       <http://www.nectec.or.th/it-standards/std620/std620.htm>.\n     x Code-point assignments for the proposed charset can be viewed at\n       <http://www.inet.co.th/cyberclub/trin/thairef/tis-620.gif>\n     x An cross reference table between TIS-620 and ISO/IEC 10646-1\n       is available at\n       <http://www.inet.co.th/cyberclub/trin/thairef/tis620-iso10646.html>\n     x References to the Thai IT standards are published at\n       <http://www.nectec.or.th/it-standards/> while implementation notes\n       are available at <http://www.fedu.uec.ac.jp/ZzzThai/references.html>\n       and <http://thaigate.rd.nacsis.ac.jp/refer/index.html>.\n3.7 MIBenum requirements\n     x A MIBenum value for the proposed charset will be assigned by IANA\n       at the time of registration.\n\nCharset Name(s):\n\nTIS-620         This charset is to be used as a MIME text/* media type.\n\nPublished specification(s):\n\n[TIS_620-2533:1990] Thai Industrial Standards Institute, Ministry of\n  Industry, Royal Thai Government (1990).
