I was responding to Steve's points and meant\nthe locale that is used to influence the rendering of pages, applets,\netc.\nI don't think it some come from the O/S but from something that the user\ncan control. It can be set today by making a selection in a form and/or\nchoices of web pages as you indicated in another mail. That limits a\nuser's choices to the configurations an author provides. So there might\nbe an English page with date formats like d/m/y and another with m/d/y\nand another with y/m/d. But usually you are lucky to get a page with the\nlanguage and forget about date, number etc. formats. However, if this\nwas controlled by the user (perhaps through a style sheet) then there\nwould be far fewer combinations an author or publisher need provide.\n\nYou suggested in the other mail that we should recommend developers\ncreate locale-insensitive applets. It's good to recommend it, but it is\nnot always achievable.\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Regards,   Martin.\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

Organize a set of information in multiple ways for\nmultiple audiences and link into the techniques document for detail.\nOverlays are like a 'skin' and provide a user interface to the available\ndata.  One overlay could group HTML and CSS information together (while\npointing to separate documents).  Another could group WAI and I18N info\ntogether.\n\nDiscussion\n=========\nPossible approaches:\nAutomated: Database of pieces of information, accessed by queries which\nincluded just what applied to a given audience. May result in duplicated\ninformation. Or XML file with XSLT to access the right information. \nHand-crafted (\"pedestrian\") route: Flags in the document indicating what\naudience it's appropriate for. \nWe can start w/ WAI's style for the Techniques document and build on top\nof that. \nDecision: We'll start using the hand-crafted approach (not the automated\napproach).\nAction Item: Richard will start organizing what we've generated so far\nusing the WCAG techniques document format, so we can play with it and\nassess whether or not it's meeting our needs. Richard may also produce\nan overlay for it. WCAG headings model HTML spec headings. Overlay would\nprovide a different view.\nDecision: We agreed to start by concentrating on a single audience: HTML\nauthors.\nAction Item: All: Look at Richard's TOC and send in comments.\nDecision: CSS / HTML: Single document or separate documents? We agreed\nthey should be separate with an overlay to merge them together.\n\n\nNext meeting:\n==========\nSame time, same bridge, next week.\n\n\n\n"

We should check whether it's\nappropriate to have both as we develop content.\n\nIt would be good to have section about things you can do to enable\nauto-resizing and bidi mirroring (eg. Put radio buttons in a separate\ntable cell so that the dir tag automatically swaps them around).\nAction: Russ, write up some notes on suggestions for auto-resizing and\nbidi mirroring and send to list.\n\nWe should add section on normalisation issues to section 3.\n\nWe should spell out PUA on first use (and link to glossary).\n\nWe should say that fragment identifiers should not be translated.\n\nWe should consider when it is appopriate to discuss source separation. \n\nRe. data & time section: rules don't say what cases they apply to -\nshould say that for a  website intended to be read by wide audience\n(ie. International English) these rules apply.  For Japanese calendar, 4\ndigit numbers don't apply - tweak the rules: use qualifiers -  if you\nintend to translate / have parallel, want to address international\naudience\n\nWe should use lower case throughout for element and attribute names\n(like xhtml) (see eg META).\n\nWe should incoporate guidance in the Character Model and Unicode and\nMarkup Languages.\n\nWe shoud link to the WAI document when it talks about language\ndeclaration.\n\nWe should clarify the relationship between 'avoid escapes' and 'use hex\nescapes' techniques.\n\nMartin proposed to provide some ideas for dealing with character sets &\nencodings in forms, but we should move that to the beginning of the\nForms section.\nAction: Martin, provide ideas for dealing with character sets &\nencodings in forms.\n\nAction: All, think this week about areas you would like to work on, then\nsubmit ideas to the editors for incorporation.  Input sought: proposed\nheadings that reflect questions the audience may be asking; proposed\ntext for rules (synthesising the essence of the advice), ideas about to\naddress the description and ideas about links for resources.\n\n\nReview of progress on architectural approach\n=================================\n\nRichard is attending meetings of the new WAI Techniques task force.\nToday he discussed with them the work he has done on the i18n dtd, and\nthoughts about use of templates/overlays as a way forward.  WAI is\nlooking seriously at possibly basing their dtd on ours.\n\nRichard then reviewed the progress made on the dtd he created based on\nxmlspec over the weekend, and shared thoughts on some things still\nneeding to be done.  These include: much more thought about how to\nhandle resources (likely to come through experience as we develop\ncontent); more general markup such as ruby support and a common title\nattribute; creating a single file for all uri's that is then referenced\nby links in the text (reduces maintenance cost for uris that change);\nremove all the localizable information from the xsl; etc.\n\nOne of our key tasks is to identify what is the right level of chunking\nto optimise the reusability of the text.\n\nRichard presented the idea of using templates / overlays to structure\ninformation in the best way for the audience.  The current HTML file is\npurely a dump of the \"HTML database\".  Current thinking is that the\ncurrent XML file will be a bag of techniques that can be drawn on by the\ntemplates, which may pull information from more than one xml file.  Use\nof templates appears to offer a simple way of managing reordering and\nrepetition of information in the techniques, as well as template\nspecific data such as section intros.\n\nAgreed that we should keep exploring this way forward.\n\n\n\nNext meeting:\n==========\nSame time, same bridge, next week.\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ntel: +44 1753 480 292\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\n\n\n"

If so, does one exist, or\nshould I create one?\n \nThanks,\nSteve\n \nSteve Billings\nGlobal 360\nSoftware Internationalization & Localization\nhttp://www.global360.com/\n978-266-1604\n \n\n\n\n"

In other words, since\nCSS \ncan not be used alone to meet all of the success criteria it should not \nexist as a separate document.  It is fine for it to exist as a separate \nsource file but should not be used to generate a separate document.\n\ndiscussion:\n- if a person working on the css part of their work, they are likely to \nwant a css-specific document.\n-  are techniques documents means to conformance (like checklist)?\n- we can generate a checklist easy enough that will incorporate the\nvarious \ntechnologies that someone is using, but will we be generating entire \ntechniques documents?\n- would we end up with one long techniques document that contains \neverything?  technologies are intended to be used together.\n\npropose: log this issue in the requirements document. attempt to move on\nto \nget techniques requirements published.  won't know the answer until we\nget \nfurther along.\n\naction mc: log this as an issue in the techniques requirements\n\n===\nschema and templates\n\nrichard gave an overview of work on i18n templates.\nhe hopes to develop a variety of templates for a variety of audiences. \ncreate a shell to pull in info as needed.\n\nissue: create a template for every possible output? e.g., a template for\n\nhtml+css and another for svg+script.  then someone says, \"i want\nsvg+html+css\" how would they get that?\n\ndiscussion:\n- they would have to create it. or  perhaps write an xsl specific to\nthat \ndocument. to create these views, create an xml file with structure and\nxsl \nto extract the info at which point.\n- templates vs dynamic generation. i18n also planning for dynamic \ngeneration? not now b/c of complexity needed to generate \ndynamically.  relationships defined in template not in database.\n\npropose (for wcag): use templates for short-term since relationships in \ndatabase will be complex.  use work on templates to help define what \nrelationships need to be defined in database and how to define them.\n\n===\nediting process possibility:\n1. attach editors to different source documents\n2. submission process (form to generate xml and send to editors),\neditors \nadd to source\nthen multi-people not editing same thing at same time.\n\n===\naction: wac work on schema and tools (talk w/altova re: xmlspy authentic\n\nview of xmlspec+richard's extensions??)\naction: bc continue work on the checklist (prototype).\naction: mc revise techniques requirements\naction: mc and bf to review html techniques and begin submitting\nproposals \nto the list (for changes in content)\naction: all discuss new phrase to replace \"rules\" on thread on\nw3c-wai-gl\naction: mc look at templates\n\n===\ntomorrow: some of this will come up at tomorrow's wcag telecon\n\nnext week: report back on action items and discuss schema\nmilestone: next week we'll start to put in place for creating a document\n\n(although likely to be somewhat underway based on current action items)\n\n-- \nwendy a chisholm\nworld wide web consortium\nweb accessibility initiative\nhttp://www.w3.org/WAI/\n/-- \n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi,\n\nSome thoughts on the bidi space question-\n\n1) I see the CSS draft has picked up the drawings from our question. They use\nboxes with different borders (e.g. dotted) so they are distinguished by more\nthan color. We should probably do the same for accessibility reasons.\n\n2) At the end of their text they say:\n\n\"Note that there are two spaces between A and B, and none between B and C.\nThis is best avoided by using the natural bidirectionality of characters\ninstead of explicit embedding levels.\"\n\nCan someone explain this to me? I understand that neutral-directionality\ncharacters in between strong characters inherit their direction. However, with\ncss, direction is either ltr, rtl, or inherited. So if I have an element it\nwill have some direction. I don't have a way to say direction=none, or\n\"continue the direction of the elements on either side of me.\"\nSimply inserting a span into a string might change its direction explicitly or\naccording to its parent's direction.\nMaybe I misunderstand this?\n\n3) Just an aside, I think we need to tell the CSS folks to say that\nunicode-bidi has to be normal for their spec to be precise. We didn't need to\nsay it because we ruled out CSS from the question.\n\n4) With respect to embedding levels, the last part of the technical detail\nsection, the levels are right only if A, B, and C are characters of the same\ndirection as the element they are in. It's a reasonable assumption, but\nperhaps we should make it explicit. For example, if B were an LTR character,\nthe levels would be 12321.\nSome people may mistakenly believe that setting an elements direction somehow\nsets the direction of all of its contents rather than just the neutral\ncharacters.\n(Maybe that's a good suggestion for another question. \"Why does setting\ndirection only affect some characters?\")\n\ntex\n\n\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

You\ncan now see it at\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-international-multilingual.\nhtml (note that the extension is now .html rather than .htm)\n\nI have the following suggestions (use what you choose):\n\n[1]\nBackground, last sentence: in 'the design' you should probably leave out\nthe word 'the' or add something later\n\n[2]\nAnswer, para 2: 'Such sites' is slightly ambiguous - I think you mean\n'such regional sites'\n\n\n[3]\nAnswer, para 3: how about replacing 'a foreign word or phrase' with\n'embedded foreign text'?  It seems to me a bit of an edge case to call a\npage with a single foreign word in it multilingual.\n\n[4]\nAnswer, para 4: I think an important element of web site design that is\naffected by multilingual vs international is the approach to navigation\n- you may want to add this to the list in the first sentence.\nInternational sites typically navigate users through country/region\nselections plus language.  Multilingual sites may just involve language\nselection.\n\n[5]\nBy the way, para 1: since this is an English page, you might get\nslightly more impact by reversing the 1,547 and the 1.547 - this is not\nat all important though\n\n[6]\nFor me, one of the interesting differences between international vs\nmultilingual sites is their relationship to content.  Here are some\nthoughts which also include the question 'Which one should I be\ndeveloping?\" Perhaps this would be good for another question, or perhaps\nwe should make this question \"What is an 'international' or a\n'multilingual' web site, and which should I be developing?\" (you're\nwelcome to use any of this that you like):\n\n===============================================\n\nInternational sites may attempt to present the same monolingual content\nto an international audience.  This runs the risk of alienating\npotential readers or customers, either because they don't understand the\ninformation or because they don't feel comfortable with the cultural\napproach.  Such sites may use international English and remove\npotentially troublesome cultural references, but this can lead to\ncultural blandness. On the other hand, it is probably a relatively low\ncost approach.  Other international sites may remain monolingual, but\nattempt to vary content for the local reader, increasing impact and\nrelevance.  This is somewhat more costly and complex to manage, but may\npay dividends in terms of user responsiveness.  \n\nSites that provide multilingual content address understandability but\nnot necessarily cultural differences. Some multilingual sites are purely\na translation of the original web site.  This helps users understand\nmaterial better, but may still lack sufficient impact and relevance for\nthe local reader.  Translated sites may be appropriate for technically\noriented sites such as the W3C web site, but if your site, or a part of\nyour site, is attempting to persuade the reader to do or buy something\nthe ideal is to have multilingual sites that are adapted to the reader's\nlocal culture and interests.  This approach requires you to balance the\ndividends of impact against the costs and complexity of implementation.\n\nThe decision as to which of the above approaches you take will depends\non the type of material you are dealing with and your financial means\nand resources.  Simple technical material is often at one end of the\nspectrum, and marketing material at the other. Some approaches, though\ndesirable, may be simply too complex or costly to support your business\ncase.\n\n===========================================\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ntel: +44 1753 480 292\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Arko, Phil [mailto:phil.arko@scr.siemens.com] \n> Sent: 07 July 2003 17:06\n> To: 'ishida@w3.org'\n> Subject: this weeks q&a -- final HTML\n> \n> \n> The html document is attached for the \n> international/multiligual Q&A.

            "subject": "proposed question: which languages are RTL",
            "content": "Here is a start on this question-\n\nWhich languages are right-to-left (RTL)?\n\nBackground\n\nThis is a common question, although incorrectly phrased. Knowing\nwhich languages are right-to-left is important to web designers\nand authors, because the so called right-to-left languages are\nmore complicated to work with and the organization and\ndirectionality of the page layout are affected. Therefore, knowing the writing\ndirection can be relevant to estimating the work involved to create web pages\nin a new language.\n\nWhy is the question incorrectly phrased? There are 2 inaccuracies\nwithin this question. First, languages don't have a writing\ndirection, the script used to write them determines the\ndirection. For example, Yiddish is generally written in the\nHebrew script, which is right-to-left. But it can also be written\nusing the Latin script which is left-to-right.\n\nThe second inaccuracy concerns the use of the term \"right-to-\nleft\". Although the majority of the text will be written right-\nto-left, numbers are still written left-to-right (LTR). In\naddition, right-to-left text will often include borrowed or\nforeign words written in their native left-to-right script, and\nso the text is mixed directionality. The proper term therefore is\n\"bidirectional\". However, \"right-to-left\" is very commonly used,\nand as long as it is understood that a script with a \"right-to-left\" writing\ndirection is in fact bidirectional, the terms \"right-to-left\" and\n\"bidrectional\" can be used interchangeably.\nThere is more information on the different directionalities of\nscripts in:\nhttp://www.unicode.org/faq/middleeast.html\n\nAnswer\n\nLanguages generally do have a preferred script and\nwriting direction. The following scripts are bidirectional, and\ntherefore languages written in these scripts are also\nbidirectional: Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana\n\nThe following languages are generally written in bidirectional\nscripts:\n\nHebrew, Yiddish, Ladino,\nArabic, Farsi/Persian, Syriac, Avesta, K?k Turki, Manchu, Middle\nPersian, Mongolian, Sogdian, South Arabic, Uighur, Maldivian,\nUrdu, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik. Malay, Swahili, Hausa, Algerian\nTribal, old Malay, Baluchi, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Pashto, Landha,\nDargwa, Morrocan Arabic, Adighe, Ingush, Berber, Kurdish,\nJawi/Javanese.\n\nNote that this list, of necessity, is not complete. There are too\nmany languages in existence to identify them all here.\n\nNote that languages written in Latin, Slavic, Cyrillic, (Modern) Greek and\nThai scripts are left-to-right.\n\nIdeographic languages are more flexible in their writing\ndirection. They are generally written left-to-right, or\nvertically top-to-bottom (with the vertical lines perhaps\nproceeding from right to left). However, they may also,\noptionally, be written right-to-left. Chinese newspapers\nsometimes combine all of these writing directions on a page.\nFortunately for web designers and authors, in this case, the\ndirection is up to the designer.\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

One day.\nMeeting location: suggestions welcome !\n\n\n\nInfo share\n==============\nMartin found it very helpful to use the Q&A on Multilingual Forms (and\nits code snippet) to explain something to a colleague.\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-forms-utf-8.html\n\n\n\nFramework\n==========\n\nRichard spent all day today merging GEO and WAI DTDs.  There is now only\none DTD.  WAI are also beginning to look at developing different\ndocument views, building off the views that GEO has.  WAI had already\ndone some work on the DTD to build in the latest version of XMLSpec, so\nwe are already beginning to share development work in both directions.\n\nDTD documentation has been updated.  It is linked from the lower right\npart of the http://www.w3.org/International/geo page.\n\n\n\n\nOutreach \n=======================\n\nTopic: Article for LRC's Localisation Focus magasine \nACTION RI, send out note requesting article for LRC's Localisation Focus\nmagasine for people to consider contributing\nWe discussed an idea that presents each of the members of the WG with a\ncouple of paras about what we're interested in and what our motivations\nare, with a sidebar for info about the achievements of the group\n\n\nTopic: How to more widely publicise our Q&A work?\nAGREED: We will send an announcement to www-international each time we\npublish a new Q&A\nAGREED: We will set up an index page for Q&A's that solicits questions\nfrom readers, but makes no promises that we will develop answers.  On\nthe other hand, questions will be transferred to our question notepad\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/geo/upload/2003/questions/ - this should\nhelp us get some ideas about what people want to know.  The index page\nshould also invite people to participate in GEO and point to joining\ninstructions. \nAGREED: We won't develop the Q&As on the www-international list.  It's\nmore manageable to deal with a small group for this.  If we get a lot of\nfeedback after publication we can revisit this.\n\nACTION: Tex, to ping a couple of external list moderators to see if we\nshould announce there too.\nACTION: RI, ask Suzanne whether we can announce on her list.\n\n\nQ&A Review\n=========================\n\nPhil's Q&A\n-----------------------\nAgreed to publish this evening.\n\n\nRichard's build on Phil's Q&A\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSee point [6] at\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Jul/0010.html\nGroup thought this was a good candidate for a new Q&A\nNeed to find a short title question\nNeed to also break it up a little visually so it's not so intimidating,\nbut the text is quite polished (some felt it would be ok as is)\nSome discussion about making this part of a separate thematic article,\nbut decided to stick with Q&A for now - could use for other stuff too,\nlater\nAdd concerns related to user to last para\n\n\nRichard's new css vs markup for bidi Q&A\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup.html\nAgreed that this would be good to publish next week, since we don't have\nanything from Lloyd yet.\nSmall edits suggested.\n\n\n\nUpcoming assignments\n----------------------------------\nSend to group (latest)Agree to publish\nMartin: DONE 25 June\nRichard:DONE2 July\nTex/Phil:DONE9 July\nRichard:DONE16 July [css vs markup\nfor bidi]\nLloyd:11 Jul23 July [see his 5\nquestions]\nTex21 Jul31 July [what is bidi\nand which langs]\nAndrew28 Jul6 August\nMartin4 aug13 aug\nRichard11 aug20 aug [international vs\nmultilingual sites]\nTbd18 aug\nTbd25 aug\nTbd1 sept\nRuss8  sept17 sept\n\nNote:\nWe are likely to receive something from John Yunker\nWe are likely to receive something from Yves Savourel\n\n\n\n\nNext meeting:\n==========\nSame time, same bridge, next week.\n\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ntel: +44 1753 480 292\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/ \nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\n\n\n"

Examples include international\n   deadlines, international teleconferences, timestamps in DBs,...\n\n- For user interaction, it is often necessary to localize the time\n   representation to the local time zone of the user or of the event.\n   (the event e.g. for flight departure/arrival) Please note that\n   the time zones in these cases are not ISO8601/XML Schema fixed\n   offset time zones, but local 'politic' timezones with all the\n   dailight savings rules,... attached.\n\n- For some cases of business scheduling/calendering, the above\n   local ('politic') time zones have to be kept in the data\n   (e.g. if two people agree to have a business meeting at\n   2pm on May 5, 2003, in Chicago, and Illinois would suddenly\n   decide to change their daylight savings rules, then in terms\n   of UTC, that meeting would move.\n\n- Any other cases?\n\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\n\n\n"

But I have some concerns with \"dissolving\" locales into\n\"i18n context\" soup, as it were. The foremost is that most operating\nenvironments (the language the actual service is written in, as opposed to\nthe container) want a native locale object to enable those various settings.\nSo those items are \"subsettings\" of a locale object, and not necessarily a\nfull-fledged item themselves.\n\nI would put language as a sub-item of locale, but for the fact that there\nare existing systems that deal with language. The question is whether to\ncoexist, thus:\n\n  i18n context\n    - language\n    - locale\n        -language\n        -region etc.\n\nOr even:\n\n  language\n  i18n-context\n     - locale\n        - numberfmt, etc.\n\n>\n> >In traditional software, the developer doesn't need to\n> explicitly obtain a\n> >Locale object or setting in order to write internationalized code.

It also means that well-written code running on multi-locale\ncapable Web service containers gets multi-locale operation for free. This\nmay include a great deal of code that is merely well-written, not explicitly\ninternationalized. This is, to my mind, the best indicator \"we've done\nsomething right\".\n>\n>\n> >---\n> >Aside: These last two scenarios Deb described in an off-list email last\n> >week.

If\nthe specific setting transfer is not our goal, then whether we use a URN or\nan XML structure is merely syntax, as you say.\n\nHaving played with ULocale tags for the better part of a year, I have a\nbetter feel for where limited vs. open work than I did originally. ULocale\ntags are \"open-ended\" insofar as they allow an arbitrary number of\nadditional, optional, or vendor-defined fields. The problem is getting\nagreement on what those fields and their values mean. So, in practice, they\nare closed.\n\nWhat I've found is that there is a distinct set of \"values\" that have\nmeaning and may actually be necessary for total interoperability. These are:\n\n- language\n- region\n- charset (UNIX processes need it, can't get away from it)\n- collation\n- script (writing system, as with Trad and Simplified, or Japanese kana-only\nlocale)\n- orthography (as Bokmal/Nynorsk)\n- currency (euro?)\n- other variant (all one-time-events, e.g. EURO)\n\nThis historical problem with variant is that it is a catch-all field that\ndoes too many (different) things. In my own work, I've balled the last three\nup into \"variant\" and used script only on occasion. The remaining four\n(lang, region, charset, collation) maintain their importance to me, even in\nan all Unicode environment.\n\nFor me it's because I sometimes need to do Java->POSIX. Although, as Deb\npoints out, you probably wouldn't write an ML Web services container in\nXPG4-style C, you might use a Java container to invoke services or connect\nto resources (via JCA for example) that are written in such a style. Since\nthe service invocation may be within the context of a native interface exec\ncall, calling setlocale() on the service itself isn't quite the nasty\nproblem that it would otherwise be and a complete POSIX locale is needed to\ninvoke the service in a locale sensitive way.\n\nThat is, my Solaris box has a locale called \"ja_JP\" and it is quite\ndifferent than \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" or \"ja_JP.eucJP\" or even \"ja_JP@kana\". \"ja-JP\"\nisn't enough information to know which locale to initialize and I can't even\nenumerate the locales in some environments (like XPG4) to do it via\ninspection. A C program that is smart might try to guess its way through the\nlocales: this is like the plug-in idea that Deb suggested.\n\nIn any case, in modern programming this is less of an issue. But I still\nthink that the variations I've listed are important\nin diverse cases, too many to just ignore them.\n>\n> >I have use cases galore from webMethods that relate to the\n> various aspects\n> >of the above.\n>\n> Please send them in so that we can integrate them in our doc.\n\nAs I get to them.

Let's\nassume that as part of a session, the user retrieves different\nparts of a search result (the typical 1-20, 21-40,...). If\nthis doesn't use the same sort order throughout, then it may\nretrieve some things twice, and others may get lost.\n\n<DB> Agreed. It is the Web service requester's choice whether to vary\ninternationalization context within a so-called user session or not.\nTypically,\nthe internationalization context does not vary during the lifetime\nof a simple (which does not also act as Web service provider) Web service\nrequester. </DB>\n\n>4.

In the absence of inbound i18nContext,\nthe Web service component configured to execute as 'runAsCaller'\ncan effectively execute as 'runAsServer'.\n\nHowever, more sophisticated deployment policy can be suggested to\ndefine the 'default invocation internationalization context'. </DB>\n\n\n>All the management policies are to be enforced by Web service containers.\n>For container-managed instances, a Web service programmer should not able\n>to change the internationalization context programmatically.\n\nWhy not? Assume that the Web service interacts with a DB that\nis in a particular i18n context, then the Web service program\nhas to convert from the client context to the DB context.\n\n<DB> For enforcing the use of a disciplined programming model in\ncomponent based managed environments. For this particular example,\nprobably the service deployer can deploy the specific 'operation'(s)\nto execute under 'runAsSepcified'<DB's locale>. Programmatic\nalteration of middleware managed information in server-side components\nis not desirable; it can produce complex non-portable applications.\n\nTypically, if a complex server-side component (say C) needs programmatic\nalteration\nof i18nContext, it can be usually factored into two components C1 and C2.\nC1 is a simple component which is invoked by the service requester. C1\ninvokes C2, and C2 does all the interactions with DB.\nThe (almost) dummy component C1 can be deployed under\n'application-managed internationalization' policy allowing programmatic\nmanipulation of i18nContext, and C2 can be deployed to execute under\n'runAsCaller'.\n\nAgain, for unusual circumstances, one can always deploy his Web service\ncomponent under application-managed policy thereby having complete\nprogrammatic access to i18nContext. </DB>\n\n>In isolated\n>instances though, a Web service developer may want to exercise complete\n>programmatic control over the invocation internationalization context for\n>one or more components.

Here\nis some of the baseline information I'm working from.\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the XML declaration, the XHTML 1.0 spec says \"Such a\ndeclaration is required when the character encoding of the document is\nother than the default UTF-8 or UTF-16 and no encoding was determined by\na higher-level protocol.\"\n\nI am assuming that a 'higher-level protocol' includes the server sending\ncharset information in the http header.  But I am not clear whether this\nincludes any meta charset declaration. I assume that the meta statement\ndoes work in nearly all user agents for xhtml served as text/html.\n\nAnd later, when talking about HTML compatability...\n\n\"For compatibility with these types of legacy browsers, you may want to\navoid using processing instructions and XML declarations. Remember,\nhowever, that when the XML declaration is not included in a document,\nthe document can only use the default character encodings UTF-8 or\nUTF-16.\"\n\nThe two statements from the spec don't seem to be completely aligned -\nthe second is much more restrictive than the first because it doesn't\nmake allowances for non-utf-8 declarations in higher level protocols.\nI'm assuming that this is an error, and if I'm right, proposing that\nthis should be addressed as an erratum.\n\nI note in addition, it seems the accepted wisdom amongst content authors\nthat, because the xml declaration/prolog causes some browsers to fail to\ndisplay content and causes modern versions of IE to display in quirks\nmode, it is best omitted when serving xhtml content as text/html, - even\nwhen coding for web standards compliance.\n\nSee, eg http://www.webstandards.org/learn/reference/prolog_problems.html\n\nLater in the specification it says: \"In order to portably present\ndocuments with specific character encodings, the best approach is to\nensure that the web server provides the correct headers. If this is not\npossible, a document that wants to set its character encoding explicitly\nmust include both the XML declaration an encoding declaration and a meta\nhttp-equiv statement (e.g., <meta http-equiv=\"Content-type\"\ncontent=\"text/html; charset=EUC-JP\" />)\" \n\n\n\n\nIn GEO's guidelines\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/#ri20030218.131104811 we\nwant to point the way to better standards compliance and future-proof\napproaches for our readers, but also take into account the realities of\ncurrent authoring techniques so as not to alienate them. \n\nWhat I get from the above for people who want to serve non-ascii\ncharacters on a text/html xhtml1 page is:\n1.serve the charset information in the http header whenever\npossible\n2.if the browser cannot get the charset info from the http header\nyou must (and even if it can you probably should) (a) use both xml\ndeclaration and meta declaration, or (b) serve as utf-8/16\n3.if you don't want to use the xml declaration but can serve the\ncharset info in the http header you can use whatever encoding you like\n4.if you don't want to use the xml declaration and don't serve the\ncharset info in the http header you must only use utf-8/16\n\nI have a feeling that actually you could use the meta statement to get\naround 4, couldn't you?  \nI also suspect that you should still use the meta declaration for 3.\nIf you simply serve text without any http header or declaratory\ninformation, but as utf-8, I'm not sure all user agents will actually\nrecognise the encoding, will they?\n\n\nI'm currently inclined to simply recommend the following for\nxhtml1/html:\nA.serve the charset information in the http header whenever\npossible/practical\nB.for xhtml1 (served as text/html) use the xml declaration unless\nyou have a good reason not to (eg. To avoid quirks mode on IE)\nC.always use the meta charset declaration\n\n\nCould you please give us some pointers on the above to help us develop\nset of practical recommendations for the guidelines?\n\nThanks,\nRI\n\n\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ntel: +44 1753 480 292\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\n\n\n"

But I have some concerns with \"dissolving\" locales into\n\"i18n context\" soup, as it were. The foremost is that most operating\nenvironments (the language the actual service is written in, as opposed to\nthe container) want a native locale object to enable those various\nsettings.\nSo those items are \"subsettings\" of a locale object, and not necessarily a\nfull-fledged item themselves.\n\nI would put language as a sub-item of locale, but for the fact that there\nare existing systems that deal with language.

It also means that well-written code running on multi-locale\ncapable Web service containers gets multi-locale operation for free. This\nmay include a great deal of code that is merely well-written, not\nexplicitly\ninternationalized.

If\nthe specific setting transfer is not our goal, then whether we use a URN or\nan XML structure is merely syntax, as you say.\n\nHaving played with ULocale tags for the better part of a year, I have a\nbetter feel for where limited vs. open work than I did originally. ULocale\ntags are \"open-ended\" insofar as they allow an arbitrary number of\nadditional, optional, or vendor-defined fields. The problem is getting\nagreement on what those fields and their values mean. So, in practice, they\nare closed.\n\nWhat I've found is that there is a distinct set of \"values\" that have\nmeaning and may actually be necessary for total interoperability. These\nare:\n\n- language\n- region\n- charset (UNIX processes need it, can't get away from it)\n- collation\n- script (writing system, as with Trad and Simplified, or Japanese\nkana-only\nlocale)\n- orthography (as Bokmal/Nynorsk)\n- currency (euro?)\n- other variant (all one-time-events, e.g. EURO)\n\nThis historical problem with variant is that it is a catch-all field that\ndoes too many (different) things. In my own work, I've balled the last\nthree\nup into \"variant\" and used script only on occasion. The remaining four\n(lang, region, charset, collation) maintain their importance to me, even in\nan all Unicode environment.\n\nFor me it's because I sometimes need to do Java->POSIX. Although, as Deb\npoints out, you probably wouldn't write an ML Web services container in\nXPG4-style C, you might use a Java container to invoke services or connect\nto resources (via JCA for example) that are written in such a style. Since\nthe service invocation may be within the context of a native interface exec\ncall, calling setlocale() on the service itself isn't quite the nasty\nproblem that it would otherwise be and a complete POSIX locale is needed to\ninvoke the service in a locale sensitive way.\n\nThat is, my Solaris box has a locale called \"ja_JP\" and it is quite\ndifferent than \"ja_JP.UTF-8\" or \"ja_JP.eucJP\" or even \"ja_JP@kana\". \"ja-JP\"\nisn't enough information to know which locale to initialize and I can't\neven\nenumerate the locales in some environments (like XPG4) to do it via\ninspection. A C program that is smart might try to guess its way through\nthe\nlocales: this is like the plug-in idea that Deb suggested.\n\nIn any case, in modern programming this is less of an issue. But I still\nthink that the variations I've listed are important\nin diverse cases, too many to just ignore them.\n>\n> >I have use cases galore from webMethods that relate to the\n> various aspects\n> >of the above.\n>\n> Please send them in so that we can integrate them in our doc.\n\nAs I get to them.

The problem is deciding what to standardize and how to \nstandardize it. W3C's mission doesn't include maintaining registies.\n\nWhat we're really all talking about in this group right now is the need \nto decide what to standardize about locales and what the approach is. In \nmy opinion, we need to standardize locale negotiation, hence my interest \nin tags or \"simple structures\". I think it a difficult-if-not-impossible \ntask to standardize the actual data stores and detailed locale setting \nor preference exchange.\n\nFor the rest of this message I'm going to refer to tags and tagging, as \na synonym for \"tags or simple structures\", okay?\n\n> \n> The problems that Addison pointed out are indeed thorny, and all of us have\n> probably faced some of them while designing internationalized portable\n> applications .

In my experience, vendor specific \nextensions are useless in a heterogenous environment, but vendors \npersist in using them. Providing an extension mechanism allows an escape \nfrom objections.\n\nULocale is open-ended from that perspective. I made it open-ended to \naddress the specific concerns of Tex and others who felt that existing \nlocale identifiers were \"too restrictive\". I don't care so much about \nthe additional fields, except as a way of getting by objections... at \nleast at first I didn't. Later I found that I needed them to deal with \nvariants.\n\nDeciding to include or not include the \"optional\" fields as \"core\" (and \nwhich ones) should be a discussion that is held at some point. I think \nmy current list (far more than) exhausts my needs.\n\n From that point of view, it might even make sense to define:\n\na) the tagging standard with only its required fields plus the \nextenstion mechanism.\nb) specific extensions as separate \"add-on\" documents. For example, we \ncould define the \"currency\" keyword and map it to the ISO currency \ncodes. Or we could define the \"calendar\" keyword and provide a list of \npotential values. Implementers could choose to ignore these extensions.\n\nThis allows the project to be broken up into achievable pieces, while \nhelping eliminate objections.\n> \n> 2.

If you look at HTTP's use of RFC3066 \nor if you look at ULocale you'll see an exact definition of \"how to read \nthe tag\". What that tag \"means\" or is mapped to in a specific \nimplementation is not defined. That will have to be implementation \ndependent (hence your \"adapter\").\n\nI actually think it makes sense NOT to define the exact behavior of \nevery system. If we can just get the tags accepted/required, then \ni18n-aware companies (like, say, IBM) will exploit them and Visigoth \ncompanies will at least emit them correctly.\n\nNon-prescriptive conversion suggestions I think would be necessary. \nProbably sample implementation(s) would be needed at first too.\n> \n> Thanks,\n> \n> Deb\n> \n> \n>                                                                                                                                                     \n>                       \"Addison Phillips                                                                                                             \n>                       [wM]\"                    To:       \"Martin Duerst\" <duerst@w3.org>, <public-i18n-ws@w3.org>                                   \n>                       <aphillips@webmet        cc:       Debasish Banerjee/Rochester/IBM@IBMUS                                                      \n>                       hods.com>                Subject:  RE: [WSTF] My view...

Martin: will follow up with Russ Rolfe in case \n>MS has any space in Prague for an FTF. \n>This is a low priority item.\n>2. Team: write up and send to list a \"position\" \n>on the locale problem (See notes below for \n>what that means). Due prior to next meeting.\n\nThe following is my POV descriptions. \n\nMy view focuses on interoperability. If introducing RFC3066 style lang tag \nas it is to Web Services Locale model, a result of Web Services loses \nfunctional interoperability due to locale implementation differences of \nservice runtime environment. Introducing locale model for web services, we \nneed to consider a framework to keep i18n functional interoperability in \nheterogeneous Web Services operating environment. The following \ndescription is current my concerns about Language/Locale/i18n context \nmanagement. \n\n* * * * *\n\n1. Language and Locale\n\nProblem: Because the most of basic Locale naming rule is a pair of \nlanguage and region, Language is usually a part of Locale name. On the \nother hand, Language tag \"en-US\" means American English, and Locale \n\"en_US\" means language: English(US), and the country: United States. What \nis the difference between locale and language? \n\nMy view: Language is a part of Locale if they are mainly used for messages \nof user interface. However, if locale links other data processing such as \ncollation, data exchanging etc,  locale becomes different semantics from \nlanguage. For example, \"Invest $100,000\" is an en-US messages and it can \nbe generated from en_US locale sensitive functions such as Java \nNumberFormat, ResouceBundle and the default currency.\n \nOn the other hand, data \"$100,000\" is English message, but it may be, or \nnot related to default currency of en_US locale because currency is \nattributed to actual monetary data instead of locale, according to some \napplication scenarios. For example, when monetary data $100000.00 is sent \nfrom an account of a bank of US(en_US) to an account of bank of \nFrance(fr_FR), it must be $100000.00 as it is, or it is exchanged into \n???93773.45 by an exchange rate. An account user which prefers French \nculture wants to see the monetary data such as \"100 000,00$\" or \"93 \n773,45???\". An account user which prefers American culture wants to see the \nmonetary data such as \"$100,000.00\" or \"???93,773.45\". \n\nIn summary, \nen-US message\n\"Invest $100,000.00\" \n\"Invest ???93,773.45\"\nen_US default currency: $\n\n\nfr-FR message\n\"Invest 100 000,00$\"\n\"Invest 93 773,45???\"\nfr_FR(after 1999) default currency: ???\n\nThe most of existent locale model focuses on data formatting for UI, or \nsensitive functions in stand alone operating environment. It does not \nfocus on how to exchange data which is affected by locale, and how to \nprocess data in heterogenous distributed environment. \n\nThe important point is that Web Services is used for messaging, data \nprocessing and data exchanging in heterogenous distributed environment. \nThat's why we need to make the applicable Web Services area which are \naffected by Language/Locale negotiation clear.\n\n* * * * * \n\n2. Locale data differences by platforms\n\nProblem description: There is locale implementation differences usually. \nFor example, the following is the current date formatting result of ja_JP \nlocale. \n\nJava: 2003/01/15\nLinux: 2003???01???14???\nWindows: 2003/01/15\n\nThe following examples are usual locale sensitive messages using locale \nsensitive format.\n\nMessage examples\na) English \"Invest $100,000 on 1/15/2003\"\nb) Japanese(Java ja_JP locale) \"2003/01/15??????100,000????????????\" = \"Invest \n???100,000 on 2003/01/15\"\nc) Japanese(Linux ja_JP locale) \"2003???01???15?????????100,000????????????\" = \n\"Invest ???100,000 on 2003nen01gatsu14ka\"\n\nMy view: If the locale/i18n context is used for simple user interface, the \nlocale implementation differences is not so critical problem. User can \nadjust the differences. \n\nHowever, \n1) In heterogenous environment, both message b) and c) can be displayed on \nthe same interface, because Web Services can aggregate both messages using \nan user interface aggregation scenario. The data format differences is \nunsightly. \n\n2) If locale/i18n context is used for data processing, the locale \nimplementation differences become problem because the result is varied by \nlocale implementation environment. For example, if a requester requests a \nstring comparison in ja_JP locale, the result of Java based Web services \nis not the same as the result of Linux based Web Services. \n\nNeeds a mechanism to keep i18n consistency for service results. \n\n* * * * *\n\n3. Locale Identifier\n\nProblem: Locale naming rule is various. In homogeneous environment, locale \nname is equal to locale identifier. However, heterogenous environment such \nas Web Services, locale name is not equal to Locale identifier because \nnaming rule is differed by Web Services runtime environment. \n\nMy View: Needs an interoperable locale identification framework to \nidentify any locales in Web Services. \n\n* * * * *\n\n4. Categories of locale\n\nProblem: Locale categories are varied by requester/provider's runtime \nenvironment. \n\nLinux/POSIX/XPG: Collation, Character Classification, Datetime format, \nNumeric format, Currency format, YesNo Response format, Code set. \nJava: ISO 3 lang, ISO 3 country, Languages, Countries, Collation, Datetime \nformat, Numeric/Percent/Currency format. \nWindows XP NLS info: LCID, Locale name, Language, Code page, Number \nformat, Currency format, Datetime format, Calendar.\n\nAmong above environment, interoperable common locale categories are \nDatetime/Numeric/Currency data format only. Needs an interoperable locale \nrelated categories/functions for heterogeneous Web Services operating \nenvironment. \n\n* * * * *\n\nKentaroh Noji\n\n\n\n"

This might also include locale \"context management\" for Web \nservices, although we feel at this time that context management will \nlikely be standardized by the WSDL WG, WS-Choreography-WG, or externally \nby WS-I. In any case, we are now working on the requirements document \nfor locale negotiation, with hopes of having an early draft in the next \ntwo weeks and possibly publishing that draft in the next month.\n\nOne of the possibilities is that these recommendations will result in a \nspecific proposal or competing set of proposals for locale \"tags\". Our \ncharter as a TF currently only extends to developing requirements and \nnot to developing a recommendation ourselves. This adjustment will \nrequire, I'm given to understand, a trip back to the AC group for some \ncharter tinkering or it may be undertaken by another I18N-WG TF, such as \nCore, or another WG. In any case, I'm writing to inform you of this \nnot-yet-ripe, but distinctly possible turn of events.\n\nI'll keep you up to date as our work matures.

Possibly consider liasion.\n o Addison: Explore charter modification with Richard\n o Tex: create use case(s) for \"must match requested locale\"\n o Addison: create requirements document skeleton from ULocale document.\n o Deb/Addison: looking at new WS docs from other W3C WGs to ensure we're not missing anything\n\nGeneral discussion:\n\nMartin at WS meeting in Arizona. Any specific input would be helpful. Martin has 30 minutes tomorrow in joint session.\n\nMartin: Appreciated Deb's note on \"context\" keyword. Discussion of context mechanism for WSDL. Deb thinks this will be defined (competing  proposals exist). Exchange of contexts will be defined in WSDL and elsewhere. Need to fit our proposals into this mechanism as it matures.\n\nNote: WS-Choreography WG was started.\n\n--- no additional actions --- so we proceeded to discussion of locale/language negotiation:\n\no \"context\" definition across WS, not just for i18n.\no \"what\" instead of \"how\" should be the starting part. IOW> we should work on \"tags\", not the exchange mechanism because we think that the \"context\" idea will be standardized elsewhere. \no General agreement that locale should not be explicit most of the time. \no General agreement: passing locale explicitly is a poor choice for designing a WS. We agreed about the nature of passing locale and programming model.\no General agreement: locale interpretation is a problem due to disparate implementations (see Kentaroh's list)\n\n    --how much alignment/precision is desirable?\n    --\"tags\" might take several forms: \n          i) tag\n         ii) structure/data\n        iii) urn (as a pointer to a) datafile\n\n\nDiscussed what forms a good usage scenario: collation is a good example.. business rules a good example.. SQL statements with implicit ordering also important. Example: \"select all foo < ??\" (that's U+00F1, n-tilde)\n\nDiscussed reasons why \"charset\" might be useful or not. General agreement that we want to use Unicode everywhere and that charset is an XPG4 legacy value that might not have a place in WS locale negotiation.\n\n   counter examples: WS container invokes XPG4 program in new thread-of-execution; JCA connection to XPG4 resource\n\nTex: wants to eliminate ambiguity of existing locale system. Specifying a locale and using fallbacks may be problematic in some circumstances. Need something like a \"must match\" with default of false. Tex to create use case for this.\n\nDiscussed why fallbacks are prone to failure, some are \"sometimes wrong\", and sometimes best practices can work.\n\nDeb: suppose that no one does anything. We should compare scenarios in this area. Also: consider J2EE example of server-enforced locale.\n\nUltimately, we agreed on a \"Goldilock's approach\":\n   \"As closely defined as we can make the locale tags, but as open as possible.\"\n\nAgreed that our next steps are to find agreement on the requirements so that we can pursue standardization of a tagging scheme.\n\nIn particular we need to write requirements and *also* usage scenarios. What is the general case? What is the usage case?\n\nGroup: Considered if we should modify our charter now to allow us to create this as a W3C Recommendation. Discussion ensued. Planned to create requirements in the next two weeks. We think that this document will give us enough guidance to decide whether to pursue a specific charter mod or whether to put this item to I18N-WG-Core or to WS-Arch.\n\nDiscussed idea of having FTF in Feb/Mar timeframe separate from IUC and in Boston area.\n\nthanks,\n\nAddison\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: public-i18n-ws-request@w3.org\n> [mailto:public-i18n-ws-request@w3.org]On Behalf Of Addison Phillips [wM]\n> Sent: Monday, January 20, 2003 3:04 PM\n> To: public-i18n-ws@w3.org\n> Subject: [I18N-WSTF] [REMINDER] Teleconference Tomorrow\n> \n> \n> \n> W3C-I18N-WG Web Services TF teleconference [WSTF]\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> Bridge   : +1-617-761-6200 (Zakim) with conference code 4186 \n> (spells \"I18N\")\n> Duration : 60 minutes\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> Day      : Tuesday\n> Dates    : 14, 28 January\n> Start    : 23:00 GMT, 18:00 Eastern, 15:00 Pacific, 08:00 Tokyo \n> (next day!)\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> Zakim information    : http://www.w3.org/2002/01/UsingZakim\n> Zakim bridge monitor : http://www.w3.org/1998/12/bridge/Zakim.html\n> Zakim IRC bot        : http://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> \n> REMINDER: the next scheduled teleconference for the WSTF is \n> tomorrow.

Besides we have examples of those kinds of\nhard failures. The point of the automation of a large number of service\nrequests is that there is no opportunity for human or individual review.\nTo support automated operation and large numbers of requests, services\nneed to have the ability to report when they are being asked to do\nsomething they are incapable of and to error.\nIdeally, if I request a service to give me a map, and it can only give\nme one with Chinese names where I had indicated English required, I\nwould rather it failed the request, so that my process can consider\nalterantive services with English support.\n\nIf a request comes to my site to place an order to california, and my\nservice does not know how to calculate taxes for california it should\nnot go ahead and create the order.\n\n> >\n> >It would be better in this situation for a web service to return an\n> >error indicating that the locale is unknown or not provided for and to\n> >have the service request error.

(Although perhaps this is a solution not a\nrequirement?)\nThe requirement is that the service requestor be able to indicate on the\nrequest that the service specifically fail if it cannot match the locale\nrather than utilizing a fallback locale which may not be acceptable to\nthe requestor.\n\nI'll wait for a few more comments and then update the original text.\n\n> >This is of course an argument for an upfront negotiation of locale, but\n> >if there isn't a negotiation and agreement on locale behaviors, having\n> >the request fail when a locale is not supported is necessary for some\n> >services to be viable.\n> >It might also be the case that between the time of the negotiation and\n> >the execution of the actual request a locale might be removed.\n> >\n> ap> Current WS architecture makes \"negotiation\" very difficult. \n\nYes. I thought I should recognize the alternative, even if unlikely.\nThere is some element of negotiation in that the services can be\ndistinguished and enumerated by locale. (i.e. a separate service can be\nlisted for each locale obligating the requestor to choose the\nappropriate one or none.)\n\n\nThe WSDL\n> file indicates the way that the service is invoked.

It's a problem that \"locale\" is too broad and ambiguous. A policy\nstatement is clearly needed because we can contrive examples where a\ncertain language is required and the currency doesnt matter and others\nwhere the currency is important and the language doesn't matter. Simply\nsaying \"must match locales\" is meaningless, independent of the\nsuitability of values along the locale heirarchy.\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

A fault is generated during invocation that returns a faultReason that includes locale affected values.\n\n  a.. \"The date provided, 12 November 2201, was too late.\"\n\n  b.. \"The argument 12345.678 was too large.\"\n\n  c.. \"The argument 12345,678- was too small.\"\n\nHow does the provider perform the substitutions?\n\n</citation>\n\nI'll include a bit of a document here that we could discuss:\n\nIn general, error messages should be resolved as close to the user as possible. Why do we make that claim? An error might be generated in the bowels of a server module somewhere, where the end-user's language or other information about the user is not known. If the error text is composed at that point, it may be very difficult to eventually display it to the user in the user's language.\n\nIn the globalization architecture, the error is recorded at the error site with as much information as possible, in as language-neutral a format as possible. The actual production of the error text is delayed until enough information about the user (such as the user's language) is known, so that a correct translated error string can be looked up. For example, the error might record an error key, a date, and a quantity. At the point in the error processing where the user's language is known, the error key is used to look up localized error text. The variable information is inserted in the text in the appropriate place (this place must be localizable!) and is eventually presented to the user.\n\nExample: In Java this could look like:\n\n// at the error site\n\nthrow MyProgramException(\"Missing Records\", new Date(), recordCount);\n\n// at the UI\n\n...catch (MyProgramException exception) {\n\n    String message = userResources.getString(exception.getMessage());\n\n    String resolvedMessage = MessageFormat.format(message, exception.getArguments());\n\n    visibleErrorField.setText(resolvedMessage);\n\n}\n\nThe resolution of error messages need not take place on the client side. For example, a Web server can have the user's locale information at a high level and also have locale-specific error text. The resolution can take place in the server, resulting in the correct text in the Web page served to the end user. This also requires there to be some client-state information that the server can access, through an EJB or other mechanism.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that the very same error message can be formatted for different users in their own languages. It is in line with the principle of exchanging language-neutral data where possible, and formatting for the user as high in the process as feasible.\n\nThis has a bearing on the notion of locale that has been discussed on this list, as well.\n\nMark\n________\nmark.davis@jtcsv.com\nIBM, MS 50-2/B11, 5600 Cottle Rd, SJ CA 95193\n(408) 256-3148\nfax: (408) 256-0799\n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Tex Texin\" <tex@i18nguy.com>\nTo: \"Web Services\" <public-i18n-ws@w3.org>\nSent: Tuesday, January 28, 2003 11:45\nSubject: use case requiring failure if locale is not available\n\n\n> \n> Currently, if a requester specifies a locale and the service does not\n> know of or has no provision for that particular locale, you get some\n> default behaviors.

            "content": "Hi Mark,\n\nThere is a certain amount of elision in the notes, I'm afraid.\n\nBasically, the discussion revolved around the problem of passing locales \nto a WS: when should the WS designer need to deal with it (by specifying \nthe locale in the parameter list of the actual service or in the Message \ndefinition in the WSDL) and when not.\n\nPassing a locale explicitly is, as you note, a good idea when the locale \nhas a natural or reasonable place in the \"service contract\". But it is a \npoor choice when the service isn't necessarily locale affected (\"add two \ninteger values\"). Many if not most services fall into this latter \ncategory, IMO.\n\nThat isn't to say that there are no cases for passing a locale.\n\nIf one does a careful job of designing the data structures and service \ncontract, generally one does not want a locale. You may need explicit \nfacets of a locale (a language for natural language processing, a \ncurrency, a country code, etc. etc.), but not that many data structures \n  need an explicit locale, even as an override value.\n\nThere are lots of counter examples.\n\nSo that note should say something more like:\n\nIf you are making a WS out of an existing method or function call, it \nshouldn't be necessary to pass said method a locale unless the design of \nthe method (e.g. the parameter list) really calls for it.\n\nA lot more discussion (much of it off list, alas) goes with that, all of \nwhich fell under the rubric of \"agreed about the nature of passing etc...\"\n\nSorry the notes make this difficult to follow.\n\nAddison\n\nMark Davis wrote:\n>>o General agreement: passing locale explicitly is a poor choice for\n> \n> designing a WS.

            "content": "-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Lloyd Honomichl [mailto:lloyd@mail.honomichl.com] \nSent: 23 July 2003 00:47\nTo: ishida@w3.org\nSubject: A Q&A\n\n\n\nI'm away from home and my mail connection is fragile, but here it is.\nCan you \nforward it as needed?\n\nQuestion: \nWhat are the pitfalls of using the HTTP Accept Language header\nto \ndetermine the locale of the user?\n\nBackground:\nFor a number of perfectly valid reasons some web applications\nwould like to \nassociate a locale with each user that visits the site.  Some of\nthe information\nthis locale might ideally provide are:\n. What is the user's time zone?\n. What currency symbols and formats does the user\nexpect?\n. How should date's and time's be formatted?\n. Should measurements be metric (centimeters,\nkilometers, liters) or\nimperial (inches, miles, gallons)?\n. Does the user use letter/legal size paper, or A4\n. What shoe and clothing sizing systems should be used?\n. What is the user's physical location?\nSince none of these are included in the HTTP protocol many web\ndevelopers \nhave \nused the Accept-Language header to make inferences about the\nuser's locale.\n\nAnswer:\nUsing the Accept-Language header is a reasonable approach as\nlong as you \nknow its\nlimitations and give the user some way to override the\nassumptions you make.  \nAccept-language is ONLY intended for language use.  If you use\nAccept- Language\nexclusively, you may handcuff the user into a set of choices not\nto his liking.\n\nMany users never change the defaults for Accept-Language.  They\nare set \nwhen\nthe user agent is installed.  Unless they are multilingual or\nhave some other\nreason to adjust language preferences they may not even know\nsuch settings \nexist.\nHence, the user may not have ever ratified the Accept-Language\nsetting.\n\nA user agent may send a request that specifies only a language\nand not a \nregion, \nfor example you may not get a header with \"de_DE\", \"de_SW\" or\n\"de-AT\" to \nindicate\nGerman as spoken in Germany, Switzerland or Austria.  You might\nonly get \"de\" \nindicating \na preference for German.  If you were planning to use the region\nto decide what\ncurrency to use you are now in a bind.  Your particular\ncircumstances might \nallow\nyou to make assumptions such as \"Germany has 83 million people,\nSwitzerland \nhas 7 million\nbut only 63% speak German, Austria has 8 million, so this user\nprobably uses \nthe\nEuro.  If we're wrong we'll only offend 4.6% of our German\nspeaking customers \nor\njust over 4 million people.\"  Feel free to make such an\nassumption, if you can\naccept the risk.  Its a lot simpler to ask the user for more\ninformation.  Also,\nthe math gets lots harder for Spanish.\n\nPeople borrow machines from friends, they rent them from\ninternet cafes.  Do \nyou\nwant to shove Polish content at a user just because they are\nrunning a user \nagent\nin Warsaw?\n\nSome of the language selection mechanisms in Apache requires an\nexact \nmatch to\nthe Accept-Language header.  If a set of documents exists for\nfr_CA and fr_FR \nthen\na request for a document matching just \"fr\" may fail with a\nerror.  This may not \nbe a problem for your web site, but if they have to specify the\nregion for your \nweb\npage to work correctly, they may have problems with other web\nsites that expect\nonly language.  To satisfy both they'd have to configure their\nuser agent to send\nboth \"fr\" and \"fr_CA\".\n\nIn short: for a first contact using the Accept-Language to infer\nregional settings\nis a good starting point, but be sure to allow them to specify\ntheir cultural \nsettings\nmore exactly.  Store the results in database or a cookie for\nlater visits.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi Paul,\n\nThanks for de-lurking. Blech! Here I am defending something odious. ;-)\n\nNonetheless...\n\nI agree that Web services themselves will or should be entirely Unicode \nbased, since, at the very least, they do all of their data exchange via \nXML files and the majority of implementations deal only with UTF-8 as an \nencoding.\n\nHowever... my distinction here is pretty fine. It's between the concrete \nlocale implementation (the actual locale thingy or thingies) that you \nand Mark appear to be referring to and communicating preferences between \nsystems (the \"locale tag\" or the \"i18n context\", to use Deb's term)... \nthe question is: given a client and a server running on two different \noperating environments, how does the client communicate its \"i18n \ncontext\" to the server.\n\nThe easy case is to use RFC3066 style language plus region. But this is \nnot the edge case. The edge cases are generally the ones in which \nvariants come into play. Traditional locales have flaws in this regard. \nThis discussion of charset comes out of my enumeration of the different \n\"variations\" that various locale models use. Imagine that we send all of \nthe setting I enumerated in a \"locale tag\":\n\nlang = zh\nregion = CN\nscript = simplified\ncollation = binary\ncurrency = CNY\northography = standard?\ncharset = GBK\n\nOkay, so my Java program instantiates the locale \"zh-CN\"... was anyone \nhurt by this? The charset isn't actually a locale member in Java and has \nno meaning in Java. It might be used to affect a byte-oriented \ninteraction (probably in a very negative way).\n\nWhat about a POSIX system? It's running \"zh-CN.GBK@pinyin\". Does it hurt \nto omit some of that information when invoking remote Web services? What \nhappens if that invoked Web service is (a wrapper around) another POSIX \nprogram? Does the loss of information affect the outcome?\n\nI'm not sure, but it might if the collation is \"binary\" and the charset \nis changed from GBK to UTF-8.\n\nI'm not arguing that charset has a place in locales. Only that \npretending charset hasn't been associated with locales will make life \nslightly more difficult for certain platforms. That may not be a bad \nprice to pay. I don't, for example, think that charset should be \nexchanged by default. I see it as a potential optional element in an \ni18n-context exchange, because I don't really understand what the \nramifications of not having it are yet.\n\nThanks,\n\nAddison\n\nPaul Deuter wrote:\n> I agree - leave charset out of locale.\n> I have encountered difficult to diagnose bugs whose cause ended\n> up being locale sensitive code switching the encoding.

It might be used to affect a byte-oriented \ninteraction (probably in a very negative way).\n\nWhat about a POSIX system? It's running \"zh-CN.GBK@pinyin\". Does it hurt \nto omit some of that information when invoking remote Web services? What \nhappens if that invoked Web service is (a wrapper around) another POSIX \nprogram? Does the loss of information affect the outcome?\n\nI'm not sure, but it might if the collation is \"binary\" and the charset \nis changed from GBK to UTF-8.\n\nI'm not arguing that charset has a place in locales. Only that \npretending charset hasn't been associated with locales will make life \nslightly more difficult for certain platforms. That may not be a bad \nprice to pay. I don't, for example, think that charset should be \nexchanged by default. I see it as a potential optional element in an \ni18n-context exchange, because I don't really understand what the \nramifications of not having it are yet.\n\nThanks,\n\nAddison\n\nPaul Deuter wrote:\n> I agree - leave charset out of locale.\n> I have encountered difficult to diagnose bugs whose cause ended\n> up being locale sensitive code switching the encoding.

I think part of the problem is that we\nhave to be a bit more precise in our language (myself included).\n\nSomeone could mean by \"locale\" any of the following:\n\n1. \"locale conventions\" - a set of conventions for doing something (scope*\nunclear, but usually includes sorting order; breaks (\"character\", word,\nline, sentence); formatting dates, times, numbers, currency; etc.)\n*open issue: how far does this go? religious preference, aisle vs window,\nkosher vs vegetarian??\nhttp://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/locale_data_markup.htm\nl\n\n2. \"locale domain\" - set of people that commonly (though not always*) use\nthe same locale conventions\n*example: I use mostly US conventions, but use 2003-02-21 date format on my\ncomputer\n\n3. \"locale data\" - a set of data supporting operations in #2\n(e.g. \"January\")\n\n4. \"application locale data\" - a set of data used to support localized\nversions of a program.\n(e.g. \"Put the candle back\")\n\n5. \"locale ID\" - a short tag used for identifying a locale (one or more of\nthe above)\n...\nand perhaps more.\n\nThe names above are just off the top of my head. But spending a little time\nto come up with good, unambiguous terms for what we are discussing would be\ntime well spent!\n\nBack to the other topic:\n\n> If you are making a WS out of an existing method or function call, it\n> shouldn't be necessary to pass said method a locale unless the design of\n> the method (e.g. the parameter list) really calls for it.\n\nThis I agree with; an example would make it clear.

            "content": "There are fundamental problems in getting agreement on what a locale actually is.\n\nPersonally, I fall most closely into camp #1 on your list. Although I acknowledge the other items there are completely valid, I think there is some value for this group in taking a narrow view of what a locale is. My version of #1 is:\n\n\"A locale is a collection of settings related to regional or cultural preferences. As a collection, it is an abstraction of a specific \"cultural preferences\" or \"regional settings\" for use by computer systems, not meant as a perfect model of an individual's preferences. Locales provide software developers with the means of writing software that expresses itself in the most appropriate way for a given set of users.\"\n\nThus my preference for talking about \"locale tags\" or \"i18n context identifiers\" instead of \"locales\". Once we start down the path of closely defining a locale, we end up having to deal with the different locale models extant, the differing implementation details, dissatisfaction with the assumptions behind locales such as their lack of personalization, etc. Is this necessary to create internationalized Web services? I don't believe it is. \n\nIn fact, it might be counter-productive.\n\nAmong the models for Web services platforms is the \"pure WS environment\", in which developers directly author Web services for the purpose of being a Web service. It might be possible create and describe an \"Internet locale model\" that takes the full range of issues into account in this case.\n\nAnother model is the \"wrapper\" model, in which Web service provider products wrap existing business logic in Web services. In this case I think it would be best that they way you author a \"Web service\" be analogous if not identical to how you write \"regular\" logic. Or, another way: your regular logic will work as designed when you turn it into a WS.\n\nThus, by ignoring what the \"locale container\" actually \"contains\", I think we could create platform neutral \"locale and i18n preferences\" to enable multi-locale support. More importantly, I think we could sell the result to WS standardizers and implementers who don't care what a locale is (or isn't) and have a vested interest in their existing systems (and locales).\n\n~Addison\n\nNB> The foregoing is a personal view, not one currently endorsed by the WSTF.\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Mark Davis [mailto:mark.davis@jtcsv.com]\n> Sent: Friday, January 31, 2003 10:03 AM\n> To: Addison Phillips [wM]\n> Cc: public-i18n-ws@w3.org\n> Subject: Re: [I18N-WSTF] Teleconference Notes...\n> \n> \n> >Basically, the discussion revolved around the problem of passing locales\n> ...\n> >What we're talking about here aren't locales, though, but locale tags or\n> \n> By the bare word \"locale\", people can mean *many* different things, as you\n> did so in your two recent messages.

            "content": "Hello Mark,\n\nThe document lists usage scenarios, i.e. little 'stories' of what\none can do/what can happen. They are as concise or detailled as\nneeded to make a point, or show a case. We have started to add\nrecommendations, such as 'bad practice' or 'the way to do it'\nto some of them. I think you input could e.g. lead to two new\nones, one showing the bad way to do things, and the other one\nshowing a better way. Or we could merge the 'bad' one with a\nscenario that we already have.\n\nAs for the Java example you gave, I think I have two comments.\n1) It may be more difficult to pass complete error information\n    around in a Web context than in a local context. Much more\n    parties are involved, and many more things can go wrong.\n\n2) SOAP faults may indeed be a rather bad design, because they\n    punt on most problems by just offering some natural language\n    text. I think our usage cases where a bit too much oriented\n    towards showing the need for language negotiation, and not\n    enough thinking about the general design principles.\n    I have just spoken with somebody familiar with WSDL,\n    and there the situation seems to be better, but I guess we\n    have to check.\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\nAt 10:04 03/01/31 -0800, Mark Davis wrote:\n\n>I would be glad to modify the text I supplied, though I'm not sure of the\n>desired format.

There are 2 \n> inaccuracies within this question. First, languages don't \n> have a writing direction, the script used to write them \n> determines the direction. For example, Yiddish is generally \n> written in the Hebrew script, which is right-to-left. But it \n> can also be written using the Latin script which is left-to-right.\n> \n> The second inaccuracy concerns the use of the term \"right-to- \n> left\".

The proper term therefore is \"bidirectional\". \n\nI don't feel comfortable with the next bit...\n\n> However, \"right-to-left\" is very commonly used, and as long \n> as it is understood that a script with a \"right-to-left\" \n> writing direction is in fact bidirectional, the terms \n> \"right-to-left\" and \"bidrectional\" can be used \n> interchangeably. \n\nI don't think we need to lay it on people heavily, but I think they're\nbetter off learning to call it bidirectional rather than rtl.  If only\nso that they don't get corrected by script geeks at Unicode conferences,\nbut also because it reminds them constantly that enabling these scripts\nis not just mirroring.\n\nI think you should also introduce 'bidirectional's little brother,\n'bidi' at this point, too.\n \n\nI think it might be better to be more specific about what people will\ngain from following this link before they click on it. It may also be\nbetter to add it to a links section.  Also, I looked at this stuff and\nthought it wasn't tremendously helpful for beginners.  \n> There is more information on the different \n> directionalities of scripts in: \n> http://www.unicode.org/faq/middleeast.html\n\nYou could also point to sites such as \nhttp://www-3.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/bidi/index.jsp\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/Mideast.mspx\nEtc.\n\n> \n> Answer\n> \n> Languages \n> generally do have a preferred script and\n> writing direction. The following scripts are bidirectional, \n> and therefore languages written in these scripts are also\n> bidirectional: Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Thaana\n\nYou can't say \"languages ... have a preferred ... writing direction\" as\nyou pointed out earlier.  How about \"a preferred script with a given\nwriting direction\".\nI'd suggest you drop the first para, since you repeat the information\nimmediately below.\n\n> \n> The following languages are generally written in bidirectional\n> scripts:\n> \n> Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino,\n> Arabic, Farsi/Persian, Syriac, Avesta, K?k Turki, Manchu, \n> Middle Persian, Mongolian, Sogdian, South Arabic, Uighur, \n> Maldivian, Urdu, Kazakh, Uzbek, Tajik.

Formerly Malay was\nwritten with an Arabic-derived script called Jawi.\n-I'd suggest separating out historical scripts\n-I think it would be interesting and possibly germaine to provide\ninformation about the number of speakers of these languages (maybe a\ntotal) - its an impressive number - you can get such information from\nthe SIL ethnologue\n-what is Morrocan Arabic?

Until then, apprise your WGs,\nand anyone, else who uses the archives, that new messages stopped\narchiving during the morning of 8 July.  New messages will not be\narchived until the fixes are in place.  Previous archives won't be\naffected.\n\nThis should be a short-term problem, and it is expected that once the\nservice is restored all mail sent to the archives will appear as normal.\n\nThe WAI enhancements are expected to be deployed in early August.\n\n\n\nSimon\n\n\n\n-- \nSimon J.

Martin will host the telecon and keep notes.\n>\n>AGENDA\n>------\n>1. Review Action Items\n\nAddison contributed one more review of Arch Scenarios S003\nTex asked which WSDL document to review now that there are 3.\n     We recommended to start with http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl12/\n     Web Services Description Language (WSDL) Version 1.2 Part 1: Core Language\n\nThe question was raised whether there would be a Primer. I checked\nwith Philippe LeHegaret, staff contact of WSDL, and was told that\nthere would be a primer at a later stage, when the design had stabilized\nmore.\n\n\n>2. Discuss what the next step should be in getting the next revision of \n>the Usage Scenarios document created and released.\n\n     Discussion about what data should be in context, what should be in\n     profile, what should be metadata, and so on. May be depending on\n     application, but useful to have general guidelines.\n\n     Deb: from discussion with WS 'big guys', got feeling that\n          we need good use cases to make anything/anybody move\n\n     Martin: Usage scenario document is a bit more open ended than\n             a spec.\n\n     Deb: Our usage scenarios document is still somewhat unfinished\n          compared with similar documents.\n\n     Some discussion about how to move forward within current charter;\n     duration of group is for two years, but milestones are only set for\n     one year.\n\n     Some discussion about a potential next face-to-face, not conclusive.\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n>3. Discuss on-going review process of WS-Architecture Usage Scenarios.\n>4. Discuss review of WSDL 1.2 to ensure timely feedback on any issues.\n>5. Other business\n>\n>ACTION ITEMS\n>------------\n>- Tex: Post early WSDL review comments.\n>- Deb/Mike: Post rough WS-Choreography notes.\n>- All: Please review and contribute additional Scenarios\n>            (some progress: where are YOURS?)\n>- All: Please sign up for your 3-4 WS-Architecture scenarios\n>\n>\n>Addison P.

We want to do this ideally in the Fall. We get the most progress from FTF.\n     [] location?\n\n         Deb: Rochester MN, then Bay Area, then No.Virginia.  \n\n     [] Goal: Desire to make goal publishing \"final\" Usage Scenario document.

France)\n     [] WSWG joint meetings\n\n 3. Discuss Usage Scenario work\n     [] Deferred.\n\n\n 4. (added) discuss collation identifiers (Martin)\n     [] Discussion of on-going email thread at link Martin sent. Core TF reviewed XMLQuery/XPath specs. One contains a concept: collation. Lots of collation issues. Identifiers use URIs. Two groups are working on identifiers. Chris Newman (Sun) working on one (comparator registry at IANA/IETF).\n     [] Brief, non-detailed discussion of Mark's comments.\n     [] W3C-I18N-IG/Core TF: trying to organize a more complete response. \n\n     ** Action Items:\n\n        WSTF members are invited to get involved as appropriate. This is not a WSTF activity.\n        Andrea to forward links to Chris's items to IG and WSTF lists.\n\n 5. (added) Discussion of the term 'user profile' (Deb)\n     [] Deb: the design of a system may not be optimal with user profile. It may not be scalable; may present a SPOF.\n     [] Deb: Do we need to store unique ID? what about transitory events?\n     [] Addison: 'user profile' is given as an example of one way to handle out-of-band data or metadata. The best design may be something else. Our usage scenario document should be agnostic, but pointing out user profile as a possible mechanism is okay.\n     [] Addison: we need to describe the i18n issues in the core of Web Services, some of which present implementation decisions like this, but our focus should be on the WS issues.\n\n      ** Action Items:\n\n      Deb/Addison: Review current WSUSWD to ensure that references are sufficiently agnostic.\n\n> \n> Addison P.

Need to work up the scenarios some more to incorporate some of these items. Deb desires to have fairly generic examples. Also, provide examples of types other than currency (such as SI vs. customary measurement).\n\n=== New Working Draft review ===\n\nMartin> WD comments: Presented the new WSUSWD at www conference in Budapest. Well attended, seems to have been well received.  Two changes in presenation vs. explicit text in WD.\n\n  1. Services can have aspects of more than one pattern. (e.g. one pattern may apply to WSDL and another to SOAP etc.)\n  2. Addition of a \"data-driven\" pattern.\n\nDiscussion of Martin's proposed addition of the \"data driven\" pattern. \"Data driven\" is when the data sent to a service affects how the service executes. \n\nMaybe need a section on \"i18n problems with data structures\", since the framework is meant to apply to how the service executes. Data driven is an aspect of the implementation, but not necessarily an execution pattern. This section would also capture a lot of our extant and uncategorized scenarios.\n\nExample of a data-driven service that really fits the framework definition was proposed: a word tokenizer or word listing service would parse a string based on the language of the string, not necessarily the locale of the server or client. We think we therefore have a 4th pattern to enumerate.\n\nFurther comments: all present are okay with the direction of the document. AV still reading it.\n\nDeb> some reservations about the content. Wants to see more enumerated examples and policy.\n\n=== SOAP Feature Discussion ===\nAddison> Discussion of SOAP Feature and its relation to WSUS framework. Asked Martin to repeat his comments from editorial meeting:\n\nMartin> Hugo Haas: \"SOAP has Features, so we should be okay.\" / Martin: \"Yes, but HTTP has Headers.\"\n\nAddison> Would like to see SOAP Feature definition as a direction for the scenarios document to move in. Document can define policy or recommendations for users (informative), but ideally a SOAP Feature would be necessary for normative usage or interoperability.\n\nDeb> Want to be sure that work follows Web services policy document (MS, IBM, BEA, SAP). Deb to send link (when he finds it).\n\nDiscussion> Decided to continue to develop WSUSWD with eye towards informative examples.

            "subject": "A Few Possible Use case",
            "content": "Hi,\n\n(a) I am reposting essentially the same note that was posted earlier. I\njust\nadded a paragraph about Metric <--> English (?) conversion in use case (1),\nas\nsuggested by my colleague from Shanghai.\n\nI would like to have discussions about the 'application-level' (ref.\nAddison) use\ncases during our \"Tuesday Afternoon Teleconference\" (just trying to mimic\nlate Prof.\nDijkstra's famous \"Tuesday Afternoon Club\"). We can discuss the comments of\nDr. Davis and Addison, make the use cases closer to real life.\n\n(b) Here is one URL for the WS-Policy document:\nftp://www6.software.ibm.com/software/developer/library/ws-policy.pdf\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDeb\n\n\n\n======= O L D   N O T E ======================\n\nHi,\n\nHere are initial ideas for a few use cases dealing with eBusiness and\nbusiness choreography.\n\n1.  Assume the existence of an online store in some country (say Russia)\noffering various goods and services (Caviar, Vodka, Matruskas, Chess\nlessons, Science books, etc.). The base price of each good is in Russian\ncurrency: Rubles. For a non-Russian customer, not familiar with the Russian\ncurrency system, the price of the offered goods and services in Rubles may\nmake very little sense. For non-Russian customers, the online catalogue of\nthe retailer may intend to display prices in two currencies: the base price\nin Rubles, and an approximate price in the default currency derived from\nthe country code portion of the customer's locale. Thus an American user\nwill see prices both in US $ and Russian Rubles; a Japanese customer in\nJapanese Yen and Russian Rubles and so on. A Russian customer will of\ncourse see the prices only in Russian Rubles.\n\nThe system can use some local 'currency conversion' module (or even a\nremote 'currency conversion' web service) for converting Rubles into other\nforms of currencies. If a default currency can not be derived out of\n'caller's locale', the default base currency can always be used.\n\nNote that, the values displayed in customers default currencies are\napproximate and intended for user friendliness. During the actual business\ntransaction, when the buyer submits his credit card, the accurate currency\nconversion will be performed--most probably by some specialized Web\nservices interfacing with the financial institutions.\n\nJust like the case of user-friendly currency, the proposed online store\ncan also help a potential customer by performing \"metric --> English\"\nconversions\nwhen appropriate. A traditional American customer may want to see the\nweight of\nCaviar in ounces (not in grammes) or the volume of liquids in pints\n(not in liters). Based on the inbound locale, the online catalogue may\ndisplay the weight, volume, etc. in two systems: the base system (almost\nsure\nthat Russia follows the metric system) and the system usually associated\nwith locale (say the English system for the American customer).\n\n2.  Again assume the existence of an online retailer selling goods (say\nbooks). Assume a Japanese customer ordered a few books from the catalogue\nafter supplying his/her credit card details to the retailer. The online\nstore software after accepting the order will probably send asynchronous\nmessage(s) to it warehouses(s) requesting the actual shipment of the books.\nThe warehouse(s) after shipping the order will probably eMail the customer\nabout the shipping details: courier(s) used, the tracking number(s),\ndate(s) shipped, expected date(s) of arrival at customer address, etc. The\neMail is generated from a standard template and SHOULD be produced in the\ncustomer's locale (language). This requires the propagation of the inbound\ncaller's international context information in the asynchronous messages(s)\nfrom the eStore to warehouse(s). Since warehouse(s) typically require a few\ndays for actual shipment, the internationalization context should be stored\nalong with the order until the entire transaction gets completed. The eMail\nto the customer SHOULD also show the amount charged to his credit card\nformatted according to customer's locale and not in the locale of the\nwarehouse server.\n\nIn real life scenario, other intermediate eMails may get directed to the\ncustomer during the entire business transaction. One or more books may be\ntemporarily out of stock, partial shipment, etc. All these communications\nSHOULD originate from appropriate servers of the online retailing system in\nthe locale of the customer.\n\n3. Imagine a travel agency service providing complete travel assistance\nincluding airline reservation, car rental, hotel reservation, etc. Customer\nsubmits a travel itinerary and the travel agency fires three parallel\nprocesses to process airline, hotel and car rental reservations based on\nthe input itinerary. Imagine, two reservation tasks succeeded (say airlines\nand car rental) and the third one (the hotel reservation) failed. The\ntravel agency will now compensate the already reserved airlines and car\nrental bookings. As a part of the overall compensation, the travel agency\nsoftware informs the customer too. Sophisticated systems may suggest\nalternative itinerary to the customer. The material communicated to the\ncustomer may get generated from standard templates and SHOULD be in the\ncustomer's locale and not in the locale of the travel agency server. This\nrequires the storage of the inbound customer's internationalization context\nto be stored until the entire long running transaction (LRT) gets complete.\nThe stored internationalization context may get used in driving parts of\nthe compensation logic.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi Deb,\n\nThanks for sending this. Hmmm, I think these use cases don't really\ndemonstrate what you're trying to show.\n\nIt isn't a lack of realism that makes me unsure of these cases. It's just\nthat, given the mechanisms in SOAP/WSDL/etc., one can design these\napplications without resorting to a contextual mechanism. In fact, if I were\nto design any of these scenarios, I wouldn't want a context: I'd include the\nnecessary \"context\" in the user profile, a necessary precursor to any of\nthese applications, or in the data structures exchanged in the service\nsignature.\n\nFor example, the first scenario offers optional currency values. It would\nmake the most sense to define two optional inbound messages, one that takes\nno currency (for folks who want to see only RUR) and another that takes a\nlist of currencies (for folks who want to see the approximate values in EUR,\nCZK, USD, and so forth).\n\nA more general approach would be that descriptive fields may be culturally\nlinked. For example, a product that is \"seafoam green\" is likely to have a\nvery different name in, say, German. This is the sort of catalog information\nwhich is localizable and thus may be influenced by a language preference. In\nfact, in designing a catalog application I'd consider how the location of a\ncustomer would impact the information in other ways (like discount,\nshipping, taxation, packaging, product desc., regulatory reqs., etc.).\n\nIf the user must be \"random\" (unknown in advance) it is still necessary to\ngather as much of the \"contextual\" information >>explicitly<< as is required\nto serve the application's needs. This may include country, language, etc.\n\nI would look for cases where such a user profile is unnecessary to\nperforming the transaction (for example). Or for cases where the natural\nexecution of a service (or a simple process) wouldn't require the\ninternational context explicitly in the service signature, only implicitly.\nI think the cases in your email involve specific design time decisions, but\ndon't require a separate \"context\" (locale).\n\nThat's my first-blush thought. Let's talk about it next week at our next\nmeeting.\n\nAddison\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Here are my comments on this scenario:\n\nThis is the very simplest scenario possible. The SOAP Sender sends a \nmessage which is not acknowledged (either positively or negatively). As \na result, this scenario contains nothing involving internationalization \ndirectly.\n\nThe scenario as written contains one poor example of i18n: a \"price\" \nthat consists of a floating point numeric value and no currency:\n\n     <r:StockPriceUpdate xmlns:r=\"http://example.org/2001/06/quotes\">\n       <r:Symbol>BigCo</r:Symbol>\n       <r:Price>34.5</r:Price>\n     </r:StockPriceUpdate>\n\nThis pattern's usefulness would seem to be in servicing subscribers to \ninformation that changes periodically, as in the stock quote example. If \nI subscribe to a stock quote, I might get regularly scheduled updates or \nupdates when certain thresholds that I set are met. I can visualize \nsetting the settings using a Web site and then having, say, my cell \nphone sent SOAP documents containing the updates from time to time. A \n\"stock ticker\" application might use this mechanism as well.\n\nThe point of using this pattern is that the SOAP Sender doesn't want to \nreceive or process responses. If the recipient dies, goes on vacation, \nis off, has a problem and so forth, the server doesn't need to do \nanything. It just blindly keeps sending messages to the full list of \nsubscribers.\n\nThere could be internationalization ramifications to the use of such a \nservice. If text is sent, then the language of the text must be \nnegotiated out of band. Similarly, other contextual information must be \nused to provide formatting or specialized data handling affected by \ncultural conventions. The main point here is that the sending \napplication (and its designer) is solely responsible for the \nimplementation decisions here.\n\n---\n\nComments?\n\nAddison\n\n-- \nAddison P.

            "content": "Here are my comments on this scenario:\n\nThis scenario is very similar to the S001 scenario I just sent to the \nlist. In fact, all of my comments about that scenario apply to this one \nas well and I included some commentary about subscriptions in that other \none.\n\nIn this scenario, the same (identical) SOAP message is sent to multiple \nreceivers. The scenario suggests that multicasting is a possible option \nfor the transport layer as the only change.\n\nThere is an additional internationalization observation about this \nscenario though. In S001, each SOAP document is individually prepared \nfor delivery. In S002 the document is prepared once and sent multiple \ntimes. This means that user preferences such as language, calendar, sort \norder, and so forth must either not apply to the content or must result \nin separate sets of messages that are sent to a subset of the total \nrecipient list. This requires additional care when caching and preparing \nthe data and may require that the subscriber set be preprocessed into \n\"groups\" to ensure consistency.\n\nExtra effort should be expended in this case in trying to use the \n\"Language Neutral\" service pattern (see our Usage Scenarios document) \nfor the underlying service so that this additional effort doesn't apply.\n\n---\n\nComments?\n\nAddison\n\n-- \nAddison P.

As\na result, this scenario contains nothing involving internationalization\ndirectly.\n\nThe scenario as written contains one poor example of i18n: a \"price\"\nthat consists of a floating point numeric value and no currency:\n\n     <r:StockPriceUpdate xmlns:r=\"http://example.org/2001/06/quotes\">\n       <r:Symbol>BigCo</r:Symbol>\n       <r:Price>34.5</r:Price>\n     </r:StockPriceUpdate>\n\nThis pattern's usefulness would seem to be in servicing subscribers to\ninformation that changes periodically, as in the stock quote example. If\nI subscribe to a stock quote, I might get regularly scheduled updates or\nupdates when certain thresholds that I set are met. I can visualize\nsetting the settings using a Web site and then having, say, my cell\nphone sent SOAP documents containing the updates from time to time. A\n\"stock ticker\" application might use this mechanism as well.\n\nThe point of using this pattern is that the SOAP Sender doesn't want to\nreceive or process responses. If the recipient dies, goes on vacation,\nis off, has a problem and so forth, the server doesn't need to do\nanything. It just blindly keeps sending messages to the full list of\nsubscribers.\n\nThere could be internationalization ramifications to the use of such a\nservice. If text is sent, then the language of the text must be\nnegotiated out of band. Similarly, other contextual information must be\nused to provide formatting or specialized data handling affected by\ncultural conventions. The main point here is that the sending\napplication (and its designer) is solely responsible for the\nimplementation decisions here.\n\n---\n\nComments?\n\nAddison\n\n--\nAddison P.

There was an extended discussion of context and profiles in applications and how this relates to Web services. Basically, we discussed the difference between explicit context that must be exchanged in a SOAP message (e.g. in the body or in the header) and implicit context (\"profiles\") that are negotiated early and persisted through a transaction. An example of the latter is using a customer ID to retrieve complex information in the backing application rather than repeating the items in either the service signature or in the headers.\n\nMartin: P3P deals with some of these issues.\n\nSome discussion of good/bad ways to do context. Perhaps add examples to USWD to cover some of these and describe the different implications in Web services.\n\nDiscussion of WSDL vs. SOAP: how do SOAP Feature and WSDL \"feature\" relate? Intended as compatible mechanisms. It appears that both are not yet well formed because no one has essayed to create a SOAP Feature yet and thus there is no practice in WSDL features. This technology is not yet mature.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi,\n\nFollowing contains some rough ideas and thoughts about the use of\ninternationalization contexts (i18nContext = a chain of locales + a time\nzone) and their management policies (RunAsCaller, RunAsServer, and\nRunAsSpecified) in the contexts of \"Web Services Architecture Usage\nScenarios\" and \"Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios\"\ndocuments.\n\nI would like to receive your detailed comments. We can discuss and refine\nsome of the items over our next teleconference sessions. Maybe we can come\nup with some more use cases.\n\nThanks,\n\nDeb\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nA.  Web Services Architecture Usage Scenarios Document dated July 30, 2002\n(http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch-scenarios/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA.1  S001   In this so called 'Fire-and-forget Single Receiver' scenario,\nthe sender can conceivably send localized messages to the receiver under\ncertain circumstances. In fact, some may consider the stock quote currency\ncan be a localized entity. The example  presented in the document does not\nmention whether the price of the stock is 34.5$ or 34.5 DM.\n\nUnless the sender is aware of the receiver's locale preference, the sender\nwill transmit all the messages either in its default or some pre-configured\nlocale.\n\nQuestion: Can the sender be aware of the receiver's locale preferences\nthrough some sort of subscription metadata? To receive a fire-and-forget\nmessage, a receiver may have to subscribe to a fire-and-forget sender's\nservice. If the subscription information contains, receiver's i18n\npreferences, the sender can use that information to localize the\ntransmitted message in appropriate locale and time zone if necessary.\n\n\nA.2  S002   An extension of scenario S001. If 'multicast distribution\ntechnology' is used, the same message (probably localized in sender's\ndefault locale) will be received by all the receivers. However, if the\nsender uses a distribution list to 'generate and push' messages to all the\nsubscribed recipients, the proposed internationalization scheme mentioned\nin A.1 can probably be used: individual receiver may receive\nfire-and-forget messages localized according to its preferences. The sender\nmay apply some local caching strategy for optimization: it may generate a\nmessage only once for each locale.\n\nA.3  S003   An ideal case for utilizing i18nContext to maintain\nremote-local transparency. The response message can be a 'fault' too. The\nresponse message must not alter the execution environment of the sender: no\n'container breach' on reply/fault reception.\n\nA.4  S004   Same as A.3 when we focus only on internationalization.\n\nA.5  S006   All the faults (Reasons) should be localized using i18nContext.\n\nA.6  S007   All the partial responses should be localized under the\ni18nContext established during the initial request.\n\n<toDO> For a multi-threaded receiver processing many SOAP requests at the\nsame time, this use case needs careful investigation regarding the possible\nstorage and restoration of i18nContext (and other contexts as well) for\nincremental asynchronous response generation. </toDO>\n\nA.7  S010   Usually positive acknowledgements are locale insensitive in\nnature, though some may think that the time zone element of the i18nContext\ncan be used for time stamping the acknowledgement. Of course, if UTC time\nis mandated by the application semantics, the provider side may not have to\nuse the time zone information of the i18nContext.\n\nNegative acknowledgements can contain some sort of 'Reasons' consisting of\ntext messages. Any text message in an acknowledgement should be localized\naccording to the i18nContext.\n\nA.8  S030   The scenario can be an interesting application of i18nContext.\nThe third party intermediary contains business logic which are usually\nlocale neutral in nature. However, in theory, some business logic may be\nlocale (and time zone) sensitive in nature: string comparisons, price\ncomparison (must be done in the same currency), etc. To be safe, the\n'intermediary' and all the 'sellers' should be deployed as RunAsCaller.\n\nA.9  S031   The presented use case may not need any internationalization\nconsideration.\n\nA.10 S032   This caching can lead to extremely interesting applications of\ni18nContext for cached results which are locale and/or time zone sensitive\nin nature.\n\n(a) A simple but general strategy will be to deploy both the caching\nintermediary and the service provider as RunAsCaller. For the very first\ntime, the response corresponding a locale is computed at the service\nprovider, and later cached at the intermediary. The caching store can\nmaintain a table of locale-vs.-result, which continues to grow over time.\nOn a subsequent request the intermediary first looks at the caching store\nbefore forwarding the request to the service provider. If the caching store\ncontains the desired localized form of the result, the request does not\ntravel to the ultimate receiver.\n\nAlternatively, under certain circumstances where localization can be\nperformed at the caching intermediary the following approach can also be\nadopted.\n\n(b) The ultimate receiver (service provider) on receiving the initial SOAP\nrequest may provide a structured locale-neutral object to the caching\nintermediary. The caching intermediary stores the structured object in the\n'caching store'. The intermediary deployed as RunAsCaller can now create\nthe concrete response by invoking proper operations on the cached\nstructured object using the propagated i18nContext. The intermediary can\ncontinue to cache localized results in its local store and use them for\nsubsequent responses. For example, assume the first request is associated\nwith Japanese locale. The caching intermediary (1) receives and stores the\nlocale-neutral object from the ultimate receiver, (2) computes the response\nin Japanese locale, stores a representation of it in its local store, and\n(3) finally sends the SOAP response back to the initial sender (requester).\nIf a second request arrives with Korean locale, the caching intermediary\nfirst performs step (2) in Korean locale before embarking on step (3). Now\nif a subsequent request is associated again Japanese locale, the\nintermediary skips step (2); it simply retrieves the result of Japanese\ncomputation before completing step (3).\n\n\nA.11 S035   Probably i18nContext has no bearing in this case.\n\nA.12 S036   If the time stamps values are in UTC (which will probably be\nthe case), there is no need to access i18nContext.\n\nA.13 S037   Same as S032. The intermediary must check the expiration\ncriterion.\n\nA.14 S040   Probably the most complex usage scenario regarding\ninternationalization. Need detailed investigation especially regarding\ncompensation spheres and compensating transactions. Interesting\nlocalization may have to performed during compensation.\n\n<toDo> Need to study the BPEL4WS spec. in detail and produce a few use\ncases especially regarding 'container breach', context storage, context\nretrieval, context switching, and of course compensation. </toDo>\n\nA.15 S061   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.16 S062   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.17 S0621  Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.18 S063   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.19 S064   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.20 S065   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.21 S070   Another ideal scenario for i18nContext. The case is similar\nA.3.\n\nA.22 S071   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.23 S080   Internationalization and transaction are orthogonal to each\nother. See A.14 for long running transactions.\n\nA.24 S090   Should i18nContext be used to interpret non-XML attachments?\n\nA.25 S091   Similar to A.3 in principle. For consistent semantics and\nsimpler programming model the inbound i18nContext must remain the same in\nall inbound message fragments. Should the SOAP receiver raise a fault in\ncase it detects a change in inbound i18nContext during incremental\nreception and processing?\n\nA.26 S092   Probably internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.27 S200   If the event subscription process includes receivers\ninternationalization preferences, the case is similar to that of A.2.\n\nA.28 S201         Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.29 S300   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.30 S500   See A.32.\n\nA.31 S501   See A.32.\n\nA.32 S502   Service/operation level attributes/metadata should include the\ninternationalization context management policies (RunAsCaller, etc.).  The\npolicies should be available in UDDI (or similar registries). A Web service\nrequester should be able to inspect the i18nContext management policies\nbefore choosing a Web service provider.  The default internationalization\npolicy, if explicitly stated, determining the invocation\ninternationalization context in the absence of an inbound i18nContext, may\nalso appear in UDDI.\n\n<toDo> We need to precisely formulate the i18nContext management policies\n(and other related stuff) and their accessors in the domain of UDDI (and\nWSDL?). </toDo>\n\nA.33 S503   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.34 S504   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n\nA.35 S505   The description of the use case is rather vague. Not sure\nwhether and how the envisioned 'automatic dynamic resolver' may use the\ninternationalization capabilities (RunAsCaller, RunAsServer,\nRunAsSpecified) before selecting specific Web service operations to invoke.\n\nA.36 S510   Internationalization is definitely a QoS. The support for this\nparticular QoS should be available explicitly in UDDI.\n\nTex's concern (see the last two lines of Section 2.36.2): Suppose a Web\nservice operation OP is advertised to execute under RunAsCaller i18nContext\nmanagement policy. Assume a particular invocation of the operation is\nassociated with xx_YY inbound locale, and the Web service provider do not\nhave resources to localize computations under the requested xx_YY locale.\nWhat should be the behaviour of OP? Will it raise a fault or use some\ndefault locale?\n\nDepending on the importance of the computation performed by OP, any one of\nthe above mentioned two strategies may be used.\n\n   If the requester can tolerate locale substitution (default locale for\n   xx_YY), OP can use the default locale.\n   If the requester must receive the result in the requested locale, OP can\n   raise an appropriate fault with the 'Reason' in the default locale?\n\nThe behaviour of Web service operations deployed as RunAsCaller in case the\nrequested locale can not be honoured should be specifiable externally at\nthe deployment time. This particular deployment attribute should also be\navailable at an appropriate place in the UDDI registry.\n\n<toDO> Need to work on exact formalization. </toDO>\n\nA.37 S600   Not sure about the term 'WSD definition'. If it refers to\ninterface and similar stuff, internationalization is not an issue. However\nelements like 'wsil:abstract' may be localized in various languages for\nhuman interpretation. The inbound i18nContext can profitably be used in\nthis scenario to receive localized versions of elements like\n'wsil:abstract'.\n\nA.38 S601   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n=========================================================\n\n\nB.  Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenario, dated February 18,\n2003 (http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB.1  S-003  In case we have both i18nContext as a SOAP header and also the\n'Accept-Language' HTTP header which one shall be honoured by the service\nprovider? Shall we stipulate: first i18nContext in the SOAP header and in\nits absence the 'Accept-Language' header? After all we want to define the\ninternationalization semantics of Web services independent of the carrier\nprotocol (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).\n\nAlso, why 'xml:lang' in SOAP fault and in general in SOAP responses? The\n'Reason' can contain region dependent stuff too.  Can we envision a more\ngeneral tag something like 'xml:locale'?\n\nB.2  S-004  Clearly the suggested solution is impractical; in real life\nenterprise environments, it may not be possible to generate and transmit a\n'fault' containing 'Reason' in all available languages. This is an ideal\ncase for the use of i18nContext. The service provider's invocation\ni18nContext should be used to generate the localized fault.\n\nIn this context, it should be mentioned that the specification of 'fault'\nin the SOAP 1.2 specification is rather weak and incomplete.\n\n(a) Unlike the exception models of the modern programming environments like\nJava or C#, SOAP faults can not be nested.  The ability to nest faults\nallows the application developers to maintain clear separation between\napplication-level fault details from low-level (say data access) fault\ndetails without loosing any valuable diagnostic information. SOAP 1.x\nshould carefully consider the issue of defining nested/chained faults.\n\n(b) In a hop-by-hop SOAP processing model, the use of simple texts as a\nfault 'Reason' is inadequate for the purpose of distributed\ninternationalization. The reverse chained nodes can all be configured under\ndifferent locales.\n\nEven in a simple two node request-response SOAP scenario, some may consider\nthe existing definition of SOAP fault to be inadequate. A Web service\nprovider may log certain category of faults locally before transmission.\nSuppose a language negotiation mechanism as mentioned in the SOAP V1.2\nprimer, Dec. 19, 2002 (Section 2.3) exists between a SOAP requester and\nservice provider. Assume a fault is produced at an American server for\nprocessing a request from a Japanese requester. Using the language\nnegotiation mechanism, the service provider can generate the fault in\nJapanese language. If the Japanese language faults are logged at the\nAmerican server, the English speaking system administrator may have tough\ntime in interpreting the system log. Probably SOAP faults should be defined\nto optionally contain a structured locale-neutral object. The structured\nobject should have the 'on-the-fly' localization capability. One or more\nmethods can be invoked on the structured object which can produce all the\n'displayable texts' in a locale of choice.\n\nB.3  S-006  Impractical like B.2. See also A.32.\n\nB.4  S-007  See B.2 and A.32.\n\nB.5  S-008  An ideal case for i18nContext.\n\nB.6  S-009  The description of the use case is not very clear; a diagram\nmay help. Maybe the services and requesters should be labelled distinctly\nto avoid confusion. Some may think that for the way one-way\n'fire-and-forget' messaging, requesters can not receive any faults.  The\nreference (http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-desc-usecases/, Section 2.1.2) should be\nincluded to clarify the issue.\n\nAgain, the inbound i18nContext from provider \"A\" should influence the\nlanguage of the 'Reason' generated at \"B\".\n\nB.7  S-010  Can be viewed as the argument against using the Accept-Language\nHTTP header as the initial candidate for determining the inbound locale for\nSOAP-based messaging. SOAP i18nContext should ideally be totally\nindependent of the carrier protocol.\n\nB.8  S-011  Again the description can be somewhat clearer. See B.6, and\nB.2. The i18nContext can be used to generate the 'Reason' text.\n\nB.9  S-012  See A.10\n\nB.10 S-013  The name of the section is somewhat misleading. Will something\nlike 'Locale Sensitive Computation\" be a better choice?\n\nThe provider should be deployed as RunAscaller, and the invocation\ni18nContext should be used for the string comparison.\n\nB.11 S-014  We need to define the term 'Connection-Less'.\n\nB.12 S-015  Both \"A\" and \"B\" should use i18nContext. See A.3 too.\n\nB.13 S-016  The sentence: \"For example, 2003-05-31 in Korea ... Japan\"\nprobably needs some clarification [also I think it should be '2003-05-31 in\nFrance']. Are we referring to time zone issue?\n\nB.14 S-017  Is it possible to bring this scenario under the general canopy\nof 'locale' and 'time zone' in place of 'currency' and 'location'?\n\nB.15 S-018  i18nContext is of no use in the first example. The 'currency'\n(can it be generalized to 'locale'?) tag is a part of data, and the SOAP\nreceiver has to parse individual parts to interpret the price. The second\nexample mentions: \"It is possible ... SOAP header\". I think the sentence\nneeds more explanation or be completely omitted. In a clean Web service\nprogramming model all the meta information (here the 'default currency\nattribute') should be propagated as SOAP headers. We should not advocate a\nquestionable programming model in our use case document.\n\nB.16 S-019  The inbound i18nContext (the caller i18nContext) can be used to\ninterpret locale dependent inbound data.\n\n<toDo> Explore WSDL for the issue raised in this scenario. </toDo>\n\nB.17 S-020  The relevant section number of the WSA document should be\nprovided. Is the use case somewhat similar to B.9? Again, caching data and\nfaults in all possible languages is impractical. See also A.10.\n\nB.18 S-027  See B.4 and A.36.\n\nB.19 S-031  It may not be possible to advertise the internationalization\ncapabilities to the minutest possible detail; the size of that XML document\nwill be substantial. Can we decide on RunAsCaller type of thing, which at\nleast promises to provide the capability to localize (approximately in some\ncases) in commonly considered locales. WSDL annotations can externalize the\ndefault behaviour too.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi Deb,\n\nThanks for writing this. My stream-of-conciousness comments embedded \nbelow up to about S080. More detailed comments will come anon. This is \nreally great as a jumping off point for more action on Usage Scenarios!\n\nGenerally I think it would be very useful to prepare usage scenarios for \nthe items you cite at length and also to try and associate our existing \nscenarios with the WSArch document (the links may be 1::many). I like \nmost of your comments. My main criticism, which you can see below, is \nthat we need to separate \"application specific\" behaviors (\"best \npractices\") from things that WS standard can directly address. Many of \nthese problems are astoundingly familiar from my work at webMethods. I \ncould tell you how *we* addressed each in our proprietary platform. That \nwouldn't mean that you could or even would want to specify those designs \nin Web Services standards.\n\nIn addition, I think it is important to create as realistic a \ndemonstration or set of criticisms as possible. For example, several \ntimes below you cite currency concerns, but a well designed data \nstructure and application won't have that particular problem as an i18n \nproblem. It's only an i18n problem if you're ignoring multicurrency and \nusing a naked number or a string to move the value. This is poor data \nanalysis, not necessarily an i18n issue. Locale says nothing about what \ncurrency a particular value is in.\n\nAddison\n\nDebasish Banerjee wrote:\n\n>\n>\n>\n>Hi,\n>\n>Following contains some rough ideas and thoughts about the use of\n>internationalization contexts (i18nContext = a chain of locales + a time\n>zone) and their management policies (RunAsCaller, RunAsServer, and\n>RunAsSpecified) in the contexts of \"Web Services Architecture Usage\n>Scenarios\" and \"Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios\"\n>documents.\n>\n>I would like to receive your detailed comments.

Web Services Architecture Usage Scenarios Document dated July 30, 2002\n>(http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-arch-scenarios/)\n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n>A.1  S001   In this so called 'Fire-and-forget Single Receiver' scenario,\n>the sender can conceivably send localized messages to the receiver under\n>certain circumstances.

The example  presented in the document does not\n>mention whether the price of the stock is 34.5$ or 34.5 DM.\n>\n\nAP> The stock price is an example of poorly internationalized data \nstructure. The stock price ideally would not be a simple number, because \nthat is not consistent with a currency value and especially one as \ntransient and fungible as a stock price. A correct data structure is not \nlcoale affected. It might look something like this:\n\n<stockquote>\n   <symbol>SYY</symbol>  \n   <amount>1234.5</amount>  # this is xsd:float or xsd:double\n   <currency>USD</currency>   # this is an ISO4217\n   <time>2003-03-11T13:45:00GMT-5:00</time>  # this is xsd:date\n</stockquote>\n \nThe receiver's system can format that price to be what it wants within \nthe constraints of the data. A naive French program might display it as \n\"1 234,50$\", a less naive program might choose \"1 234,50 USD\" or even \n\"US$1 234,50\".\n\nWe can't guard against poorly internationalized code in the world, other \nthan to point at it and say \"no, that is not a good example.\" I'm shy of \ngetting into discussing examples that proceed from false assumptions.\n\nIf the example returned a human-readable string it would be a better \ncandiate for the comments that follow:\n\n<confirmation>\n   <msg lang=\"en-US\">This message is to confirm your purchase of {0, \nnumber, integer} shares of SYY on {1, datetime, medium} for {2, number, \ncurrency}.</msg>\n</confirmation>\n\n\n>\n>\n>Unless the sender is aware of the receiver's locale preference, the sender\n>will transmit all the messages either in its default or some pre-configured\n>locale.\n>\n>Question: Can the sender be aware of the receiver's locale preferences\n>through some sort of subscription metadata? \n>\nAP> Not with current WS protocols.

If 'multicast distribution\n>technology' is used, the same message (probably localized in sender's\n>default locale) will be received by all the receivers.

But \nagain this is an application specific problem.

It \nmight make sense to suggest to SOAP that they include a default message \n(with NO xml:lang tag)...\n\n>\n>\n>A.6  S007   All the partial responses should be localized under the\n>i18nContext established during the initial request.\n>\n><toDO> For a multi-threaded receiver processing many SOAP requests at the\n>same time, this use case needs careful investigation regarding the possible\n>storage and restoration of i18nContext (and other contexts as well) for\n>incremental asynchronous response generation. </toDO>\n>\nAP> This is an implementation problem, I think.\n\n>\n>\n>A.7  S010   Usually positive acknowledgements are locale insensitive in\n>nature, though some may think that the time zone element of the i18nContext\n>can be used for time stamping the acknowledgement. Of course, if UTC time\n>is mandated by the application semantics, the provider side may not have to\n>use the time zone information of the i18nContext.\n>\n>Negative acknowledgements can contain some sort of 'Reasons' consisting of\n>text messages.

However, in theory, some business logic may be\n>locale (and time zone) sensitive in nature: string comparisons, price\n>comparison (must be done in the same currency), etc. To be safe, the\n>'intermediary' and all the 'sellers' should be deployed as RunAsCaller.\n>\nAP> I disagree. Data structres are locale neutral. Business logic *may* \nbe locale neutral, but isn't required to be. If the intermediary defines \ndata structures that capture the data in a locale neutral way, then the \nimplementation of the business logic can generally be made to perform in \na locale-neutral manner... but not always.\n\nConsider a B2B transaction. Matching supplier and buyer may introduce \ndifferent locale- or at least location-sensitive variables into the \nequation. For example, I don't want to purchase froma supplier who's \nwarehouse is in China just because the product price is cheapest---the \ntransport costs and delivery latency may outweigh the price as a factor. \nOr if I buy something on the internet the taxation rules may vary \ndisadvantageously. I don't see how this kind of application logic can be \ndealt with except as an implementation decision in application. \ni18ncontext only informs the lower-level aspects of this (such as string \ncomparison).\n\nAs noted previously, I would steer clear of currency as an example. \nCorrect data structures remove the basic I18N problem (they may \nsubstitute the problem of calculating an up-to-the-moment conversion \nfactor, for example, but this is a higher-order application problem).\n\n>\n>\n>A.9  S031   The presented use case may not need any internationalization\n>consideration.\n>\nAP> Audit logging may resolve the log message to a specific locale or \nlanguage. Ideally the reconstructed routing log would be in the \nrequestors language preference (if possible).\n\n>\n>\n>A.10 S032   This caching can lead to extremely interesting applications of\n>i18nContext for cached results which are locale and/or time zone sensitive\n>in nature.\n>\n>(a) A simple but general strategy will be to deploy both the caching\n>intermediary and the service provider as RunAsCaller. For the very first\n>time, the response corresponding a locale is computed at the service\n>provider, and later cached at the intermediary. The caching store can\n>maintain a table of locale-vs.-result, which continues to grow over time.\n>On a subsequent request the intermediary first looks at the caching store\n>before forwarding the request to the service provider. If the caching store\n>contains the desired localized form of the result, the request does not\n>travel to the ultimate receiver.\n>\n... if the service's outputs or processing are locale affected at all. \nIt might be useful to define that a business process or interaction \nrunsAsNeutral......\n\n>\n>\n>Alternatively, under certain circumstances where localization can be\n>performed at the caching intermediary the following approach can also be\n>adopted.\n>\n>(b) The ultimate receiver (service provider) on receiving the initial SOAP\n>request may provide a structured locale-neutral object to the caching\n>intermediary. The caching intermediary stores the structured object in the\n>'caching store'. The intermediary deployed as RunAsCaller can now create\n>the concrete response by invoking proper operations on the cached\n>structured object using the propagated i18nContext. The intermediary can\n>continue to cache localized results in its local store and use them for\n>subsequent responses. For example, assume the first request is associated\n>with Japanese locale. The caching intermediary (1) receives and stores the\n>locale-neutral object from the ultimate receiver, (2) computes the response\n>in Japanese locale, stores a representation of it in its local store, and\n>(3) finally sends the SOAP response back to the initial sender (requester).\n>If a second request arrives with Korean locale, the caching intermediary\n>first performs step (2) in Korean locale before embarking on step (3). Now\n>if a subsequent request is associated again Japanese locale, the\n>intermediary skips step (2); it simply retrieves the result of Japanese\n>computation before completing step (3).\n>\n>\n>A.11 S035   Probably i18nContext has no bearing in this case.\n>\n>A.12 S036   If the time stamps values are in UTC (which will probably be\n>the case), there is no need to access i18nContext.\n>\nIf timestamps are xsd:date then they will be UTC or have a TZindicator.\n\n>\n>\n>A.13 S037   Same as S032. The intermediary must check the expiration\n>criterion.\n>\n>A.14 S040   Probably the most complex usage scenario regarding\n>internationalization. Need detailed investigation especially regarding\n>compensation spheres and compensating transactions. Interesting\n>localization may have to performed during compensation.\n>\nAP> But the pattern is also quite arbitrary. It may be possible to \nconsider only the individual discrete transactions without having to \nthink about the larger meta-context, excepting the fact that one desires \nthe process to be consistent and not subject to occuring in multiple \ncontexts. This speaks to Tex's concern about \"don't run if you can't \nsatisfy my requirements\". This pattern suggest that the first \ntransaction should fail if ANY of the subsequent transactions doesn't \nsupport the contextual requirements ??\n\n>\n>\n><toDo> Need to study the BPEL4WS spec. in detail and produce a few use\n>cases especially regarding 'container breach', context storage, context\n>retrieval, context switching, and of course compensation. </toDo>\n>\n>A.15 S061   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n>\n>A.16 S062   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n>\n>A.17 S0621  Internationalization is not an issue here.\n>\n>A.18 S063   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n>\n>A.19 S064   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n>\n>A.20 S065   Internationalization is not an issue here.\n>\n>A.21 S070   Another ideal scenario for i18nContext.

Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenario, dated February 18,\n>2003 (http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/)\n>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n>B.1  S-003  In case we have both i18nContext as a SOAP header and also the\n>'Accept-Language' HTTP header which one shall be honoured by the service\n>provider? Shall we stipulate: first i18nContext in the SOAP header and in\n>its absence the 'Accept-Language' header? After all we want to define the\n>internationalization semantics of Web services independent of the carrier\n>protocol (HTTP, SMTP, etc.).\n>\n>Also, why 'xml:lang' in SOAP fault and in general in SOAP responses? The\n>'Reason' can contain region dependent stuff too.  Can we envision a more\n>general tag something like 'xml:locale'?\n>\n>B.2  S-004  Clearly the suggested solution is impractical; in real life\n>enterprise environments, it may not be possible to generate and transmit a\n>'fault' containing 'Reason' in all available languages. This is an ideal\n>case for the use of i18nContext. The service provider's invocation\n>i18nContext should be used to generate the localized fault.\n>\n>In this context, it should be mentioned that the specification of 'fault'\n>in the SOAP 1.2 specification is rather weak and incomplete.\n>\n>(a) Unlike the exception models of the modern programming environments like\n>Java or C#, SOAP faults can not be nested.  The ability to nest faults\n>allows the application developers to maintain clear separation between\n>application-level fault details from low-level (say data access) fault\n>details without loosing any valuable diagnostic information. SOAP 1.x\n>should carefully consider the issue of defining nested/chained faults.\n>\n>(b) In a hop-by-hop SOAP processing model, the use of simple texts as a\n>fault 'Reason' is inadequate for the purpose of distributed\n>internationalization. The reverse chained nodes can all be configured under\n>different locales.\n>\n>Even in a simple two node request-response SOAP scenario, some may consider\n>the existing definition of SOAP fault to be inadequate. A Web service\n>provider may log certain category of faults locally before transmission.\n>Suppose a language negotiation mechanism as mentioned in the SOAP V1.2\n>primer, Dec. 19, 2002 (Section 2.3) exists between a SOAP requester and\n>service provider. Assume a fault is produced at an American server for\n>processing a request from a Japanese requester. Using the language\n>negotiation mechanism, the service provider can generate the fault in\n>Japanese language. If the Japanese language faults are logged at the\n>American server, the English speaking system administrator may have tough\n>time in interpreting the system log. Probably SOAP faults should be defined\n>to optionally contain a structured locale-neutral object. The structured\n>object should have the 'on-the-fly' localization capability. One or more\n>methods can be invoked on the structured object which can produce all the\n>'displayable texts' in a locale of choice.\n>\n>B.3  S-006  Impractical like B.2.

Maybe the services and requesters should be labelled distinctly\n>to avoid confusion. Some may think that for the way one-way\n>'fire-and-forget' messaging, requesters can not receive any faults.  The\n>reference (http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-desc-usecases/, Section 2.1.2) should be\n>included to clarify the issue.\n>\n>Again, the inbound i18nContext from provider \"A\" should influence the\n>language of the 'Reason' generated at \"B\".\n>\n>B.7  S-010  Can be viewed as the argument against using the Accept-Language\n>HTTP header as the initial candidate for determining the inbound locale for\n>SOAP-based messaging. SOAP i18nContext should ideally be totally\n>independent of the carrier protocol.\n>\n>B.8  S-011  Again the description can be somewhat clearer. See B.6, and\n>B.2. The i18nContext can be used to generate the 'Reason' text.\n>\n>B.9  S-012  See A.10\n>\n>B.10 S-013  The name of the section is somewhat misleading.

See A.3 too.\n>\n>B.13 S-016  The sentence: \"For example, 2003-05-31 in Korea ... Japan\"\n>probably needs some clarification [also I think it should be '2003-05-31 in\n>France'].

            "content": "Please find below some comments about the 20 December 2002 draft of\nWeb Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios[1].\n\n| 2.1.1.2 Description\n| \n|    SOAP is used for XML messages exchanging data among service nodes.\n\nNitpicking: \"service nodes\" implies that two services are talking\ntogether while SOAP only talks about nodes (sender and receiver) that\ncould be anything. I would replace \"service nodes\" by \"nodes\" or\n\"communicating parties\", or something equivalent which would be more\nneutral.\n\n| 2.1.2.2 Description\n| \n|    This scenario is divided into three aspects.\n|     1. A sender sends a SOAP message in non-Unicode encoding.\n|     2. A receiver receives a SOAP message in non-Unicode encoding.\n|     3. Interaction between SOAP layer and SOAP interface such as  \n|        programming language, middleware, operating systems etc. \n\nI was (and still am) a bit confused about this scenario which talks\nabout a SOAP layer and a SOAP interface. The concepts SOAP layer and\nSOAP interface do not appear in SOAP Version 1.2 Part 1: Messaging\nFramework[2], however, the XML Protocol Abstract Model[3] does show 3\nlayers[4]:\n- the underlying protocol layer.\n- the XMLP layer.\n- the XMLP application.\n\nInterestingly, the Web Services Architecture document[5] is not\nextremely explicit about this and the XML Protocol Abstract Model\nshould be harvested to reflect this. I am putting this on my to-do\nlist.\n\nAnyway, back to I18N issues, I think that the problem of character\nencoding manifests itself at two levels:\n- between the underlying protocol layer and the XMLP layer. A SOAP\n  binding takes care of the bridging from one to the other. The\n  binding has the responsibility of reconstructing the infoset, and\n  the underlying protocol of the receiver could not support the\n  encoding used by the sender.\n- between the XMLP layer and the XMLP application: the application\n  could, as mentioned in section 2.1.2.2, not support a particular\n  encoding.\n\n| 2.2.1.2 Description\n|      \n|    When a SOAP fault occurs, SOAP fault messages containing natural\n|    language descriptions of the error(s) are sent back to the requester.\n|    The requester usually wants to see error messages in the requester's \n|    preferred language(s) and data format. Currently the following\n|    mechanism is available with the HTTP binding.\n|     \n|    Accept-language: The Accept-Language request-header field restricts\n|    the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the\n|    request. [RFC2616]\n|    \n|    Using Accept-language, a requester can notify a provider of the  \n|    requester's language preference. A provider can then send SOAP-Fault\n|    messages in the requester's preferred language(s). If a SOAP message \n|    does not use the HTTP binding, how can a SOAP-Fault message detect\n|    the requester's language preference.\n\nSome I18N problems may indeed be solved with Accept- headers, but\nthese are indeed specific to HTTP.\n\nConveniently, SOAP 1.2 defines the concept of feature[6] which are\nsome properties and extensions of a SOAP message that can be expressed\neither in the envelope or in the binding.\n\nOne could imagine a I18N extension describing I18N-specific\nprocessing. When possible, e.g. with HTTP, some of these properties\ncould be carried by the underlying protocol, and when not, they could\nstill be present in the SOAP envelope.\n\nSuch meta-data is part of what people have called policies (encoding\nand language preference and requirements, security features, privacy\npolicy, etc) in the context of Web services, which IMO applies to more\nthan only Web services. The Web Services Description Working Group has\na task force working on describing these properties and features in\nWSDL 1.2, and their role and place in the architecture is not well\nknown yet.\n\n| 2.2.8 Language Preference for Multiple Transmission Protocols Binding\n|                                                                      \n| 2.2.8.1 Scenario Definition                                          \n|                             \n|    SOAP message variation if http or ftp or SMTP or RMI or IIOP\n|    (difficulty deploying in a single WSDL)\n|    \n| 2.2.8.2 Description\n| \n|     1. Service \"A\" is defined on Provider \"A\".\n|     2. The administrator of Provider \"A\" wishes to deploy the same   \n|        service on several bindings simultaneously in the same WSDL file.\n|        \n|      * SOAP structure requires different semantics for language\n|        preference for each binding?                            \n\nThis is where features could help.\n\n| 2.3.4 Locale Dependent Datatypes\n| \n| 2.3.4.1 Scenario Definition\n| \n|    A sender wishes to send locale dependent data to a receiver for\n|    regional SOAP messaging or RPC. The receiver needs to process the\n|    locale dependent data correctly.\n|    \n| 2.3.4.2 Description\n[..]\n|    If WSDL can describe locale sensitive datatypes, locale negotiation\n|    mechanism can be described in WSDL. Is it applicable requirement for\n|    interface definition of WSDL?   \n\nWSDL's feature description support might be the key for this IMO.\n\n| 2.5.1 Locale Sensitive Processing by Provider(Receiver)\n| \n| 2.5.1.1 Scenario Definition\n| \n|    The service provider needs the locale of the sender in order to\n|    perform locale sensitive processing. There are three levels to this:\n|    Transport layer, service provider layer (SOAP Header), and service\n|    layer (SOAP Body) (we need separate scenarios for these)\n|\n| 2.5.1.2 Description\n[..]\n\nAs I mentioned above, SOAP 1.2 does not talk about layers. I do not\nunderstand the distinction made between SOAP headers and body. Since\nthey are part of the same infoset, it seems to me that they suffer\nfrom the same problems. Maybe when there are additional scenarios as\nhinted in this section, things will become clearer.\n\nNonetheless, I would be careful about introducing this concept of two\nlayers in a SOAP message which I think isn't present in the SOAP 1.2\nspecification.\n\nRegards,\n\nHugo\n\n  1. http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-i18n-scenarios-20021220/\n  2. http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/\n  3. http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlp-am-20010709/\n  4. http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-xmlp-am-20010709/#Sec2\n  5. http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-20021114/\n  6. http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/#soapfeature\n-- \nHugo Haas - W3C\nmailto:hugo@w3.org - http://www.w3.org/People/Hugo/\n\n\n\n"

Deb will try to address with the IBM rep. (Christopher Lowes) and to W3C-I18N-WG via WSTF. AP to coordinate these comments within the WG, as Core TF is more clearly responsible than we are.\n\n--------------------------\n> 2. Discussion of WS-Architecture Usage Scenarios comments from Addison, Kuro.\n\nDiscussion of neutral vs. server. Felt that these are very similar patterns in today's implementations. Highlighted minor differences.\n\nDiscussed differences in xsd:language vs. xml:lang. xsd:language defines type for modeling purposes and for data structuring, while xml:lang is more of an attribute. Note that XMLSchema refers to RFC1766 directly and XML 1.0 2nd Edition also refers to RFC3066 only obliquely (via errata).\n\nTex: Should show other preferences, such as (for example) Timezone, not just natural language.\n\nAddison: A 6th pattern not shown: passing language or \"locale\" preference all the way across intermediary or performing language matching in the intermediary.\n\n---------------------------\nEditorial Meeting Discussion.\n\nDiscussed whether we should publish the results of the editorial meeting as a new WD of the Usage Scenarios document. The quiet period prior to WWW conference starts next Wednesday (the day following our editorial meeting). This limits time available for commentary severely.\n\nBy acclamation, we decided that the result of the editorial meeting will be published without additional review or telecon as a new Working Draft. Members can review work semi-live as we edit it next Monday/Tuesday. Otherwise we have a desire to publish.\n\n**************Please send material.***************\n\n\n> \n> Thanks,\n> \n> Addison\n> \n> Addison P.

            "content": "Hi Kuro,\n\nWe can discuss it at our next meeting, although I would suggest that W3C-I18N Core TF would probably be a more appropriate venue.\n\nSpeaking strictly for myself, I agree that this is really and truly broken as a design.\n\nIn point of fact, I'm not sure that the HTTP header actually wins in practice, since in at least some cases the XML parser/processor gets the bytestream separate from the HTTP transfer mechanism. Mis- or unlabeled content that isn't pre-converted from a bytestream to a character representation survives this and then probably the XML declaration \"wins\". Of course, the fact that they conflict at all is a problem.\n\nIn terms of Web services, though, this isn't generally a problem. The media type for a SOAP message is commonly 'application/soap+xml'. I quote from the SOAP 1.2 Primer:\n\nWhen placing SOAP messages in HTTP bodies, the HTTP Content-type header must be chosen as \"application/soap+xml\". (The optional charset parameter, which can take the value of \"utf-8\" or \"utf-16\", is shown in this example, but if it is absent the character set rules for freestanding [XML 1.0] apply to the body of the HTTP request.)\n\nWhich is located here:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-soap12-part0-20030507/#L26866\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

            "subject": "A Few Possible Use case",
            "content": "Hi,\n\nHere are initial ideas for a few use cases dealing with eBusiness and\nbusiness choreography.\n\n1.  Assume the existence of an online store in some country (say Russia)\noffering various goods and services (Caviar, Vodka, Matruskas, Chess\nlessons, Science books, etc.). The base price of each good is in Russian\ncurrency: Rubles. For a non-Russian customer, not familiar with the Russian\ncurrency system, the price of the offered goods and services in Rubles may\nmake very little sense. For non-Russian customers, the online catalogue of\nthe retailer may intend to display prices in two currencies: the base price\nin Rubles, and an approximate price in the default currency derived from\nthe country code portion of the customer's locale. Thus an American user\nwill see prices both in US $ and Russian Rubles; a Japanese customer in\nJapanese Yen and Russian Rubles and so on. A Russian customer will of\ncourse see the prices only in Russian Rubles.\n\nThe system can use some local 'currency conversion' module (or even a\nremote 'currency conversion' web service) for converting Rubles into other\nforms of currencies. If a default currency can not be derived out of\n'caller's locale', the default base currency can always be used.\n\nNote that, the values displayed in customers default currencies are\napproximate and intended for user friendliness. During the actual business\ntransaction, when the buyer submits his credit card, the accurate currency\nconversion will be performed--most probably by some specialized Web\nservices interfacing with the financial institutions.\n\n2.  Again assume the existence of an online retailer selling goods (say\nbooks). Assume a Japanese customer ordered a few books from the catalogue\nafter supplying his/her credit card details to the retailer. The online\nstore software after accepting the order will probably send asynchronous\nmessage(s) to it warehouses(s) requesting the actual shipment of the books.\nThe warehouse(s) after shipping the order will probably eMail the customer\nabout the shipping details: courier(s) used, the tracking number(s),\ndate(s) shipped, expected date(s) of arrival at customer address, etc. The\neMail is generated from a standard template and SHOULD be produced in the\ncustomer's locale (language). This requires the propagation of the inbound\ncaller's international context information in the asynchronous messages(s)\nfrom the eStore to warehouse(s). Since warehouse(s) typically require a few\ndays for actual shipment, the internationalization context should be stored\nalong with the order until the entire transaction gets completed. The eMail\nto the customer SHOULD also show the amount charged to his credit card\nformatted according to customer's locale and not in the locale of the\nwarehouse server.\n\nIn real life scenario, other intermediate eMails may get directed to the\ncustomer during the entire business transaction. One or more books may be\ntemporarily out of stock, partial shipment, etc. All these communications\nSHOULD originate from appropriate servers of the online retailing system in\nthe locale of the customer.\n\n3. Imagine a travel agency service providing complete travel assistance\nincluding airline reservation, car rental, hotel reservation, etc. Customer\nsubmits a travel itinerary and the travel agency fires three parallel\nprocesses to process airline, hotel and car rental reservations based on\nthe input itinerary. Imagine, two reservation tasks succeeded (say airlines\nand car rental) and the third one (the hotel reservation) failed. The\ntravel agency will now compensate the already reserved airlines and car\nrental bookings. As a part of the overall compensation, the travel agency\nsoftware informs the customer too. Sophisticated systems may suggest\nalternative itinerary to the customer. The material communicated to the\ncustomer may get generated from standard templates and SHOULD be in the\ncustomer's locale and not in the locale of the travel agency server. This\nrequires the storage of the inbound customer's internationalization context\nto be stored until the entire long running transaction (LRT) gets complete.\nThe stored internationalization context may get used in driving parts of\nthe compensation logic.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "I think these are reasonable scenarios; however, the description of\nthe 'solution' must be spelled out. That is, the real requirements are\nmasked under the heading of 'internationalization context'. These need\nto be spelled out in all of the scenarii, so that we see exactly what\nis required.\n\nFor #1: customer's preferred language, 'courtesy'* currency,\ncredit-card information, billing address, credit-card address.\n\n*The site may only offer a limited number of these 'courtesy'\ncurrencies, so even though my preferred currency may be Swedish\ncrowns, I may be limited to rubles, euros and dollars.\n\nFor #2: customer's preferred language, and the currency *of the\ntransaction*, credit-card information, billing address, credit-card\naddress.\n\n* may not be the customer's preferred currency! My preferred currency\nmight be dollars, but I might have ordered in Yen (because that is\nwhat the site offered); that will be what is charged to my credit\ncard.\n\nFor #3: customer's preferred language, and the currency *of the\ntransaction*, credit-card information, billing address, credit-card\naddress, ticket delivery address, mileage numbers (airline, hotel,\ncar), reservations numbers, customer's preferred timezone.\n\nOther customers may have other requirements. We are working with one\nthat requires at least: transaction currency (again, NOT derivable\nfrom the customer's country), customer's country of residence,\ncustomer's bank account country, recipient's country of residence,\nrecipient's bank account country.\n\nI may be missing a few things here; we need to flesh these out until\nthey are real-to-life.\n\nMark Davis\n________\nmark.davis@jtcsv.com\nIBM, MS 50-2/B11, 5600 Cottle Rd, SJ CA 95193\n(408) 256-3148\nfax: (408) 256-0799\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Debasish Banerjee\" <debasish@us.ibm.com>\nTo: \"Addison Phillips [wM]\" <aphillips@webmethods.com>\nCc: <public-i18n-ws@w3.org>\nSent: Wednesday, May 21, 2003 15:29\nSubject: A Few Possible Use cases\n\n\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> Hi,\n>\n> Here are initial ideas for a few use cases dealing with eBusiness\nand\n> business choreography.\n>\n> 1.

            "content": "I had the same general reaction to Deb's scenarios that Mark did. In \nthinking about them further, here's what I came up with:\n\nThe problem with the scenarios appears to be that Deb is thinking like \nan application writer. The description is of the overall \napplication--the effect or business process being modeled. This is \nnatural, but it doesn't capture the i18n problem clearly.\n\nThe Choreography problem looks like this. Consider that you have created \nfour Web services to perform some tasks. Let's say that service A \nreceives customer orders, service B checks customer credit, service C \nships product from the warehouse, and service D updates accounts receivable.\n\nThese services are SEPARATE. They each have their own WSDL file, QoS, \nand so forth. Choreography is really the bundling of extant services \ninto a process, so the customer isn't billed until the product ships, \nfor example.\n\nThe trick here is that an aspect of one of the MIDDLE services in the \nprocess may be client-influenced. How does the WSDL file that describes \nthe choreographed transaction reflect that fact? What is the pattern of \n\"context\" or information that must be passed all the way from the \ninitial SOAP processor to make the service in the middle (say the credit \ncheck) able to deal with a localization issue?\n\nSo I guess my points are:\n\n1. We really need to fill in the various scenarios for the roughly five \npatterns in the usage scenarios document (language-neutral, \nclient-inflenced, and the three servide-determined flavors). Since all \nof the more complex interactions appear to be the interplay between \nthese patterns on various levels, doing this will give us a firm foundation.\n\n2. This suggests that choreography and other more complex interactions \ncan be thought of as ways of packaging a series of services as a \nservice. If each of the services has a different pattern, what pattern \ndoes the overall service have?\n\nMore anon,\n\nAddison\n\n-- \nAddison P.

A service that itself is language independent may still \nneed the language preference when generating a fault (for example).\n\nAnother way to look at it would be that the pattern applies to the \nspecific service (the method call that the SOAP processor eventually \nmakes for you), not the SOAP cruft around it.\n\n>So what I\n> did in the talk was to say that these are aspects than can\n> appear combined in a Web service.

A case could also \nbe made that this is an example of \nlanguage-neutral-but-still-internationalized. (Yes, you still have to \ni18n your language-neutral services ;-)). In the latter case, the \nservice does something different because of a piece of data that it \nreceives. The fact that i18n folks feel some affinity for one piece of \ndata or another doesn't really matter. Infering the measuring system or \ncurrency from a language tag or locale is prone to error.\n\nI should point out that you can have a language-neutral service (by this \nmeasure) that takes a language as an argument (inbound message data \nelement).

            "content": "Hi Kuro,\n\nFirst, the intent is that all SOAP messages should be encoded using UTF-8 or\nUTF-16. That doesn't mean that they actually are or that utf-8/utf-16 are\nthe only valid values here. You *can* create SOAP messages in another\nencoding.\n\nThe application/soap+xml type is defined here:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-soap12-part2-20030507/#ietf-draft\n\nWhich refers to here:\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt  (see Page 9).\n\nWhich says (and I quote):\n\n<quot>\n      Although listed as an optional parameter, the use of the charset\n      parameter is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, since this information can be\n      used by XML processors to determine authoritatively the charset of\n      the XML MIME entity.  The charset parameter can also be used to\n      provide protocol-specific operations, such as charset-based\n      content negotiation in HTTP.\n\n      \"utf-8\" [RFC2279] and \"utf-16\" [RFC2781] are the recommended\n      values, representing the UTF-8 and UTF-16 charsets, respectively.\n      These charsets are preferred since they are supported by all\n      conforming processors of [XML].\n\n      If an application/xml entity is received where the charset\n      parameter is omitted, no information is being provided about the\n      charset by the MIME Content-Type header.  Conforming XML\n      processors MUST follow the requirements in section 4.3.3 of [XML]\n      that directly address this contingency.  However, MIME processors\n      that are not XML processors SHOULD NOT assume a default charset if\n      the charset parameter is omitted from an application/xml entity.\n</quot>\n\nIt is a bad idea generally to create SOAP documents that don't use Unicode\nbecause there is no guarantee that the SOAP Processor supports anything but\nUnicode.\n\nThe Content-Type of application/soap+xml is NOT a text/* type for a reason.\nFor one thing it gets you out of the ASCII default.\n\nA Content-Transfer-Encoding is generally applied to data external to the\nactual content encoding and content processing. You are probably familiar\nwith MIME, which is used for transporting non-ASCII data. Generally speaking\nin both HTTP and SMTP, the actual SOAP document arrives as an attachment and\nis MIME encoded. You don't have to deal with this, as it is part of the\ntransport stack.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: public-i18n-ws-request@w3.org\n> [mailto:public-i18n-ws-request@w3.org]On Behalf Of Kurosaka, Teruhiko\n> Sent: Thursday, May 29, 2003 4:44 PM\n> To: Public-I18n-Ws (E-mail)\n> Subject: charset use in SOAP 1.2\n>\n>\n>\n> I'm browsing the final spec of SOAP 1.2 Primer\n> http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-soap12-part0-20030507/\n> and I have two questions.\n>\n> Near\n> http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-soap12-part0-20030507/#L26866\n> (thank you, Addision, for the pointer)\n> it reads:\n>\n>  > When placing SOAP messages in HTTP bodies, the HTTP\n> Content-type header\n>  > must be chosen as \"application/soap+xml\".

I can edit it \ndown if we think it's a safe assumption.\n\nAndrea\n\nScenario I-0?? Calendar-related events\n\nA Web service is set up to calculate a calendar date and send it back to \nthe requester.  The date is calendar-related but is not associated with \na particular locale or timezone.  The service may need to take in \ninformation such as the calendar type, year, and related descriptive \ninformation.\n\nScenario A:  A service calculates the date for Easter, Passover, or \nRamadan for any given year in a specified calendar type.  All these \nholidays are strictly calendar related; they are calculated based on \ncertain calendar and lunar events, as well as historical tables.  The \nSOAP request would contain a holiday, a year, and a parameter indicating \nthe calendar type, e.g. \"Gregorian\".  In addition, some other data may \nbe required, such as for Easter there may be a parameter specifying \n\"Orthodox\" or \"Western\".  The Web service would in turn calculate the \nappropriate date and send a message back to the requester with the \ncalculated date.  It may seem as though the calendar type is a part of \nthe locale information, but locale information is typically associated \nwith the end user, and there's far more information in a locale than is \nneeded. In this case, the calendar type is irrelevant to the locale, \nsince the requester may be looking for information unrelated to user \npreferences or system settings.\n\nScenario B:  A service calculates historical dates in different parts of \nthe world and returns an equivalent Gregorian calendar date to the \nrequester.  The SOAP request would contain a date and its country of \norigin.  For example, a request might have the date 1812/08/26 and the \norigin \"Russia\".  Russia was not using the Gregorian calendar at that \ntime, so that date is not equivalent to the same date in places such as \nEngland or Germany.  While this may look locale-related due to the \ncountry of origin, it should not be treated as such.  Locales are \ntypically associated with the end user, not with a piece of data.  A \nlocale contains far more information than is relevant to this \ncalculation as well.\n\nScenario C:  A service calculates Chinese New Year for any non-Chinese \ncalendar type.  The SOAP request would include a parameter with the \ncalendar type, such as \"Gregorian\", \"Hebrew\", or \"Japanese Imperial\". \nIt may seem as though the calendar type is a part of the locale \ninformation, but locale information is typically associated with the end \nuser, and there's far more information in a locale than is needed. In \nthis case, the calendar type is irrelevant to the locale, since the \nrequester may be looking for information unrelated to user preferences \nor system settings.\n\n\n\n"

The first part is discovery and configuration. The second part is the request. The third part is the optional response. In the diagram above, the purple arrows are the discovery, the blue arrows are the request, and the red arrows are the response.</p>\n<p>An important aspect of Web services is distinguishing between the actual \"service\" (the function, method, or other logic that actually does something) and the Web service \"provider\" or \"agent\" (the process that receives and emits SOAP messages). In the diagram above, we show the \"client process\" and the \"requester agent\" as being in one machine, while the \"provider agent\" and the \"actual service\" are in separate machines or processes. Neither of these cases is necessarily the case: the provider agent may host the service inside its process, just as the client process and requester agent might be on separate machines.</p>\n<p>Discovery</p>\n<p>Discovery of Web services can be done in many ways. For example, the system administrators on either end of the transaction may just have a conversation or exchange WSDL files (Web service descriptions). </p>\n<p>Or a UDDI registry or other automated mechanism might be used. </p>\n<p>In any case, the Web service description contains the information about how to invoke the service and what, if any, response to expect. This includes the data structures passed to the service itself and the data structures returned (if any). It may also contain contextual information, generally contained in headers, such as the information required for quality-of-service, security, transactionality, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Each service or set of services may provide a variety of ways to be invoked, with different URLs, ports, and other information distinguishing the various invocations. Each specific collection (single way of invoking a Web service), consisting of a URL, request and response  is called a \"binding\". This information is typically generated by the \"provider agent\" and is fed to the \"requester agent\" in order to configure the requester to invoke the service.</p>\n<p>Request</p>\n<p>The request goes, as shown, through several stages:</p>\n<olist>\n<item><p>The caller invokes the service in the requester agent somehow.</p></item>\n<item><p>The requester agent formulates the SOAP message that will invoke the service. It uses the WSDL to create and populate the message body and any headers, attachments, and so forth as set out in the description.</p></item>\n<item><p>The SOAP message is dispatched over the transport (typically HTTP, but not always so) to the URL in the WSDL. This generally represents the provider agent, but may also involve an intermediary server which forwards the request.</p></item>\n<item><p>The provider agent receives and decodes the message. This may result in an error, in which case a SOAP Fault message may be generated as a response.</p></item>\n<item><p>If the SOAP message was decoded successfully, recognized, and valid for a service supported by the provider agent (e.g. it was not in error), the provider agent will now attempt to invoke the service itself.</p>\n<p>Note that invoking the service may result in an error (if, for example, the service isn't currently available) and also that the service itself might result in an error.</p></item>\n</olist>\n<p>Response</p>\n<p>Not all services generate a response, either when an error is encountered or with a successful result. If the message exchange pattern calls for a response, then the following steps apply:</p>\n<olist>\n<item><p>The service returns its result(s) to the provider agent. This may, as noted above, be a successful result or an error.</p></item>\n<item><p>The provider agent formulates the SOAP message that will be the response. The results of the service are used to build any message body and the provider agent fills in any additional header information.</p></item>\n<item><p>The SOAP message is then returned over the transport to the requester agent.

Calendar-dependent events\n\nA Web service is set up to calculate a calendar date and send it back to\nthe requester.  The date is calendar-dependent but is not associated with\na particular locale or timezone.  The service may need to take in\ninformation such as the calendar type, year, and related descriptive\ninformation.\n\nScenario A:  A service calculates the date for Easter, Passover, or\nRamadan for any given year in a specified calendar type.  All these\nholidays are strictly calendar-dependent; they are calculated based on\ncertain calendar and lunar events, as well as historical tables.  The\nSOAP request would contain a holiday, a year, and a parameter indicating\nthe calendar type, e.g. \"Gregorian\".  In addition, some other data may\nbe required, such as for Easter there may be a parameter specifying\n\"Orthodox\" or \"Western\".  The Web service would in turn calculate the\nappropriate date and send a message back to the requester with the\ncalculated date.  It may seem as though the calendar type is a part of\nthe locale information, but locale information is typically associated\nwith the end user, and there's far more information in a locale than is\nneeded. In this case, the calendar type is irrelevant to the locale,\nsince the requester may be looking for information unrelated to user\npreferences or system settings.\n\nScenario B:  A service calculates historical dates in different parts of\nthe world and returns an equivalent Gregorian calendar date to the\nrequester.  The SOAP request would contain a date and its country of\norigin.  For example, a request might have the date 1812/08/26 and the\norigin \"Russia\".  Russia was not using the Gregorian calendar at that\ntime, so that date is not equivalent to the same date in places such as\nEngland or Germany.  While this may look like it is part of the locale due to \nthe country of origin, it should not be treated as such.  Locales are\ntypically associated with the end user, not with a piece of data.  A\nlocale contains far more information than is relevant to this\ncalculation as well.\n\nScenario C:  A service calculates Chinese New Year for any non-Chinese\ncalendar type.  The SOAP request would include a parameter with the\ncalendar type, such as \"Gregorian\", \"Hebrew\", or \"Japanese Imperial\".\nThe calendar type is again irrelevant to the locale, since the\nrequester may be looking for information unrelated to user preferences\nor system settings.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "All,\nThis is an updated draft of text for Section 2 in the new outline.\nText in curly braces is instruction and not to be included.\nAndrea\n\n2. Introduction to Web Services\n\nThis section contains a \"framework\" or outline for understanding\ninternational issues in Web services.\n\nThe framework is based on the Web Services Architecture document [WSA],\nwhich defines a service as follows: \"A Web service is a software system designed \nto support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has \nan interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL). \nOther systems interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its \ndescription using SOAP-messages, typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML \nserialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards.\" {this is the \nlatest from the WSA doc, but I wonder if we should include liteeral text from a \nmoving target...}\n\nThere are some important standards associated with Web services. Simple\nObject Access Protocol (SOAP) describes the protocol used for\ncommunication with a Web service.\n\nSOAP defines a two-section document structure that\nconforms to XML specifications. The first part of the document is the\nenvelope, essentially routing instructions for the body message that\nfollows. The second part is the body message, which contains\ninformation the Web service requires for processing and/or a remote\nprocedure call. SOAP documents can have attachments with header\ninformation in MIME format. The SOAP document, like any XML file, may\ncontain a charset tag, which describes the data contained in that\nparticular document only. An attachment can have data in a different\ncharset; that charset can be specified in the MIME header Content-type.\nFor specifying the language of their content, SOAP documents can contain \nxml:lang tags according to the XML standard [XML]. A SOAP attachment's language \ncan be indicated in the MIME header Content-language.\n\nWeb Services Description Language (WSDL) [WSDL-V12] is an XML-conformant\nlanguage used to describe the information necessary for calling and\nusing a Web service.\n\nWeb services can be discovered in many ways. One method is by searching a \nUniversal Description, Discovery, and Integration [UDDI] registry. UDDI entries \ndescribe the available service and point to the Web Service Description (WSD) \nvia a URI. The Web Service Description is typically written in WSDL, and it\ndocuments the mechanics of the message exchange between a requester and\na provider.\n\nThese standards work together as shown in the following scenario:\n\n{diagram here, modified version of the old 2.1 Overview diagram}\n\n    1.  The requester agent locates a suitable provider agent, usually\nrequiring human intervention. This can be accomplished through UDDI, but\nalso can be accomplished through other means. For example, the URL of\nthe provider agent may simply have been found in an advertisement somewhere.\n    2.  The provider agent makes available a WSD document, which is\nlikely written in WSDL.\n    3.  Using the information in the WSD, the requester agent can\nformulate a service request. This will be a SOAP message which is then\nsent to the provider agent to be acted upon.\n    4.  The provider agent after receiving the request will invoke the\nservice and get a response. The response can be the results of the\nservice or an indication that a fault occurred. Note that the\ninteraction between the provider agent and the service are independent\nof the Web Services framework and the design is left completely to the\nimplementors. The primary requirement is that the provider agent in turn\nbe able to formulate a response to return to the requester agent. This\nresponse must satisfy both the requirements and specifications of the\nWeb Services Architecture and the description of the WSD.\n    5.  If the service request was successfully executed, the provider\nagent will formulate a response message and send it to the requester agent.\n    6.  If the service request was erroneous, or the service could not\nbe completed for some reason, a fault message will be sent to the\nrequester agent.\n\nThe internationalization issues in Web services and as illustrated in\nthe framework fall into several categories that are common to all Web\nservices, regardless of the message exchange pattern used. In the section that \nfollows it is assumed that the service, provider and requester agents, and data \nstructures (semantics) follow best practices in internationalization and data \nstructuring. Implicit in these descriptions is the expectation that data \nstructures use XML Schema types to create locale-neutral data structures.\n\nSome services may be implemented that do not follow these strictures for\nreasons having to do with legacy system implementation or other\nrestriction. These cases are dealt with in usage scenarios later in this\ndocument.\n\n{add text about MEPs and SOAP Features somewhere in this section?}\n\n\n\n"

Is the request to get back e.g.\nWestern Easter in the Thai Buddhist calendar, or Ramadan\nin the Julian calendar,...? Isn't this just a conflation of\ntwo separate tasks, namely a) getting the date(s) of the event\nin a locale-neutral form (i.e. ISO 8601 / XML Schema date format),\nand b) converting these dates to the desired calendar?\n\n\n>Scenario B:  A service calculates historical dates in different parts of\n>the world and returns an equivalent Gregorian calendar date to the\n>requester.

            "content": "XML Schema does a lackluster job of explaing any of this.\n\nI probably wouldn't use ranges for a calendric (non-point) date value. I'd probably use the 'xsd:date' type in preference to a 'xsd:dateTime', e.g. '2003-11-25' instead of '2003-11-25T00:00:00Z'. The point then is that you should not interpret a calendric date using a time zone (either your local one or some other value). Alas xsd:date allows a timezone identifier...\n\nThis is contrary to most date arithmetic in Java and other programming languages, where dates are, as you say, generally just of the point type and you must interpolate the 'right value' from a specific date object or apply the correct usage based on implementation decisions. There is some question, for example, of whether midnight GMT or noon GMT is a better 'default' value for a date object representing a 'calendric value' like this (since noon actually falls during the day for nearly all time zones, whereas midnight doesn't affect the bits in the underlying long integer value).\n\nIn any case, the mere fact that we're having this discussion points up the fact that most developers have, in my experience, a lot of trouble with date, datetime, timezone, and related event-driven issues: this is a neglected topic of discussion.

Stating that it is\nJuly 12, 1999 GMT does convey different information than just July 12, 1999\n(undetermined zone), or than July 12, 1999 Pacific Time.\n\nNote that July 12, 1999 08:00 Pacific Time is very different than July 12, 1999\n08:00 GMT-08:00. You see that when you start to set up a repeating meeting, such\nas in calendar software. If we meet every month on the 12th at 08:00 PT, that\nwill be sometimes 8:00 GMT-08:00 and sometimes 07:00 GMT-08:00. And in most\ncases, PT is what people want instead of GMT-08:00.\n\nMark\n__________________________________\nhttp://www.macchiato.com\n??? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Addison Phillips [wM]\" <aphillips@webmethods.com>\nTo: \"Mark Davis\" <mark.davis@jtcsv.com>; <andrea.vine@Sun.COM>;\n<public-i18n-ws@w3.org>\nSent: Tue, 2003 Nov 25 13:02\nSubject: RE: calendar *dependent* events scenarii\n\n\n\nXML Schema does a lackluster job of explaing any of this.\n\nI probably wouldn't use ranges for a calendric (non-point) date value. I'd\nprobably use the 'xsd:date' type in preference to a 'xsd:dateTime', e.g.\n'2003-11-25' instead of '2003-11-25T00:00:00Z'. The point then is that you\nshould not interpret a calendric date using a time zone (either your local one\nor some other value). Alas xsd:date allows a timezone identifier...\n\nThis is contrary to most date arithmetic in Java and other programming\nlanguages, where dates are, as you say, generally just of the point type and you\nmust interpolate the 'right value' from a specific date object or apply the\ncorrect usage based on implementation decisions. There is some question, for\nexample, of whether midnight GMT or noon GMT is a better 'default' value for a\ndate object representing a 'calendric value' like this (since noon actually\nfalls during the day for nearly all time zones, whereas midnight doesn't affect\nthe bits in the underlying long integer value).\n\nIn any case, the mere fact that we're having this discussion points up the fact\nthat most developers have, in my experience, a lot of trouble with date,\ndatetime, timezone, and related event-driven issues: this is a neglected topic\nof discussion. It's nice to explain some of it.\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

The character encoding of the SOAP message and\nthe communication of the encoding between senders and receivers enable this\nto occur reliably. Because all XML <a href=\"#XML\">[XML]</a> processors must\nbe able to read entities in both the UTF-8 <a href=\"#RFC2279\">[RFC2279]</a>\nand UTF-16 <a href=\"#RFC2781\">[RFC2781]</a> encodings, using UTF-8 or UTF-16\nguarantees character encoding interoperability on the SOAP layer. The\nCharacter Model for the World Wide Web <a href=\"#CHARMOD\">[CHARMOD]</a>\ndocument describes these considerations and guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using SOAP 1.1 and the Content-Type text/xml, then the charset\nparameter MUST be supplied in order to ensure correct interoperability,\nbecause the default for text/xml is us-ascii. If you are using SOAP 1.2, then\nthe Content-Type signature is application/soap+xml. If the charset parameter\nfor that media type is omitted using application/soap+xml then the SOAP\ndocument will be examined for encoding using the rules provided in XML. In\nall cases the charset parameter in the media type takes precedence over that\nof the XML that forms the SOAP document. Please refer to RFC3023, XML 1.0,\nand RFC2045/2046 for more information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario C:</strong> A SOAP Sender sends a legacy (non-Unicode)\nencoded request which the receiver doesn't support. The SOAP processor should\nfail and may return a fault.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario D:</strong> A SOAP processor receives and processes a\nrequest and returns a result.

The character encoding of the SOAP message and\nthe communication of the encoding between senders and receivers enable this\nto occur reliably. Because all XML <a href=\"#XML\">[XML]</a> processors must\nbe able to read entities in both the UTF-8 <a href=\"#RFC2279\">[RFC2279]</a>\nand UTF-16 <a href=\"#RFC2781\">[RFC2781]</a> encodings, using UTF-8 or UTF-16\nguarantees character encoding interoperability on the SOAP layer. The\nCharacter Model for the World Wide Web <a href=\"#CHARMOD\">[CHARMOD]</a>\ndocument describes these considerations and guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using SOAP 1.1 and the Content-Type text/xml, then the charset\nparameter MUST be supplied in order to ensure correct interoperability,\nbecause the default for text/xml is us-ascii. If you are using SOAP 1.2, then\nthe Content-Type signature is application/soap+xml. If the charset parameter\nfor that media type is omitted using application/soap+xml then the SOAP\ndocument will be examined for encoding using the rules provided in XML. In\nall cases the charset parameter in the media type takes precedence over that\nof the XML that forms the SOAP document. Please refer to RFC3023, XML 1.0,\nand RFC2045/2046 for more information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario C:</strong> A SOAP Sender sends a legacy (non-Unicode)\nencoded request which the receiver doesn't support. The SOAP processor should\nfail and may return a fault.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario D:</strong> A SOAP processor receives and processes a\nrequest and returns a result. The response is encoded uses a character\nencoding not supported by the original Sender. The Sender will not be able to\nprocess the response. This is an unrecoverable error. SOAP users should agree\nin advance on the collection of encodings that will be used in the\ntransactions. Ideally all transactions will use a Unicode encoding, such as\nUTF-8, since all XML processors are required to handle this encoding.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario E:</strong> Some encodings have more characters than are\nincluded in Unicode or use Private Use characters.

            "content": "All,\nThis is a draft of text for Section 2 in the new outline.\nText in curly braces is instruction and not to be included.\nAndrea\n\n2. Introduction to Web Services\n\nThis section contains a \"framework\" or outline for understanding \ninternational issues in Web services.\n\nThe framework is based on the Web Services Architecture document [WSA], \nwhich defines a service as follows: \"A service is a set of actions that \nform a coherent whole from the point of view of service providers and \nservice requesters. A requester entity is a legal entity that wishes to \nmake use of a provider entity's Web service. It will use a requester \nagent to exchange messages with the provider entity's provider agent. \nThe provider agent has one or more services available to it, that it can \ninvoke in behalf of the requester agent.\"\n\nThere are some important standards associated with Web services. Simple \nObject Access Protocol (SOAP) describes the protocol used for \ncommunication with a Web service.  It is a 2-section document that \nconforms to XML specifications.  The first part of the document is the \nenvelope, essentially routing instructions for the body message that \nfollows.  The second part is the body message, which contains \ninformation the Web service requires for processing and/or a remote \nprocedure call.  SOAP documents can have attachments with header \ninformation in MIME format.  The SOAP document, like any XML file, may \ncontain a charset tag, which describes the data contained in that \nparticular document only.  An attachment can have data in a different \ncharset; that charset can be specified in the MIME header Content-type. \n  For language specification, SOAP documents can contain xml:lang tags \nas specified in the XML standard [XML].  A SOAP attachment's language \ncan be indicated in the MIME header Content-language.\n\nWeb Services Description Language (WSDL) [WSDL-V12] is an XML-conformant \nlanguage used to describe the information necessary for calling and \nusing a Web service.\n\nWeb services can be found by searching a Universal Description, \nDiscovery, and Integration [UDDI] registry.  UDDI entries describe the \navailable service and point to the Web Service Description (WSD) via a \nURI.  The Web Service Description is typically written in WSDL, and it \ndocuments the mechanics of the message exchange between a requester and \na provider.\n\nThese standards work together as shown in the following scenario:\n\n{diagram here, modified version of the old 2.1 Overview diagram}\n\n    1.  The requester agent locates a suitable provider agent, usually \nrequiring human intervention. This can be accomplished through UDDI, but \nalso can be accomplished through other means. For example, the URL of \nthe provider agent may simply have been found in an advertisement somewhere.\n    2.  The provider agent makes available a WSD document, which is \nlikely written in WSDL.\n    3.  Using the information in the WSD, the requester agent can \nformulate a service request. This will be a SOAP message which is then \nsent to the provider agent to be acted upon.\n    4.  The provider agent after receiving the request will invoke the \nservice and get a response. The response can be the results of the \nservice or an indication that a fault occurred. Note that the \ninteraction between the provider agent and the service are independent \nof the Web Services framework and the design is left completely to the \nimplementors. The primary requirement is that the provider agent in turn \nbe able to formulate a response to return to the requester agent. This \nresponse must satisfy both the requirements and specifications of the \nWeb Services Architecture and the description of the WSD.\n    5.  If the service request was successfully executed, the provider \nagent will formulate a response message and send it to the requester agent.\n    6.  If the service request was erroneous, or the service could not \nbe completed for some reason, a fault message will be sent to the \nrequester agent.\n\nThe internationalization issues in Web services and as illustrated in \nthe framework fall into several categories which are common to all Web \nservices, regardless of the message exchange pattern used for a specific \nservice. In the section that follows it is assumed that the service, \nprovider and requester agents, and data structures (semantics) follow \nbest practices in internationalization and data structuring. Implicit in \nthese descriptions is the expectation that data structures use XML \nSchema types to create locale-neutral data structures.\n\nSome services may be implemented that do not follow these strictures for \nreasons having to do with legacy system implementation or other \nrestriction. These cases are dealt with in usage scenarios later in this \ndocument.\n\n{add text about MEPs and SOAP Features somewhere in this section?}\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi all,\n\nfirstly my apologies to everyone for the tardiness of the q and a, been \nswamped lately. So, unfortunately, here is a last minute draft. I don't \nhave the templates on this computer so just sending it on as text. Will \nhave a power nap before the teleconfernece in four hours.\n\nAndrew\n\n===================\n\nQuestion\n\nHow do I apply different styles using CSS for different languages in a \nmultilingual document?\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nAlthough CSS2 provides langauge specific selectors, these selectors are \nnot widely supported by web browsers. It is neccessary to use more \ngeneric CSS selectors for applying different styles for differnet \nlanguages within a XHTML/HTML document.\n\nThe most efficient method is to use a CSS class or id selector. For \nexample, the sentence \"The Nuer language is Thok Nath\" could be marked \nup as:\n\n<p>The Nuer language is <span lang=\"ssa\" xml:lang=\"ssa\" \nclass=\"nuer\">Thok Nath</span></p>\n\nAnd a class .nuer could be defined in the stylesheet as\n\n.nuer {font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;} or alternatively, as\n\nspan.nuer {font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;}\n\n\nBackground:\n\nFor those interested, CSS2 provides the language psuedo-class selector \n:lang() and language attribute selectors to allow XHTML/HTML document \nauthors to specify rules for langauge specific  presentation..\n\nThe :lang() psuedo-class selector allows authors to specify rules that \nmatch languages. I could markup the sentence \"The Nuer refer to \nthemselves as Naath\" as\n\n<p xml:lang=\"en-AU\" lang=\"en-AU\">The Nuer refer to themselves as <span \nxml:lang=\"ssa\" lang=\"ssa\">Naath</span></p>\n\nIn order to display the English text in blue and the Nuer text in green, \nthe following rules could be used:\n\n:lang(en-AU) {color: blue;}\n:lang(ssa) {color: green;}\n\nThe selector :lang(en-AU) will only match elements that have a language \nvalue of  ???en-AU??? or have inherited that langauge value. If the css rule \nspecified :lang(en-US), the rule would not match our sample paragraph.\n\nAlternatively, we could make the language designation more general and \nuse the following rules:\n\n:lang(en) {color: blue;}\n:lang(ssa) {color: green;}\n\nThe rule for :lang(en) would math elements with a language value of \n???en???. It would also amtch more specific langauge specifications such as \nen-US and en-NZ.\n\nThe second method of specifying rules is to use attribute selectors. If \nI markup ???Ye???? loi rot Aboja??? as\n\n<p xml:lang=\"din\" lang=\"din\">Ye???? loi rot Aboja</p>\n\nI could write a rule matching the langauge attribute.\n\n*[lang=\"din\"] {font-style: italic; color: green;} This rule will match \nall elements that have a langauge attribute equal to ???din???.\n\nIf the XHTML/HTML markup was\n\n<div xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\">\n<p>The first line was <span xml:lang=\"din\" lang=\"din\">Ye???? loi rot \nAboja</span></p>\n</div>\n\nand I had two rules\n\np[lang=\"en\"] {color: blue;}\n*[lang=\"din\"] {font-style: italic; color: green;}\n\nOnly the second rule would match. The paragraph has no language \nattribute to match.\n\nThere is a significant difference between [lang=\"en\"] and [lang|=\"en\"]. \nThe first language selector will only match elements with an langauge \nattribute equal to ???en???, while the second selector will match any \nelement with a langauge attribute starting with ???en???. Therefore the \nsecond selector would match ???en-US???, ???en-HK??? or ???en-CA???.\n\nIt is important to note that not all web browsers can use langauge \nselectors and it is best to use more generic selectors in your CSS rules.\n\nBy the way\n\nI have used the ISO-639-2 language code ssa for Nuer. Nuer doesn't have \na unique ISO-639-2 language code. This is teh code for a group of \nlanguages: Nilo-Saharan (Other). Seven Nilo-Saharan languages have \nunique ISO-639-2 codes, while approximately 178 languages share the \ngeneric ssa langauge code. The Ethnologue lists the languages at \nhttp://www.ethnologue.com/show_iso639.asp?code=ssa.\n\nUseful links\nThe language pseudo-class: :lang\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#lang\n\nAttribute selectors\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#attribute-selectors\n\nClass selectors\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#class-html\n\nID selectors\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#id-selectors\n\n\n\n"

I'd like comments back on these, since they were not discussed in advance.\n\nFirst: I inserted a definition of \"language negotiation\" into the section on I18n/L10n (section 3). Tex should check out my additions, since he authored the rest of the content.

This makes the patterns easier to understand for newbies (since client influenced introduces all of the concepts like language negotiation, locale-affected, and so forth most naturally~~service determined and data driven are then special cases of a locale affected service).\n\nThird: I started on fixing the service determined example, but am not done yet.\n\nAction list is: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/ActionItemList.xml (yes, the XML version)\n\nNext meeting is Thursday SEND ME YOUR TEXT BEFORE THEN.\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

For example:\n\n     * \"The date provided, 12 November 2201, was too late.\"\n     * \"The argument 12345.678 was too large.\"\n     * \"The argument 12345,678- was too small.\"\n\nThe provider should format substitutions in each message according to the \nlanguage and locale of the message, not according to the locale of the provider \nor service. In the case of Language Neutral or Service Determined patterns, it \nmay not be possible to generate a message in the user's preferred language (or \nthe preference may not be available). In these cases, the message should follow \nthe language preference of the provider or service host.\n\nFor more information on locale related formatting, see I-022.\n\n--------------------------\n\nMy reasoning is this:  People are going to look at fault messages separately \nfrom SOAP messages, because they are often from different coding components with \ndifferent people working on them.  So I don't want to merge the fault message \nlocale-based formatting with data formatting.  But the data formatting example \nhas some additional information that they might want to take a look at to get a \nbetter concept.\n\nAndrea\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "I agree in general, Mark, but that's not the design of Web Services.\n\nThis is something we have been at pains to point out: Faults (the Web Service equivalent of a runtime error or exception) can only generate a text message, not a complex type (data structure) in the SOAP provided XML structure. These scenarios are our way of complaining about it (we corresponded about this previously, I think).\n\nFor example, a given service can have several \"outbound\" messages, some of which indicate success and some of which indicate an error of some kind (such as input out of range or record not found). These responses are under programmatic control of the service, please note, and can follow the pattern you describe in JITXL.\n\nBy contrast, a Fault is a runtime exception. It may be literally and exception thrown in the body of the service or it may be an error condition detected in the Provider (such as \"service not found\" or \"malformed input\"). As Andrea points out, Faults are different from SOAP messages indicating an error, because they can contain only a Reason element (a text element containing the human readable message).\n\nIn other words, the design of Web Services is such that all Faults are resolved to string where they occur at the level they occur.\n\nWhat you're describing is a service that ends normally and returns a processing-controlled error. This can be done with Web Services and we should probably add a scenario showing it.\n\nHowever, abnormal ends such as a thrown exception or an error detected at the Provider (rather than service) level--that is, errors not under control of the service's normal processing--are forced to return a Fault and these must be resolved to a natural language string as shown in the example at the level at which they occur. The string must be marked with xml:lang (yay!), but there is no default message, data structuring, or language negotiation provided. Hence the scenarios including I-008 and I-022.\n\nDoes that describe the problem more clearly?\n\nAddison P.

            "content": "Some points here:\n\nFirst, I think just in time localization (actually late localization)\nis great, and should be done wherever possible. However, changing\ntexts to translated versions (message localization) and formatting\nvarious kinds of values may behave differently on a network, and\nmay therefore (have to be) localized at different places.\n\nI have discussed this in my 'World Wide Localization' paper in\nPrague (http://www.w3.org/2003/Talks/0324WWL/paper.html).\nSee in particular \"3.5 Message Translation\". While the client\nin almost all cases will have code to format e.g. dates to\nhis/her liking, the chance that all the strings for all the\napplications the client is interacting with are available\non the client is not very high. This applies in general,\nbut in many ways even more so for faults, because they are\nusually unexpected, system-dependent messages.\n\n From our point of view, the ideal would be to have a list of\nfixed error codes (such as e.g. in HTTP). I think the general\nopinion on this in the SOAP community is that no list of codes\nwhatsoever could be comprehensive, and that therefore it was/is\nbetter to not even try. In view of localization issues, we might\nhave to make them try harder.\n\nAnother problem for JIT Localization is that while it can\npotentially reduce language/locale negotiation, it may introduce\nanother kind of negotiation on a higher level: negotiating where\nthe localization should be done. For formatting, that may not be\nnecessary, but for message localization, it may well be. This\nwould be a general problem, but for faults in particular, any kind\nof additional negotiation or network activity is a bad thing,\nbecause the fault may be due to a network problem in the first\nplace.\n\nAn alternative to simple error numbers would be more structured\nerror formats. Do we need such a format? Would it help? Could it\nbe used in other contexts? Are there similar formats already out\nthere?\n\nMark gave a very simple example:\n> > <error>someFault</error>\n> > <date>2004-04-14</date>\n> > <numberOfPages>1400</numberOfPages>\n\nI guess here 'someFault' may be an error number or a text.\nFor an error number, would it be better to have e.g. an URI\nthat points to a repository of localized messages, or some\nother indirection or identifier that allows world-wide uniqueness?\nFor a text, would it be good to have a format that distinguishes\ntext and data, e.g. like such:\n\n<message xml:lang='en'>The date provided,\n    <data xsi:type=\"xsd:date\" seq='1'>2201-11-12</data>,\n    was too late.</message>\n\n(the 'seq' attribute would serve to identify different data items,\nwhich might be in different order in translated text).\n\nAn example for a translated text format could then look like:\n\n<message-translation xml:lang='de'>Das eigegebene Datum,\n    <data-substitution seq='1' />, war zu spa\"t.</message-translation>\n\nOf course this is just a draft for a very simplified example.\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\nAt 21:22 04/04/12 -0700, Addison Phillips [wM] wrote:\n\n>I agree in general, Mark, but that's not the design of Web Services.\n>\n>This is something we have been at pains to point out: Faults (the Web \n>Service equivalent of a runtime error or exception) can only generate a \n>text message, not a complex type (data structure) in the SOAP provided XML \n>structure.

            "content": "Hm...\n\nThat strikes me as a pretty fancy windmill to tilt at... so what the heck.\n\nI agree that JITXL is a good thing that we want to promote. But I also recognize the problem inherent in \"fixing\" the Fault Reason text element. Let's take it in pieces.\n\n1. Provide an HTTP-like numbering scheme. This could possibly work for errors on the provider level (indicating the types of faults that a SOAP processor can detect), but not for lower level faults generated within services or during invocation. At the provider level those all look the same: the service failed. But at the service level there are all manner of possibilities (e.g. insert list of all Java classes that are 'instanceof Throwable' here).\n\n2. Provide structured messages. Actually, there is such a mechanism in WSDL and SOAP. It's the Interface Fault in WSDL, that is, a message that a service can send back with any structure you can describe with XML that is indicative of a fault within the service. Really this is what should be defined for any expected errors a service may emit (that is, if you write the service in Java and the method definition includes the keyword 'throws', then there should be an interface fault defined for each exception the method can throw and it can be JITXL in form, if only the developer can be induced to design it that way--enter WS-I18N with support for knowing what the ultimate and intermediary client locales are).\n\n3. Provide for the unexpected. This leaves the odd messages (Classloading issues, NullPointerExceptions, abends of all types) that generate faults not mapped to Interface Faults and which the Provider must handle somehow. Since the type isn't known in advance it may not even be possible to resolve the message to anything except a string. \n\nI can't tell you how much effort I've expended at webMethods getting developers to wrap all kinds of basic exception classes with JITXL wrappers (for example, in JMS all exceptions take a (message) string as a constructor argument, so you have to be clever to wrap the exceptions up cleanly). This is where our friend the Fault Reason text element comes in. If your services and provider support JITXL, you want to take client (and intermediary's) locale preferences and use them to resolve the exception to a human readable string when you do the 'catch'. But I don't see a super complex mechanism here, since generally it is too late to extract the information necessary (in a catch the original data structure is gone--buried in the service's thread of execution, whereas you're in the Provider's code at this point).\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20-patterns\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/#InterfaceFault_XMLRep\n\nAddison P.

            "content": "\"j2t-i0n-t2e-l10n\"\n\nOkay, I'm not proposing anything here. I'm pointing out that:\n\n1. We could try to go for enumerating and number the possible provider level errors. The HTTP example is a good one, but the number of errors enumerated for HTTP is actually not that large. LDAP and SMTP are examples of the monster getting loose. To make the proposal someone would have to try to enumerate the number of fault states, define the mechanism for adding more, and so forth. It might be possible: no one has looked to my knowledge.\n\n2. The middle section was to show that there is a mechanism already in place for the kinds of things Mark is talking about, although it suffers from requiring the developer to think in terms of j2t-i0n-t2e-l10n at design time. Really we ought to add a usage scenario for that, since the temptation is to resolve the faulty bits to a string in the service and be done with it. \n\n3. The much-maligned fault reason text element is something that we need to deal with carefully. It may not be possible to fix the mechanism outright for the reasons I tried to demonstrate (all the solutions require big changes to the underlying implementations on the service level, which is a big non-starter), but having the client and intermediary locales available at least lets you try to (I give up) j23-or-22n the messages into the appropriate languages (if available) at the provider level. Okay, the intermediaries can't re-resolve any more, but if the locale preferences chained back originally this isn't as big an issue. It is the equivalent of the web server formatting numbers and such like in a Web page before serving it. JITXL for me means \"as late as reasonable\", which isn't always all the way on the client or even on the server closest to the client in a distributed system. It's just as late as it reasonable--as close to both the resources *and* client as possible.\n\nOne more thing: of course there are Out-In and Out-only message exchange patterns where there isn't a client locale becuase the service starts the MEP, but these patterns don't allow for the Out message to be a fault, I believe.\n\nIOW, this is more complex than it looks and fault reason text might not actually be fixable in a JITXL way, but at least we can show that it can be done *better* (which I think we do).\n\nMake sense? Probably not, because my head hurts re-reading the message.\n\nAddison \n\nAddison P.

            "subject": "4.16 Transport",
            "content": "Lots of modification should happen to this section, but I am not the right \nperson to make them all.\nSomeone at the F2F (Tex maybe?) had a lot more relevant information on FTP than \nI do.  I'm happy to write it up if you give me the info or a pointer.\n\nI am not very happy with my intro - comments, changes, rewrites welcome.\n\nI think 4.16.4 \"IRIs, URIs, and fun stuff\" would be better written by Martin.  I \ncould take a shot at the \"fun stuff\" part ;-}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n4.16 Transports\n\nWeb services may use a variety of transport technologies and protocols.  Many of \nthese have parameters defined for data identification.  These parameters are \nnecessary for proper processing of international data.  The specifics of several \ntransport protocols are discussed in this section.\n\n4.16.1 HTTP Accept-Language\n{Andrea's note: what about Content-Language?  And a blurb on Content-Type is \nadded below.  Maybe we should call this section \"HTTP\".}\n\nThe HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) is often used for Web service message\ntransport.  HTTP contains some header fields which are useful for identifying\nsender preferences and capabilities.  One of those fields is Accept-Language.\n\nAccept-Language takes one or more language identifiers in RFC3066 (or its\nreplacement) format as its parameters.  Each language identifier can have a\nquality value which gives a relative priority.  Here is an example:\n\n{Andrea's note:  the below should be set off in the example format, or indented \nand in a different font, or something}\nAccept-Language: zh-cn, fr-ch;q=0.8, fr;q=0.7\n\nThe above could be read as \"Simplified Chinese is preferred, but Swiss French is\nacceptable, as are other types of French.\"  There is more information about the\nhandling of Accept-Language in the HTTP 1.1 specification.\n\nA Web service requester using HTTP can include an Accept-Language field to\nindicate the languages preferred.  The provider can then take that information\nand use it to return human-readable data in the appropriate language.\n\n{Andrea's note: I put the below paragraph in because I think it bears mentioning}\nThe charset of the data can also be specified as a parameter of the Content-Type \nheader.  However, it is better to specify the SOAP document charset inside the \ndocument itself, rather than to rely on the transport mechanism to be the sole \nmechanism for identifying the charset.  If the charset specified in HTTP doesn't \nagree with the charset inside the document, then the receiver must make a \ndecision on how to resolve the problem.\n\n4.16.2 FTP\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a simple transport mechanism that can be used\nfor Web service documents.  The main international consideration in using FTP is\nto specify the representation type as I (Image), allowing 8-bit values to pass\nunchanged through the transfer.\n\nFile names, path names, and character encoding issues may intrude here.\n\n4.16.3 SMTP\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) has no particular provisions for \ninternational data.  SMTP itself is limited to 7-bit data, but can transport \n8-bit data.  Its main restriction is an 8-bit gateway; that is, encodings such \nas UTF-16 and UTF-32 may not be successfully transmitted and should be avoided.\n\n4.16.3.1 MIME Tags\n\nMultipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) tags are necessary for a multipart \nSOAP request, for example, a SOAP message with an attachment.  MIME contains a \nnumber of headers which may be used for international data.\n\n{somewhere we need to reference RFCs 2045-9, maybe as a MIME reference in the \nreference section}\n\nMIME can be useful for identifying the charset of attachments which do not \nidentify their own charset inside the attachment.  Examples of such attachments \nare plain text documents which cannot contain a charset tag and legacy markup \ndocuments which do not contain a charset tag by omission.  If the attachment \ncontains an internal charset tag, the MIME charset parameter should be omitted \nto avoid an inadvertent mismatch.\n\nMIME can also contain a Content-Language tag.  While it is better to indicate \nthe document language inside the document itself, sometimes it isn't possible. \nFor example, if there is an image attachment which contains embedded text, the \nContent-Language header can provide the language id.\n\nSee the example in 4.5.2 Character Coding of Attachments.\n{Andrea's note:  add the following line to the attachments example in 4.5.2 in \nthe attachment MIME headers after Content-Type -\n\nContent-Language: fr\n\nThis avoids having to make a separate example which would be very similar.}\n\n4.16.4 IRIs, URIs, and fun stuff\n{Martin's text here :-) }\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "All,\nLast review before re-chartering.  Some nitpicks, some real stuff.  You decide \nwhich is which :-P\n\n--------------------------------\nIn the Introduction, re-punctuate \"The W3C Internationalization Working Group, \nWeb Services Task Force, was ... \" to \"The W3C Internationalization Working \nGroup - Web Services Task Force, was ... \" or leave the hyphen out entirely.\n\nNeed space after period here \" ... Usage Scenarios document [WSUS].Some of ... \" \n(might be an artifact of the HTML SS).\n\n2.1 \"A SOAP Feature (see [SOAP-Feature], Section 5) that provides the Web \nservice provider international ... \" => change \"provides\" to \"gives\" or some \nother similar, less-repetitious verb.  In fact, rewrite the whole paragraph, \nsomething like:\n\n\"Requirement: A SOAP Feature (see [SOAP-Feature], Section 5) that gives the Web \nservice provider international contextual information, such as locale, language, \nor other culturally linked preferences.  The information may be related to the \nrequester's preferences or to the data itself.  The provider can then use this \ninformation to tailor the language, invocation, or operation of services or the \noperation of the provider, for example, language selection in the generation of \nFaults.\"\n\nThis begs the question, should we provide more information in the Problem \nstatement and shorten the requirement to just the actual requirement, e.g.\n\n\"Requirement: A SOAP Feature (see [SOAP-Feature], Section 5) that gives the Web \nservice provider international contextual information, such as locale, language, \nor other culturally linked preferences.  The information may be related to the \nrequester's preferences or to the data itself.\"\n\n2.3  Another rewrite:\n\n\"Problem Statement: Service providers need a way to include information to \nindicate the behavior of a specific instance of a locale-affected Web service or \nto differentiate instances of the same service. For example, Binding A executes \nin French, Binding B executes in Japanese, and Binding C attempts to match the \nuser's preferences.\"\n\n\"Requirement: A WSDL feature that allows a service to describe a \"locale \nexecution policy\" for a service or a binding of a service, including any \nadditional derived information of interest to users of the service.  This allows \nusers the select the service and binding that most closely matches their needs \nor to tailor the operation of the service via header information. This feature \nmust allow services to describe one or more languages or locales available for a \nspecific service and enable a runtime user choice (language/locale negotiation) \nwhen that is appropriate. It must also provide a way to indicate that a specific \nservice always executes using specific international settings or returns data in \na specific language.\"\n\nAgain, philosophically, should we load up more info in the problem statement and \nreduce the size of the requirement statement, making it more succinct:\n\n\"Requirement: A WSDL feature that allows a service to describe a \"locale \nexecution policy\" for a service or a binding of a service, including any \nadditional derived information of interest to users of the service. This feature \nmust allow services to describe one or more languages or locales available for a \nspecific service and enable a runtime user choice (language/locale negotiation) \nwhen that is appropriate. It must also provide a way to indicate that a specific \nservice always executes using specific international settings or returns data in \na specific language.\"\n\n2.4 Can we reduce the parentheses a bit?  I see the point in using them here, \nbut using too many parenthetical comments makes for rough reading.\n\n2.5 Should there be any mention of CLDR (or whatever it's called these days)?\n\n2.6 Can we be more forceful and specific other than saying that the requirement \nis to develop requirements?\n\n\"Requirement: A Web service discovery mechanism which includes international \ninformation, such as descriptions in multiple languages and available locales \nfor processing.  This includes non-W3C standards such as UDDI.\"\n\nOr some such.\n\nI can't think of anything to add to the doc at the moment.\n\nAndrea\n-- \nI have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. \nMy wish has come true.

(that is, it was not in \nerror) ... the provider agent will now attempt to invoke the service itself.\"\n  - change of tense, would be better as -\n    \"If the SOAP message is decoded successfully, ... (that is, it is not in \nerror) ... the provider agent attempts to invoke the service itself.\"\n\n\n3.1 What are Internationalization and Localization?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nsubtitle \"Do you even care?\"  - just kidding\n\nnoted \"web services\" - assume doc will be scanned for all occurrences of \"web \nservices in any capitalization configuration and adjusted to the prescribed \"Web \nservices\"\n\n\"Natural language text processing (parsing, spell checking, grammar checking are \nexamples of these)\" =>\n\"Natural language text processing; for example, parsing, spell checking, grammar \nchecking.\"\n\n\"Alternate Calendars ... \" => \"Alternate calendars ... \"\n\nAdd period after \"Tax or regulatory regime\", \"Currency\", \"...and many more\", or \ntake the periods off the ends of the other bullet points.  Add a space after the \nellipses in \"...and many more\".\n\nIs there a W3C convention for referring to keywords and constants in \nprogramming/markup languages?  I think we should set off \"lang\" and \"xml:lang\" \nin the following statement \"HTML for example uses the lang attribute to indicate \nthe language of segments of content. XML uses the xml:lang attribute for the \nsame purpose.\"\n\nMore on setting off a term \"In this document, we will use the term locale as the \nname for this shorthand indicator for a user's particular set of international \npreferences.\" => 'locale' should be set off in some way, via underline or \nitalics or bold or quotes or something.  We should be consistent, though, about \nhow we set off a type of term.  In \" ... this shorthand indicator for a user's \nparticular set of international preferences.\" change 'for' to 'of'.\n\nIn the definition of Localization, why is \"Locale\" capitalized?  I don't see a \nneed for it.  And again in the 2nd paragraph of Language Negotiation definition.\n\n2nd paragraph of Language Negotiation definition - \" ... the locale of \"en-US\" \n... \" - 2 things, should we leave the hyphen as opposed to the underscore even \nthough that convention is not yet established or standardized, and whatever we \nuse, should it be set off by double quote marks?  back to establishing \nconventions for setting off types of terms.\n\nSame paragraph \"prefered\" => \"preferred\", \"infered\" => \"inferred\", \"vs\" => \"vs.\" \n- assume doc will be spell-checked.\n\n3.1 last paragraph, change \"and so forth\" to \"and others\" or \"and other \nentities\" or something like that\n\n3.1.1 Relationship of Locale to Natural Language\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\" ...  in the absence of other information, the language parameter can be \nhelpful in guessing a relevant locale.\" - remove comma after 'information'\n\nSo, you _are_ deleting the old block, right?\n\n3.1.2 I-025: Specifying and Exchanging International Preferences in Web Services\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"Web services, by contrast, must ... \" =>\n\"Web services, in contrast, must ...\"\n\nExpand \"RPC\" the first time it's used, then use the acronym.\n\n\"There is no way to associate the string argument with locale functionality in \nthe provider or available in the transport.\" =>\n\"There is no way to associate the string argument with locale functionality \navailable in the provider or in the transport.\" - hmm, locale functionality \navailable in the transport, is that even possible?  Identification, yes, \nfunctionality?\n\nNeed spaces after all the colons, e.g. \"Description Scenario B:The ... \" => \n\"Description Scenario B: The ... \"\n\n\"A legacy (existing) function ... \" =>\n\"An existing function ... \"\n\nin Description Scenario C, \"Accept-Langauge\" => \"Accept-Language\"\n\"Existing locale negotiation mechanisms (such as Accept-Langauge in many \napplication servers) rely on the container (formerly an Application server, but \nin this case the service provider) to populate this information. \" =>\n\"Existing locale negotiation mechanisms, such as Accept-Language in many \napplication servers, rely on the container (formerly an Application server, but \nin this case the service provider) to populate this information. \"\n\nCan we do something about the double colons in the Scenario As?  maybe replace \nthe second colon with a dash or something.\n\n\"Scenario A: Different Locale Identifiers: Sender sends a request to a Provider \nand wants a specific locale and uses its identifier for that.\" =>\n\"Scenario A: Different Locale Identifiers - Sender sends a request to a Provider \nwanting a specific locale and uses its identifier for that.\"\n\n\" ... but the specific operation is slightly different than the sender's \nimplementation and ... \"=>\n\" ... but the specific operation is slightly different from the sender's \nimplementation and ... \"\n\n\" ...

My \nguess is that it's pretty much Greek to anyone outside of i18n.  I think we \nshould clarify the example, e.g. \"For example, Microsoft Windows' Locale C? ID \n(LCID) is not the same as a Java locale identifier.\" or something like that\n\nI'd like to pull the examples out of parentheses and give them more clarity in \ngeneral in this section.\n\nScenario D needs a cleanup, I'm not sure exactly what is the intention so I \ncan't rewrite it.\n\n\"Scendario E\" => \"Scenario E\"  (Addison needs more sleep)  also another cleanup \nneeded.\n\nScenario F needs cleanup.\n\nFigure shows up in wrong spot, at least on Netscape 7.1 - it should be after \nScenario A++ (the extra smart scenario)\n\n3.2.1 Textual vs. Binary Representations\n----------------------------------------\n\n\" ... binary representations and textual represenations.\" =>\n\" ... binary and textual representations.\"\n\n\n\"As an example, a floating-point number is represented in some binary format \ninternal to an application, and is converted to a text ual format, with \nappropriate localization formatting (e.g. using a decimal comma rather than a \ndecimal point for many European locales), for output to the user.\" =>\n\"As an example, a floating-point number is represented in some binary format \ninternal to an application, and is converted to text with appropriate \nlocalization formatting for output to the user; for instance, the decimal in the \nformatted text may be represented by a comma, rather than a period.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, most of them were carefully designed to be locale-independent, \nand are intended to be used locale-independent.\" =>\n\"Nevertheless, most of them were carefully designed to be locale-independent, \nand are intended to be used in a locale-independent manner.\"  or something \nsimilar which is not \"Me Tarzan, you Jane\" sounding\n\nNote in the 2nd paragraph, the word \"date\" is set off via a change to a Courier \ntype font - we could exploit this convention throughout the doc for keywords and \nconstants.  Also note, the ISO standard here is written ISO 8601, that is, with \na space after 'ISO'.  We should be consistent in the way we write the ISO \nstandard names.  Same goes for RFCs, but RFCs don't have to be consistent with ISOs.\n\n3.2.2 Locale-dependent XML Schema datatypes\n-------------------------------------------\n\nstill need the Ethiopic example here\n\nalso, we have to decide if we're sticking with titlecase rules for section heads \nand apply it to all of them.\n\n\n\nI'll put the rest of the comments in a separate mail (or mails)\n\nAndrea\n\n\n\n"

So far I have five demos running. You can invoke each service using any SOAP client, including the public one at http://www.soapclient.com/soapclient\n\nThe URLs for the WSDL are:\n\nhttp://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/getTime\nhttp://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/serviceDetermined\nhttp://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/userInfluenced\nhttp://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/i18ndemo\nhttp://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/MoreDeadly\n\nThe first one is our locale-neutral example.\nThe second one is a service determined example: it returns whether a given date is the first day of the week (Locale == USA, TimeZone == America/Los_Angeles)\nThe third one is a user influenced version of the second one. The not-well-named string arguments are an RFC3066 language ID (for locale) and an Olsen/Java TimeZone ID (for timezone). Bad input leads to the USA and GMT.\n\nThe last two have a hodge-podge of stuff in them. I won't doc them here. My goal is to go back and add some more demos for each of the Usage Scenarios so that I can generate the SOAP and WSDL for use as reference material. Actually invoking the services is pretty cool as a demo too.\n\nThanks,\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

E.g.\nvalue1<sep/>value2<sep/>value3...\n\nThat's what XML is for.\n\n>I believe there may be a lot of data using controls, and as with this group,\n>people may not have time to develop better solutions other than writing the\n>data out as NCRs.\n\nIf they want to use XML, they should at least try to use it the\nright way. And we should help them understand what the right\nway is. They can always decide to do something else on their own.\n\n\n>3) So because of 2, I claim if XML is for data interchange, support for\n>interchange of controls is needed.\n\nYour example doesn't show that. XML has a perfect way of exchanging\nstructured data.\n\nAlso, in some way, the use case above looks like they just needed\n*any* character. Maybe converting it to a PUA character would\nbe another solution (but I don't like that, either).\n\n\n>I can agree the needs are exotic.\n>You can argue that the data should instead be cleaned up, but that is\n>impractical in some cases.\n>In any event, it is worthwhile to let people know what is and is not doable in\n>*ML.\n>I don't mind giving more emphasis to cleaning up the data.\n\nYes, I think we should do that.\n\n\n>I also don't mind emphasizing that control codes are to be avoided, and are\n>bad for scalability and on the web.\n\nYes, very good.\n\n\n>I would disagree with saying never use controls in XML.\n\nI haven't said that.\n\n\n>I would presume the reason support for controls as NCRs was added, is because\n>some needs were identified for supporting controls.\n>\n>\n>4) separate rows for NL. I agree.\n>\n>5) encoding. I believe what we said, is that if the data is in fact binary,\n>encoding is an option.\n>Essentially, if it is binary, it is not an i18n issue.\n\nThe paragraph that mentions base64 does not say anything about\nthe data being binary, and the problems for i18n if the data\nis textual. If you have discussed that, and it's going to be\nupdated, that's good.\n\nSome more points:\n\n- For XML 1.1, clearly say that it is not yet a Recommendation.\n- If possible, don't use notes. In most cases, they can be\n   replaced with a direct link.\n- In note 4, change \"For example, eacute is the Character Entity Reference\"\n   to \"For example, &eacute; is the Character Entity Reference\"\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\n\n>Richard, if you want to finish the changes you were going to make, you can\n>address Martin's comments or pass it back to me and I'll address them.\n>tex\n>\n>\n>Martin Duerst wrote:\n> >\n> > Hello Tex,\n> >\n> > Some more comments on your Q&A.\n> >\n> > Overall, I think that the answer is much too long.

E.g.\nvalue1<sep/>value2<sep/>value3...\n\nThat's what XML is for.\n\n>I believe there may be a lot of data using controls, and as with this group,\n>people may not have time to develop better solutions other than writing the\n>data out as NCRs.\n\nIf they want to use XML, they should at least try to use it the\nright way. And we should help them understand what the right\nway is. They can always decide to do something else on their own.\n\n\n>3) So because of 2, I claim if XML is for data interchange, support for\n>interchange of controls is needed.\n\nYour example doesn't show that. XML has a perfect way of exchanging\nstructured data.\n\nAlso, in some way, the use case above looks like they just needed\n*any* character. Maybe converting it to a PUA character would\nbe another solution (but I don't like that, either).\n\n\n>I can agree the needs are exotic.\n>You can argue that the data should instead be cleaned up, but that is\n>impractical in some cases.\n>In any event, it is worthwhile to let people know what is and is not doable in\n>*ML.\n>I don't mind giving more emphasis to cleaning up the data.\n\nYes, I think we should do that.\n\n\n>I also don't mind emphasizing that control codes are to be avoided, and are\n>bad for scalability and on the web.\n\nYes, very good.\n\n\n>I would disagree with saying never use controls in XML.\n\nI haven't said that.\n\n\n>I would presume the reason support for controls as NCRs was added, is because\n>some needs were identified for supporting controls.\n>\n>\n>4) separate rows for NL. I agree.\n>\n>5) encoding. I believe what we said, is that if the data is in fact binary,\n>encoding is an option.\n>Essentially, if it is binary, it is not an i18n issue.\n\nThe paragraph that mentions base64 does not say anything about\nthe data being binary, and the problems for i18n if the data\nis textual. If you have discussed that, and it's going to be\nupdated, that's good.\n\nSome more points:\n\n- For XML 1.1, clearly say that it is not yet a Recommendation.\n- If possible, don't use notes. In most cases, they can be\n   replaced with a direct link.\n- In note 4, change \"For example, eacute is the Character Entity Reference\"\n   to \"For example, &eacute; is the Character Entity Reference\"\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\n\n>Richard, if you want to finish the changes you were going to make, you can\n>address Martin's comments or pass it back to me and I'll address them.\n>tex\n>\n>\n>Martin Duerst wrote:\n> >\n> > Hello Tex,\n> >\n> > Some more comments on your Q&A.\n> >\n> > Overall, I think that the answer is much too long.

            "content": "Hi Andrea,\n\nThanks for the comments. I made changes as noted below... some of the\nchanges were more extensive than your suggestions. These are as noted. New\nversion online.\n\n> 4.1.1\n> ------\n> Switching back and forth from \"locale neutral\" to \"language neutral\" is\n> confusing and will make people think that they are\n> interchangeable.  If we want\n> to take on both cases, we should talk about them both and explain\n> the the terms.\n\nThis was sloppy. Original:\n\n<quot>A language neutral service generally is one that executes in the same\nway regardless of the current runtime locale or user preferences regarding\nlanguage. This implies that all or most strings embedded in the service are\nnot human readable. This is, by far, the most common pattern. In a language\nor locale neutral service, external factors do not alter the way the service\nperforms. An example of this would be a service that adds two integers\ntogether: 2+2 = 4 in most every locale.\n\nLanguage neutral services, being the default, do not generally announce\nthemselves in their service contracts, although (other scenarios apply\nhere).\n</quot>\n\nI would propose this as a replacement:\n\n<quot>\n<p>A locale neutral service is one that executes in the same\nway regardless of the locale applied to the service. An example of this\nwould be a service that adds two integers together: 2+2 = 4 in every\nlocale.</p>\n\n<p>This suggests that strings embedded in the service are not human readable\nand that data processed by the service is not being handled in a culturally\nsensitive way. </p>\n\n<p>Locale neutral services, being the default, do not generally need to\nannounce\ntheir locale  in their service contracts, although information about the\nlocale\nor language preference of the requester may still be useful in a variety of\ncases.</p>\n</quot>\n\n\n>\n> 4.1.1.1\n> -------\n> We should clarify that this example implies there are no returned\n> error messages or responses with any verbiage.\n\nI think we can leave out error messages, since these are dealt with\nelsewhere. I modified the example to make the \"no text\" point clear, as\nfollows:\n\n<p>For example, the service response would contain a single value\n'currentTime' using the current\nUTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time in the ISO 8601 format: hh:mm:ss.sss,\nmandated by the\n<xspecref href=\"...\">time</xspecref> datatype in  XML Schema\nPart 2: Datatypes <bibref ref=\"XMLS-2\"/>.</p>\n\nThis makes it clear that the response in the example does not have a text\nfield. (Okay, it doesn't say \"no text\", but it is an example of a service\nwhich has no text... is that good enough?)\n\n>\n> 4.1.2\n> -----\n>\n> \"This may be due to how the service's code is written, how the\n> provider is\n> configured ...\" => awk, how about\n> \"This may be due to the way the service's code is written, the provider's\n> configuration ...\", or,\n> \"This may be due to the way the service's code is written, the\n> way the provider\n> is configured ...\"\n\nAgreed. Changed these paragraphs as follows:\n\n<p>In the Service Determined pattern, the service provides a specific\nlocalized set of behavior determined prior to the request.</p>\n\n<p>That is, the service does something in a culturally sensitive or\nlocale affected way. The locale used in this processing is inherent\nin how the service is implemented or configured. For example, it\nmight be the default locale of the system where the service is running. </p>\n\n<p>It may also be a configuration option of the service, provider,\nor provider agent. One example of this would be a service that provides\nseveral\nbindings, each with a separate locale.</p>\n\n<p>The preferences of the requester do not influence how the service\nexecutes and may not influence aspects of the service such as the\nlanguage of messages returned and so forth.</p>\n>\n> 4.1.2.1\n> -------\n> Note:  Alcohol is a risky example, due to cultural attitudes to\n> alcohol in some\n> parts of the world.  I suggest something less controversial, say, office\n> objects, or vegetarian food items, or simple household objects.\n> How about\n> noodles?  The US item could be \"egg noodles\", the German one\n> \"Sp?tzle\", and the\n> Japanese one \"udon\". (Can you tell I'm hungry?)\n\nThis is an awful example: it is too large for the purpose it has been given.\nBefore I SAR beers with noodles, we should discuss replacing it altogether\nwith a smaller example.\n\n>\n> \"... part number, quantity, language, description, size, list price.\"\n>                                                          ^and\n\nDone.\n\n> \"If all of the information was maintained ...\" =>\n> \"If all of the information is maintained ...\" or, less preferable,\n> \"If all of the information were maintained ...\" (yes, English has a\n> subjunctive/conditional tense)\n\nDone.\n>\n> \"budweiser\" => \"Budweiser\" (but again I strongly advise against\n> alcohol in any\n> example)\n> \"kirin\" => \"Kirin\"\n\nDone.\n>\n> \" ... it's capabilities are limited ...\" => \"its\"\n\nDone.\n>\n> \" ... the service could still not offer product from ... \"\n>                                                 ^s\n\nDone.\n>\n> 4.1.3.1\n> -------\n>\n> \" ... with Japanese language description.\"\n>                                          ^s\n\nDone.\n>\n> \"web\" => \"Web\" (throughout doc)\n\nDone.

Vine <andrea.vine@Sun.COM>\nReply-To: andrea.vine@Sun.COM\nOrganization: Sun Microsystems\nTo: I18n WSTF <public-i18n-ws@w3.org>\n\n\nLots of modification should happen to this section, but I am not the right\nperson to make them all.\nSomeone at the F2F (Tex maybe?) had a lot more relevant information on FTP than\nI do.  I'm happy to write it up if you give me the info or a pointer.\n\nI am not very happy with my intro - comments, changes, rewrites welcome.\n\nI think 4.16.4 \"IRIs, URIs, and fun stuff\" would be better written by Martin.  I\ncould take a shot at the \"fun stuff\" part ;-}\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n4.16 Transports\n\nWeb services may use a variety of transport technologies and protocols.  Many of\nthese have parameters defined for data identification.  These parameters are\nnecessary for proper processing of international data.  The specifics of several\ntransport protocols are discussed in this section.\n\n4.16.1 HTTP Accept-Language\n{Andrea's note: what about Content-Language?  And a blurb on Content-Type is\nadded below.  Maybe we should call this section \"HTTP\".}\n\nThe HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) is often used for Web service message\ntransport.  HTTP contains some header fields which are useful for identifying\nsender preferences and capabilities.  One of those fields is Accept-Language.\n\nAccept-Language takes one or more language identifiers in RFC3066 (or its\nreplacement) format as its parameters.  Each language identifier can have a\nquality value which gives a relative priority.  Here is an example:\n\n{Andrea's note:  the below should be set off in the example format, or indented\nand in a different font, or something}\nAccept-Language: zh-cn, fr-ch;q=0.8, fr;q=0.7\n\nThe above could be read as \"Simplified Chinese is preferred, but Swiss French is\nacceptable, as are other types of French.\"  There is more information about the\nhandling of Accept-Language in the HTTP 1.1 specification.\n\nA Web service requester using HTTP can include an Accept-Language field to\nindicate the languages preferred.  The provider can then take that information\nand use it to return human-readable data in the appropriate language.\n\n{Andrea's note: I put the below paragraph in because I think it bears mentioning}\nThe charset of the data can also be specified as a parameter of the Content-Type\nheader.  However, it is better to specify the SOAP document charset inside the\ndocument itself, rather than to rely on the transport mechanism to be the sole\nmechanism for identifying the charset.  If the charset specified in HTTP doesn't\nagree with the charset inside the document, then the receiver must make a\ndecision on how to resolve the problem.\n\n4.16.2 FTP\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a simple transport mechanism that can be used\nfor Web service documents.  The main international consideration in using FTP is\nto specify the representation type as I (Image), allowing 8-bit values to pass\nunchanged through the transfer.\n\nFile names, path names, and character encoding issues may intrude here.\n\n4.16.3 SMTP\n\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) has no particular provisions for\ninternational data.  SMTP itself is limited to 7-bit data, but can transport\n8-bit data.  Its main restriction is an 8-bit gateway; that is, encodings such\nas UTF-16 and UTF-32 may not be successfully transmitted and should be avoided.\n\n4.16.3.1 MIME Tags\n\nMultipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) tags are necessary for a multipart\nSOAP request, for example, a SOAP message with an attachment.  MIME contains a\nnumber of headers which may be used for international data.\n\n{somewhere we need to reference RFCs 2045-9, maybe as a MIME reference in the\nreference section}\n\nMIME can be useful for identifying the charset of attachments which do not\nidentify their own charset inside the attachment.  Examples of such attachments\nare plain text documents which cannot contain a charset tag and legacy markup\ndocuments which do not contain a charset tag by omission.  If the attachment\ncontains an internal charset tag, the MIME charset parameter should be omitted\nto avoid an inadvertent mismatch.\n\nMIME can also contain a Content-Language tag.  While it is better to indicate\nthe document language inside the document itself, sometimes it isn't possible.\nFor example, if there is an image attachment which contains embedded text, the\nContent-Language header can provide the language id.\n\nSee the example in 4.5.2 Character Coding of Attachments.\n{Andrea's note:  add the following line to the attachments example in 4.5.2 in\nthe attachment MIME headers after Content-Type -\n\nContent-Language: fr\n\nThis avoids having to make a separate example which would be very similar.}\n\n4.16.4 IRIs, URIs, and fun stuff\n{Martin's text here :-) }\n\n\n\n\n\n-- \nI have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. \nMy wish has come true. I no longer know how to use my telephone.\n-Bjarne Stroustrup, designer of C++ programming language (1950- )\n\n\n\n"

I envision a \ndiscussion of recommending XML format (in non-recommendation verbiage) and \ntalking about i18n-related information within such a document.

However, there \nis no standard parameter to indicate the time zone.  Locales are not useful for \ndetermining time zone because there can be many time zones within a given locale.\n\nScenario A:  A Web service returns the current time of a city listed as part of \nthe request.  The requester sends the name of a city (with an xml:lang tag) and \nthe provider returns the current time in that city formatted in ISO 8601 format \n(hh:mm:ss).\n\nScenario B:  A Web service takes a date/time value in ISO 8601 format \n(yyyymmddThhmm+hhmm) and the name of a city with an xml:lang tag, and returns \nthe value converted to the specified city's time.\n\nScenario C:  As a sub-process of a calendar service, a Web service inspects \nmultiple calendars looking for mutually available time slots.  The requester \nprovides a span of time in ISO 8601 format (yyyymmddThhmm+hhmm) using a start \ntime and an end time.  The inspected calendars store information about their \ntime zones.  The service returns a series of time spans in the ISO 8601 format.\n\n\n-- \nI have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. \nMy wish has come true.

            "content": "Notes:  Scenario A is big and ugly.  It might make more sense to cut it down to \none of the sub-services.  I'm not sure if Scenarios B & C are what we're after. \n  I was trying to think of a legal example, and most seem too complex.\n\n6.7 Regimes\n\n6.7.1 Modeling Tax, Customs, Legal, and other Cross-Border and Cultural \nConsiderations\n\nTax, customs, legal, and similar matters are usually country-specific.  However, \nmuch of the types of processing involved are the same.  For example, many tax \ncalculations take a percentage or set of percentages of a given amount.  A set \nof Web services can work together to provide information for many countries, \navoiding code and process duplication.\n\nThere is more information needed in these types of processes than just the \ncountry identifier.  Language information is crucial for legal documents, and \nimportant for other regime-type operations as well.  For tax calculations, the \ncurrency of the incoming values as well as the currency of the result must be \nspecified.  Other cross-border services will likely require other types of \ninformation, such as address formats or some sort of legal status indicator.\n\nScenario A:  Web service A takes in the value of a sale, the currency used in \nthe sale and an optional currency preferred for the tax value, a language \nparameter, the name of the city, the province, state, county, and/or \nprincipality, and the country name.  Service A then calls a set of services, \ntranslating names into identifiers.  Service B takes in a city id, a monetary \nvalue, and a currency, then calculates city sales tax based on current tax \ntables it retrieves from other services; it returns the tax amount in the same \ncurrency.  Service C performs a similar function for taxes at the provincial, \nstate, county, and principality level.  It returns one or more values with tags \nas to which tax the value represents.  Likewise, Service D takes the country \nname and returns a series of values with tags.  Service A then takes the \nreturned values, converts them into the preferred currency (if provided), and \nreturns the values with identifying tags and the currency.\n\nScenario B:  An application provides ordering capabilities for a number of \nproducts, via a detailed choreography of Web services.  The products are known \nand categorized.  Web service X takes the country id of origin of the product, \nthe country id of the potential buyer, and the product category.  It looks up \nthe product category in a database and and determines whether it is legal to \nsell and/or to ship the product to the buyer.\n\nScenario C:  Web service M takes a country id, looks it up in a database, and \nreturn the driving rules for that country.\n\n-- \nI have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. \nMy wish has come true. I no longer know how to use my telephone.\n-Bjarne Stroustrup, designer of C++ programming language (1950- )\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "6.9 Transports\n\n6.9.1 HTTP Accept-Language\n\nThe HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) is often used for Web service message \ntransport.  HTTP contains some header fields which are useful for identifying \nsender preferences and capabilities.  One of those fields is Accept-Language.\n\nAccept-Language takes one or more language identifiers in RFC3066 (or its \nreplacement) format as its parameters.  Each language identifier can have a \nquality value which gives a relative priority.  Here is an example:\n\nAccept-Language: zh-cn, fr-ch;q=0.8, fr;q=0.7\n\nThe above could be read as \"Simplified Chinese is preferred, but Swiss French is \nacceptable, as are other types of French.\"  There is more information about the \nhandling of Accept-Language in the HTTP 1.1 specification.\n\nA Web service requester using HTTP can include an Accept-Language field to \nindicate the languages preferred.  The provider can then take that information \nand use it to return human-readable data in the appropriate language.\n\n{Andrea's questions:  do we need a scenario here?  Also, should we mention \nContent-Language, if only to say that it's better to tag the language inside the \ndoc?}\n\n6.9.2 FTP\n\nFile Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a simple transport mechanism that can be used \nfor Web service documents.  The main international consideration in using FTP is \nto specify the representation type as I (Image), allowing 8-bit values to pass \nunchanged through the transfer.\n\nFor more information on FTP representation types see RFC959.\n\n{Andrea's question:  Was that what we were intending here?  There isn't much \nmore to FTP from an i18n perspective.}\n\n6.9.3 SMTP\n\n{Andrea's note:  trying to slog through the SMTP RFCs to figure out what i18n \nconsiderations there are.

            "content": "Great idea!  Here's my first cut on 6.3 - Natural Language Searching\n\nCheers,\n\n       Mike____\n\n===============================\n\n\n      6.3 Natural Language Text Search\n\nInvariably, somewhere along the line, an actual human will use a client \napplication to look for something.  When that happens, services down the \nmay or may not understand the language of the client.  To accommodate \nthis, natural language processing is used.   The two primary cases are \nlanguage-neutral and language-specific.\n\n\n        6.3.1 Language-Neutral Natural Language Text Search\n\nMost search engines do not understand language, but do understand \npatterns and proximity.  Patterns refer to wildcards and whitespace for \nfull-text search.  However, many asian languages have no concept of \nwhitespace in most full text, and therefore may use a scheme where every \ncharacter can be considered to be a word.\n\n\n          Character form normalization\n\nFor language neutral applications, text should be normalized to only one \nform (such as base+combining character or all precomposed) according to \nUnicode Standard TR15 (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/) before \ncomparisons are made.\n\n\n          Catalog or Index in Multiple Languages\n\nCatalogs or indexes, if more than one language is to be supported should \ncontain language variants of keywords.  This can be populated \nautomatically, with translations done semi-automatically, using context \nto aid in creating the right alternate terms. \n \nThis is the ability to have one catalog or index item, with the \ndescription in many languages.  The service wants to be able to update \nprice and quantity in one place per item and have that reflected across \nall languages.   The client wants to search for items in their own \nlanguage. \n\nE.g., in the following business XML, a catalog item is defined as follows:\n\n    <elementtype name=\"Product\">\n        <model>\n            <sequence>\n              . . .\n         <element type=\"<ShortDescription.html>\" occurs=\"*\"/>\n         <element type=\"<LongDescription.html>\" occurs=\"*\"/>\n              . . .\n\n\nThe Descriptions can occur from zero to many times.  The Description is \ndefined as follows:\n\n    <elementtype name=\"ShortDescription\">\n         <model>\n                  <string/>\n         </model>\n         <attdef name=\"lang\" datatype=\"xmllang\" prefix=\"xml\">\n              <default>en</default>\n         </attdef>\n    </elementtype>\n\n \nYou should then be able to support the following:\n\n    <Product Type=\"Good\" SchemaCategoryRef=\"C43171803\">\n      <ProductID>154723-005</ProductID>\n      <Manufacturer PartnerRef=\"Acme Tools\"></Manufacturer>\n                       . . .\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"en\">Wrench</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"en_GB\">Spanner</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"da\">fladnoegle</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"es-ES\">llave abierta</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"es-MX\">llave inglesa</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"fr-FR\">clef ?? fourche</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"de\">Gabelschluessel</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"it\">chiave a forchetta</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"ja\">??????</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"ko\">?????????</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"nl\">vorkvormige sleutel</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"pt-PT\">chave fixa</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"pt-BR\">chave de boca</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"zh-CN\">??????</ShortDescription>\n      <ShortDescription xml:lang=\"zh-TW\">??????</ShortDescription>\n                       . . .\n    </Product>\n\n\n        6.3.2 Language-specific Natural Language Text Search\n\nMost search engines that have any linguistic characteristics are tuned \nto a specific language such as English, German,  or French.  This allows \ntechniques, such as stemming and ignoring stop-words to operate \naccording to the unique characteristics of the language it is operating \nin. \n\n\n          Keyword searching\n\nWhen searching for keywords,  language must be considered to resolve \nsome items such as abbreviations.  E.g., in the string, \"422 St. Jerome \nSt.\", \"St.\" could be either \"Saint\" or \"Street\". \n\n\n          Gender and plural variants\n\nNote that some terms have more than one form depending on the gender or \nplurality of the object.  As an example, \"Dr. Alvarez\" or \"Doctor \nAlvarez\" in English, could be either \"Dr\" or \"Dra\" for \"Doctor\" or \n\"Doctora\" in Spanish.  Therefore, to increase number of valid hits, in \nthe absence of context, a service should match all variants of a \nmatching term if translated to an alternate language.\n\n\n          Like clauses\n\nWhen operating in a specific language, further normalization may be \nrequired in addition to abbreviation expansion and character \nnormalization.  This is to accommodate variant spellings for the same \nword.  In German, for instance, \"D??rst\" should also return \"Duerst\"  to \nallow searching across legacy and alternate systems.\n\n\n          Use of intermediary translation and dictionary look-up service\n\nTo allow a service to provide search services from clients in other \nlanguages, the service should do the search more than once, depending on \nimplementation design.  First, in the original text as submitted by the \nclient, and a second or more search after submitting the original query \nto a translation or dictionary look-up service.\n\nAs and example, the address \"422 St. Jerome St.\" could be also be \nrepresented as:\n\n    en:      422 Saint Jerome Street\n    fr:        Rue De 422 Saints Jerome\n    es:      Calle De 422 Santos Jerome\n    de:      422 Heiliger Jerome Stra??e\n    ja:        422 ???????????????Jerome ?????????\n\n\nThe query would look something like this:\n\nClient ==> <query xml:lang=\"lang0\"> ==> service ==> <query xml:lang=\"lang0\".\n                                    ^== look-up service\n                                    v\n                                    ==> <query xml:lang=\"lang1\">\n                                    ==> <query xml:lang=\"lang2\">\n                                    :\n                                    ==> <query xml:lang=\"langN\">\n\n\n          Phonetic searches\n\nNote that phonetic searches, such as \"Soundex\" are usually tuned to \nspecific language characteristics.  Soundex, for example, was designed \nfor the U.S. Census Bureau in 1890, and first patented in 1918 to allow \nphonetic sorting of English surnames.  It has poor precision, is unable \nto handle multicultural names, produces many false positives and misses \nmany potentially correct terms.  That being said, there exist \nproprietary phonological name matching software that produces better \nresults across languages and cultures, but it must be tested and \nimplemented with the caveat that phonetic searching across languages is \ninherently fraught with errors due to the dialectical differences.\n\n\n\n"

If this is a lame example (not best practices), I'm open to other\nsuggestions.  I mainly wanted to emphasize the use of headers in intermediary\nprocessing, since it wasn't covered elsewhere.\n\nWSDL input tomorrow...\n\nMary\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTEXT\n\n5.4 SOAP Headers\n\n5.4.1 Characteristics of SOAP headers\n\nThe SOAP header is an optional element which can be used to extend SOAP\nprocessing in an application-specific manner.  The header specification\nis intentionally minimal so that headers may be tailored to meet the\nneeds of various applications.  As such, they may be used to convey\nadditional contextual information about data in the body of the SOAP\nmessage, as illustrated elsewhere in this document.  They may also be\nused to initiate or control processing of the message data, either by\nthe ultimate receiver of the message or by intermediary nodes which\nhandle the message before it is routed to the ultimate receiver.  In\nthis second role, SOAP headers may contain information specifying the\nrouting of SOAP messages and the processing which may (or must) occur\nat intermediary nodes.\n\nAlthough applications are encouraged to use standard, locale-neutral,\ndata formats, processes, and methodologies, it is sometimes necessary or\ndesirable to use proprietary data formats or techniques.  SOAP headers\ncan provide the flexibility required to process heterogeneous,\nlocale-sensitive, distributed data.\n\n\n5.4.2 Character encoding conversion scenario\n\nAn environment exists in which related legacy applications exchange\ncharacter data with a service.  The receiving service and the senders\nare not necessarily using the same character encoding scheme.  An\nintermediary site receives the sender's message and, using data in the\nmessage's SOAP header, converts the message's character data to the\nencoding of the ultimate receiver, the service.\n\n\n5.4.3 Scenario description\n\nAn application sends a SOAP message with character data encoded in the\ncharacter set of its local process.  The ultimate receiver of the\nmessage is a service which processes UTF-8 data.  An intermediary\nreceiver examines message headers before forwarding the messages to the\nultimate receiver.  If the character encoding is not UTF-8, the\nintermediary converts the data, modifies the character encoding\nattribute of the message, removes the header, and forwards the message\nto the ultimate receiver.\n\n\n5.4.4 Scenario example\n\nSOAP message received by intermediary:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\" ?>\n<env:Envelope xmlns:env=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\">\n  <env:Header>\n    <WS-I18N:convertData\n       xmlns:WS-I18N=\"http://example.org/2002/11/21/WS-I18N\"\n       env:role=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/next\">\n       <WS-I18N:senderEncoding>ISO-8859-1</WS-I18N:senderEncoding>\n    </WS-I18N:convertData>\n  </env:Header>\n  <env:Body>\n     . . .[legacy ISO-8859-1 data]\n  </env:Body>\n</env:Envelope>\n\n\nSOAP message forwarded from intermediary:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<env:Envelope xmlns:env=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\">\n  <env:Body>\n     . . .[UTF-8 data]\n  </env:Body>\n</env:Envelope>\n------------------------------------------------\nMary K.

Some of these preferences might include:\n\n    * Natural language text processing (parsing, spell checking, grammar\nchecking are examples of these)\n    * User interface language, imagery, colors, sounds, etc.\n    * Presentation (human-oriented formatting) of dates, times, numbers, lists,\nand other values.\n    * Collation (sorting), often specified with xml:sort\n    * Alternate Calendars, including holidays, work rules, weekends, the\norganization of months, the numbering of years and so forth.\n    * Tax or regulatory regime\n    * Currency\n    * ...and many more\n\nBecause there are a large number of preferences, software and Web\nservices often use an identifier based on language and location as a\nshorthand indicator for collections of preferences that typify categories of\nusers. HTML for example uses the lang attribute for this purpose. XML\nuses the xml:lang attribute. Java, POSIX and other software development\nmethodologies use a similar-looking (but not identical) construct known as\nlocale. In this document, we will use the term locale as the name for this\nshorthand indicator for a user's particular set of international preferences.\n\n[definition: Locale] Shorthand identifier representing the particular\nspecification of international preferences that a (certain category of) user\nrequires.\n\nGenerally, systems that are internationalized can support a wide variety of\nlanguages and behaviors to meet the international preferences of many\nkinds of users. When a particular set of preferences is operationally\navailable (often called \"enabled\"), then the system is referred to as\nlocalized. \n\n[Definition: Localization] Localization  is the tailoring of a system to the\nindividual cultural\nexpectations for a specific target market or group of individuals. The target\ngroup is often indicated by the Locale identifier.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that many of the international preferences\ndo not correlate strongly with Locale identifiers based solely on language and\nlocation.\nFor example, the locale of \"en-US\" (English, United States) encompasses\nseveral time zones, so the user's prefered time zone cannot be deduced\nby the locale identifier alone.  Many cultures have more than one way of\ncollating text, and so the appropriate sort ordering cannot always be \ninfered from the locale. For example, Japanese applications may use different\norderings known as radical-stroke and stroke-radical.\nGermany and other parts of the world may use different sort orderings known as\ndictionary vs phonebook.\n\nDistinguishing these situations requires forethought in the design of the\nservice\nand the setting of reasonable default values.\n\nEach user or system in a Web services interaction may have its own\ndefault locale settings. The interplay between the requester, provider,\nservice host, intermediaries, and so forth may have complex implications.\n\n\n\n"

As an example, a floating-point number is \nrepresented in some\n   binary format internal to an application, and is converted to a text ual \nformat, with\n   appropriate localization formatting (e.g. using a decimal comma rather \nthan a decimal\n   point for many European locales), for output to the user.</p>\n   <p>Because XML is an\n   inherently textual format, the XML Schema Datatypes also are textual. \nNevertheless,\n   most of them were carefully designed to be locale-independent, and are \nintended to\n   be used locale-independent.

[Owner: Addison]\n\nIn these scenarios, providers may offer services with support for either\ndiffering or a variety of international preferences.\nAn intermediary service makes requests of these providers and uses the results\nto satisfy the requests coming from its clients.\nThe intermediary service may process and/or integrate the results from\ndifferent providers to create a new kind of service.\nThe intermediary service may cache its results, or the results returned to it\nby its providers, for reuse with subsequent requests.\n\nClients requesting intermediary services can have different international\npreferences.\nTherefore the intermediary service must be careful with its algorithms for\ndetermining when to reuse requests.\nProper tracking of source data locale and requester locale is required.\nAlso, correlation and/or aggregation of data may prove difficult if sound\ninternationalization principles are not used.\n\n5.2.3 I-012: Caching\n\nIf caching does not take international preferences into account, it is possible\nthat\ncached responses in the wrong language, format, or locale could be returned.\n\n5.2.3 I-012: Locale Negotiation in Intermediary Services\nAlternatively, in scenario I-020, the intermediary service caches fault reasons\nand\nother data returned from its providers in each of the languages and cultural\nconventions that are requested of it, tracking the locales of each result.\n\nRequesters of the intermediary service identify the desired locale of expected\nresults.\nWith locale negotiation, the intermediary service can provide results and/or\nfault reasons that match the requester's international preferences..\n\n\n5.2.2 I-007: Locale Negotiation and Chained Services\n\nChained services are a form of intermediary services.\nA (source) provider defines a service that has a requirement for a language or\nlocale preference. Another (intermediary) service provider, defines the same\nservice\nand invokes the first service to utilize its capabilities.\n\nThe source provider defines an optional header containing a language\nrequest field. If the intermediary service does not also define the optional\nheader, then when it receives a request it cannot communicate the\nrequester's preferences to the source provider. The intermediary service\nmight indicate its own international preference(s) to the source provider or\nnone, accepting default values. Unless, the description of the\nintermediary's service declares its policy on addressing international\npreferences, its users may have incorrect expectations of the results.\n\n5.4 Soap headers\nIn a variation of these scenarios, a SOAP header can be used for locale\nnegotiation between each layer of requester, intermediary and service.\nAn example is a Web service wrapper to a legacy client/server application.\n\n\n#################################################################\n#################################################################\n#################################################################\n#####\n#####\n#####\n#################################################################\n#################################################################\n#################################################################\n\n\n\n"

The problem is exacerbated when the data can be multilingual in nature. For Web Services, in scenarios where the ordering of textual data is critical to its correct utilization, it can be extremely difficult to identify the appropriate collation rules to use with sufficient precision and to insure those rules are either followed by any services that operate on the data or that appropriate action is taken to compensate for any services that do not use the desired collation rules. (For example, re-sorting the data downstream).\n\nA brief list of these collation issues are described here. More details on internationalization of collation can be found in many of the books on internationalization. An important reference is UTR10\nhttp://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/\n\nSome types of internationally sensitive processing cannot be inferred solely from a language identifier or a locale. For example, the identifier does not indicate which sort ordering should be used. Types of sort orderings include: telephone, dictionary, phonetic, binary, stroke-radical or radical-stroke. In the latter two cases, the reference for stroke count may also need to be cited. A language identifier may be suggestive as to whether a requester expects a Traditional or a Modern sort ordering (in Spanish for example) but it may not be definitive.\n\nDifferent components or subsystems which are used by a software process may employ different sort orderings. For example, a User Agent may provide a drop-down list which sorts the elements of the list at run-time differently from the other components of the UA. Information retrieved from a database may be ordered by an index which has no correlation with the requester's requirements. When different components or subsystems or Web Services use different collation rules, then errors can occur. They are not always hard errors (i.e. generate faults) but the resulting data, operations, or events, may be incorrect.\n\nIn the case of services that might use a binary collation (ordering by the code points of text data) there can be differences in ordering introduced by different components using UTF-8 vs. UTF-16 internally.\n\nKnowing the language of the requester does not prescribe how sensitive the collation should be. Should text elements that are different by case or accent be treated as distinct? Should certain characters be ignored? For example, hyphens are often ignored so that \"e-mail\" and \"email\" sort together.\n\nWhere case is considered distinct, it may be important to describe whether all lowercase characters precede all uppercase characters, vice versa, or whether they should be intermixed.\n\nOther considerations include:\nSome languages treat two letters as a single unit for sorting. Spanish for example does so with \"CH\" and \"LL\". In addition, some collations map abbreviations to their expanded form. \"St. Botolph St.\" (in Boston) would expand to \"Saint Botolph Street\". (Well on a good day, given the ambiguity of \"St.\".)\n\nSimilarly, strings with digits may be collated by their textual representation (e.g. 1, 12, 2, A, AB, B) or they may be collated by their numeric value \n(e.g. 1, 2, 12, A, AB, B).\n\nIf the textual data is coming from different fields, that may also need to be accounted for. Consider for example, a lastname followed by a firstname field. If sorting is performed sequentially field by field,  then significant differences in the firstname field are swamped by minute differences in the lastname field. This can be improved by treating the fields as merged and then sorting.\n\nOf course, in a multilingual environment, many of the above decisions become more complex, and an approach that works for one language may interfere with others. For example, expansion of abbreviations. \n\nIn a  multilingual environment, the relative ordering of scripts must be decided.\n\nThe choice of rules for collation may also be application dependent. Looking up customers that access a service by voice may require a phonetic collation. Searching customer names entered by keyboard would use a different collation. Searching for text in a document may use less sensitive collations for ease of use and so the requester doesn't have to make repeated queries with alternative spellings.\n\nAn application sorting large numbers of records which are similar may use a more sensitive collation to order the records determinately.\n\nOften the performance of an application is impacted by collation. For example, if a service returns results in an unknown ordering, the requester may have to sort the results set to its collation. This can consume resources and delay the further use of the results until the entire set can be collated. Alternatively, if results are returned in the order needed by the requester, then the requester can begin to process the first records returned without waiting for the remaining records to arrive.\n\nOf course, collation can be performed at different stages of data processing and timing can be an important consideration. Database indexes are updated as the data is added to the database, not at the time a request arrives. Requests that can use the preordained collation of the index have a significant performance advantage over requests that either cannot use indexes or must resort results.\n\nSection 4.2.3 provides an example where collation makes a difference to web services.\n\n\n\n"

Are you okay with:\n\n------\n<div2><head>Ordering, Grouping, and Collation</head>\n\n<p>The ordering or collation of textual data items is a general concern for\ninternationalized software. The problem is exacerbated when the data can be\nmultilingual in nature. For Web services, in scenarios where the ordering of\ntextual data is critical to its correct utilization, it can be difficult to\nidentify the appropriate collation rules to use with sufficient precision to\ninsure those rules are either followed by any services that operate on the\ndata or that appropriate action is taken to compensate for any services that\ndo not use the desired collation rules. (For example, by re-sorting the data\ndownstream).\n</p>\n\n<p>A brief list of these collation issues are described here. An important\nreference is the  Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA), described by: <bibref\nref=\"UTR10\"/>. Although the UCA is a mature standard, it should be noted\nthat there is wide variance in the implementation of collation algorithms;\nthat few of these implementations are based on UCA; and that there is little\nor no general agreement on identifiers for collation preferences.</p>\n\n<p>Collation rules cannot be inferred solely from a language identifier or a\nlocale, as the identifiers do not indicate which sort ordering should be\nused within a locale. A language identifier may be suggestive as to whether\na requester expects a particular sort ordering (as with  Traditional or a\nModern ordering in Spanish, for example) but it may not be definitive.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples of sort orderings include: telephone, dictionary, phonetic,\nbinary, stroke-radical or radical-stroke. In the latter two cases, the\nreference (source standard) for stroke count may also need to be cited.\n</p>\n\n<p>Different components or subsystems which are used by a software process\nmay employ different sort orderings. For example, a User Agent may provide a\ndrop-down list which sorts the elements of the list at run-time differently\nfrom the other components of the agent. Information retrieved from a\ndatabase may be ordered by an index which has no correlation with the\nrequester's requirements. When different components or subsystems of a Web\nService use different collation rules, then errors can occur. They are not\nalways hard errors (i.e. those that generate faults) but the resulting data,\noperations, or events, may be incorrect or be perceived to be incorrect by a\nhuman observer.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of services that might use a binary collation (ordering by\nthe code points of text data) there can be differences in ordering\nintroduced by different components using UTF-8 vs. UTF-16 internally.\n</p>\n\n<p>Knowing the language of the requester does not prescribe how sensitive\nthe collation should be. Should text elements that are different by case or\naccent be treated as distinct? Should certain characters be ignored? For\nexample, hyphens are often ignored so that \"e-mail\" and \"email\" sort\ntogether.\n</p>\n\n<p>Where case is considered distinct, it may be important to describe\nwhether all lowercase characters precede all uppercase characters, vice\nversa, or whether they should be intermixed.\n</p>\n\n<p>Often the performance of an application is impacted by collation. For\nexample, if a service returns results in an unknown ordering, the requester\nmay have to sort the results using its local collation rules. This can\nconsume resources and delay the further use of the results until the entire\nset can be collated. Alternatively, if results are returned in the order\nneeded by the requester, then the requester can begin to process the first\nrecords returned without waiting for the remaining records to arrive.\n</p>\n\n<p>Of course, collation can be performed at different stages of data\nprocessing and timing can be an important consideration. Database indexes\nare updated as the data is added to the database, not at the time a request\narrives. Requests that can use the preordained collation of the index have a\nsignificant performance advantage over requests that either cannot use\nindexes or must re-sort the results.\n</p>\n\n<p>See <xspecref href=\"#S-009\">I-009</xspecref> and  <xspecref\nhref=\"#I-013\">I-013</xspecref>for a some examples.</p>\n</div2>\n\n------\n\nAddison P.

For example, the identifier does not\nindicate which sort ordering should be used. Types of sort orderings include:\ntelephone, dictionary, phonetic, binary, stroke-radical or radical-stroke.

(Well on a good day, given the ambiguity of \"St.\".)\n>\n> Similarly, strings with digits may be collated by their textual representation\n(e.g. 1, 12, 2, A, AB, B) or they may be collated by their numeric value\n> (e.g. 1, 2, 12, A, AB, B).\n>\n> If the textual data is coming from different fields, that may also need to be\naccounted for. Consider for example, a lastname followed by a firstname field.\nIf sorting is performed sequentially field by field,  then significant\ndifferences in the firstname field are swamped by minute differences in the\nlastname field.

I had in mind that someone might guess if the locale was\nSpain vs. Latin America, whether to use Modern or Trad., so it was indicative\nof collation in the same \"loose\" way PRC vs ROC is indicative of Simplified vs\nTrad. Chinese. It is not only that it is not specified but it can't (or\nshouldn't) be inferred.\n\nBut your suggestion is fine and we can address the issue of bad practices due\nto language identifiers being inadequate some other time and place.\n\n2)  ok on \"unfortunately\". As it is sometimes a good thing, I might qualify it\nas \"unintentional or unexpected\" differences, but it's ok for now.\n\n3) ok on \"strength\". I had considered \"strength\" and thought it might be too\nspecific to UCA and/or ICU and not generally recognized, whereas case and\naccent sensitivity are concepts most people have seen. But I did a search on\n\"collation strength\" and the term is used by Java and XML, thanks to their\nadoption of Unicode and so it has become more generally known. Addison, maybe\nwe can add a definition of strength in a footnote. I like Mark's parenthetical\nuse of \"(inverse of sensitivity)\". I think we should also add the reference to\ntn9- http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn9/.\n\nMark, You make an interesting distinction that strength makes a feature more or\nless important not necessarily ignorable.\nThere probably should be a separate name for that dimension of collation\n(ignoring characters, or indeterminacy) to distinguish it from strength.\nMost of the sorts I have worked with don't implement strength fully and leave\nthe sort indeterminate.\n\nok on replacing \"text elements\" too.\n\n4) on merging fields, we already reference UCA, but its ok to highlight the\ncoverage of this point in the UCA.\n\n5) on abbreviations, I am not sure how often expansion is used, I do know it is\ndone. If by limited environment you mean with respect to certain fields rather\nthan applied to all fields, yes of course.\n\non abbreviations in a multilingual context: well yes, collation is language\nsensitive and I was looking to indicate there are problems due to using narrow\nlanguage-sensitive operations in a multilingual space. Maybe you can suggest\nsome better examples?\nI think this is an area where Web Services may get tripped up.\n\n6) ok on searching and loose matching.\n\n7) on using more sensitive collation for large number of records, I did not\nmean to dynamically adjust the collation.\n\nBut in weighing the performance cost etc., decisions about strength or ignoring\ncharacters and leaving the sort indeterminate, are factors in selecting the\ncollation algorithm to begin with. I would use a different routine to sort a\ndrop-down list which is always small and where some indeterminacy is tolerable,\ncompared to sorting database records and where indeterminacy might force users\nto scan several screenfuls of data to look for a value and greater determinacy\nwould narrow that scan.\n\n8) ok on \"preordained\". And me an atheist... ;-)\n\n===========\nAddison, I am easy about who makes the changes for Mark's suggestions. I can't\nwork on this until at least tomorrow night though.\nIf someone can get to it sooner its fine with me.\nI am happy to work on it further, I am just crunched right now and can't do it\nimmediately.

The Usage Scenarios document\n(which will have a new version published tomorrow or the next day) goes to\nsome length to illustrate this problem. Applications can be designed to use\nexisting SOAP and WSDL capabilities to be internationalized.\nInteroperability requires standardization of the headers and body elements\nexchanged, but this is still firmly addressable at the application level\nwith a \"WS-I18N\" type infrastructure.\n\nWeb service providers (service hosts), OTOH, may need something more\nconcrete. I think this can be handled using existing extension mechanisms,\nbut I also think this is a choice that WS technologies need to make\neyes-open.

But\nthese \"standards\" are not universal and in some cases controversial. There\nis work under way in the I18N community to address these issues. Notably\nthere is a revision to RFC 3066 (draft-phillips-langtags-02.txt) that\nprovides more structure to language tags in general and an effort at the\nUnicode Consortium (Common Locale Data Repository, or CLDR, see\nhttp://www.unicode.org/cldr and http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35) to use\nthe revised language tags to identify particular locales.\n\nIf you look at other Web technologies, such as XSLT or CSS, which you might\nthink are \"locale-affected\" and which use xml:lang to identify \"the locale\",\nyou'll find that each one really does mean language and not locale.\nxsi:language is not locale and neither is HTTP Accept-Language. Web services\nis the first W3C set of technologies in which actual software locales cannot\nbe avoided by careful wording and nudge-nudge/wink-wink inference of the\nlocale from the language preferences at hand.\n\nIn other words, this is a requirement that W3C (and thus the I18N WG) should\npay attention to the problem of locales and international preferences on the\nWeb. In the past, individual technologies like .NET, J2EE, etc. have used\nthe existing de facto standard of reading HTTP Accept-Language to create\ntheir own individual solutions. But this flies in the face of Web service's\ndeclared intention of being platform and environment neutral. For \"WS-I18N\"\nto work, this problem must be addressed.\n\n\n>\n>\n> --\n> David Booth\n> W3C Fellow / Hewlett-Packard\n> Telephone: +1.617.253.1273\n\n\n\n"

I don't see the harm to users in simply ignoring\nsome characters, if you never intend to distinguish them in queries, and your\nusers do not depend on their being ordered.

Remember, all of the 17\ndifferent abbreviations for ICU I pointed to are valid in en-US. You can't\ndistinguish them by locale at all. If you wanted to have a system whereby for\neach locale and datatype there was a mapping from acronyms to expanded text,\nthat I would say was possible. I'd also say it was unnecessary, and the\nlikelihood of anyone spending all the money to do that is pretty close to nil.\n\nMark\n__________________________________\nhttp://www.macchiato.com\n??? ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: \"Tex Texin\" <tex@xencraft.com>\nTo: \"Mark Davis\" <mark.davis@jtcsv.com>\nCc: \"Addison Phillips [wM]\" <aphillips@webmethods.com>; \"Web Services\"\n<public-i18n-ws@w3.org>\nSent: Tue, 2004 May 11 17:55\nSubject: Re: sec 4.11\n\n\n>\n>\n> Mark Davis wrote:\n> > > 1) ok on \"suggestive\".

Dan Connolly and Michael Mealling noted that the W3C\nURI group was in a slow transition between being\na W3C Interest Group and a W3C Coordination Group,\nbut that no, it hadn't discussed this update.\n\nMealling and Ned Freed noted that the proposed\nchanges were mostly minor (IPV6 syntax, etc.)\nexcept for the integration of Internationalized URIs.\n\nConnolly reported that he's undecided, after considerable\ndeliberation, on whether the URI RFC should be updated to\ninclude \"IRI\"s at this point.\n\nFreed suggested that an IETF working group is perhaps in order;\nthe process of assembling a charter is the traditional way\nto scope potentially costly discussions.\n\nACTION Freed: to contact Larry Masinter\nabout drafting a charter for a revision to RFC2396.\n\nno constraint on whether I18N stuff is in scope or not.\n\n[postscript: this has been done.

Publication Requirements\nMultipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Four:\n                        Registration Procedures\nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048\n\nIan Jacobs summarized interaction between recent W3C TAG\nfindings\n  TAG Finding: Internet Media Type registration,\nconsistency of use\n  http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2002/0129-mime\nand end-game work in the W3C XML Protocol working group.\n\nTim Berners-Lee elaborated:  W3C specs have specified a language...\nlanguage specifications are connected to Web Architecture\nvia the MIME type registry... sometimes the material submitted\nto the MIME registry has said more than the W3C REC-track\nspec says... The questions in the MIME registry are good ones;\nthe answers belong in the spec... so the W3C TAG decided the\nanswers to the MIME registry questions should be in the W3C spec...\n\nFreed described an earlier proposal that should perhaps be revisited:\na std. facet (ala the prs. and vnd. facets); registration of\nmedia types (e.g. application/std.w3c.foo) could be delegated\nto standards organizations such as W3C. He estimated the cost\nof updating RFC2048 to be fairly low, though very near-term\nprogress would compete with the upcoming IETF meeting in\nYokohama (14-19July); e.g. the Internet Draft publication process\nis on hold until after that meeting.\n\nJoseph Reagle reacted positively to this proposal, as a long-term\nsolution, but noted that several W3C specifications are in\nthe process of registering media types currently.\n\nBerners-Lee suggested using the existing DNS and HTTP mechanisms\nas a long-term strategy for delegation of parts of the registry.\nThe std. facet procedure involves IANA for no good reason.\n\nFreed and Michael Mealling noted that this sort of thing\nhas been proposed before, with vocal opposition. The opposition\nfinds management of the registry very valuable, is satisfied\nwith the way IANA manages it, and is unwilling to risk\ndelegating it to other parties.\n\nBerners-Lee said it's OK for IANA to manage publication of\nthe IETF process, but to suggest that peer organizations\ncannot do likewise is counter to Web Architecture.\n\n[... the scribe didn't follow the technical discussion\nthat followed... something about using URIs\nin HTTP Content-Type header fields ...]\n\nJoseph Reagle recalled, from our 11 March meeting,\nsupport for the idea of having URIs for media types,\nand asked about any relevant progress.\n\nDaigle reported that the documents specifying URNs\nfor media types had recently been approved by the IESG;\nthey're awaiting publication by the RFC editor.\nthis means that URNs can go live after IAB/IESG coordination.\n\nJoseph Reagle asked about the status of a specific pending request:\n\n  From: Joseph Reagle <reagle@w3.org>\n  To: internet-drafts@ietf.org, ietf-types@iana.org\n  Date: Wed, 5 Jun 2002 17:21:55 -0400\n  Cc: ietf-xml-mime@imc.org, xml-encryption@w3.org\n  Message-Id: <20020605212156.7576487E@policy.w3.org>\n  Subject: Request to publish ietf-draft of\nXML Encryption media-type registration\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-encryption/2002Jun/0011.html19:33:44 \nFreed clarified: that's fine for getting an internet\ndraft published, but ietf-types@iana.org is just\na review forum, not a place to send \"please register this\"\nrequests.\n\n[... extensive discussion of IANA queues, IESG queues,\nand RFC editor queues, and interactions between them ...]\n\n\nMealling and others recommended:\n\n  1) Put the answers to the media type registration questions\nin the W3C REC-track spec (perhaps in an appendix).\n\n  2) Write short internet draft (a \"pointer document\") saying\n   \"We want to register the mime type defined in this w3c\n   spec appendix....\". Make sure the \"IANA Considerations\"\nsection clearly says\n\"The IANA is directed to register the mime type 'foo'\nusing the template found in the document bar\nupon publication of this document as an RFC.\"\n\n    The answers to the ~7 MIME registry questions *don't* have to be\nin the pointer document.\n\n  3) take the W3C REC-track document thru the REC track,\nupdating the pointer document at least once\nevery 6 months.\n\n  4) Once the W3C REC-track document is done (i.e. is\na W3C Recommendation), send a request to rfc-editor,\nasking that the pointer document be published\nas an informational RFC.\n\nThe RFC editor will put it on the IESG queue.\nAfter IESG disposition, it'll be published\nas an RFC and, (as a result of the clear\n\"IANA considerations\" section from step 2)\nit'll go into the IANA registry.\n\nFreed advised copying him at step 4, as he is often\nin a position to expedite such requests.\n\nBerners-Lee noted that updating the registry so late\nin the process (a) provides no guarantee against\ncollisions, and (b) provides no lookup facility\nvia the IANA registry during development in \nthe W3C REC track.\n\nMealling observed that the risk of collisions\n(a) is mitigated by periodic publication of\nInternet drafts, and (b) has yet to materialize\nin any case.\n\nFreed offered to follow up on the idea of\na provisional registry, where entries\nwould expire with the corresponding\nInternet Draft.\n\nMealling described a web database for pending URN namespace\nregistrations which satisfied a lot of concerns among\nthose involved in registering URNs.\n\nACTION Mealling: send details of URN registration workflow tool.\n[in IRC, Mealling cited\n  http://uri.net/urn-nid-status.html\nadding\n\"that is currently down but it should work in an hour\nro two....\"]\n\n\nACTION Freed: persue update to RFC2048.\n  (with ideas such as std. facet, provisional registry)\n  draft out for review (not Internet Draft) in\n  yokohama timeframe.\n\nACTION Reagle: send his understanding of how to get a W3C language\nregistered as a media type.

That choice is being thrust on\nus by the industry and by the W3C. If we don't provide this then\nthe current 'http:' URIs that the IANA has now _will_ become\nunchangeable entity references in emerging standards.\n\n> Having multiple names for the same protocol parameter is generally\n> a bad idea.

There is no _primary_ name for the protocol paramenters. There\nare standards that reference the IANA as the place to look, but there\nis no way of talking about those parameters using an identifier.\n\n> Furthermore, the use of URIs in place of registered protocol parameters\n> provides an easy way to bypass the procedures that have been established\n> for registering such numbers or tokens for that particular protocol -\n> at least in protocols whose parameters are ASCII strings that are more-or-less\n> syntax compatible with URIs.  This is not something we should encourage.\n\nA URI is going to be used regardless of what you or I would like them\nto use instead of one.

I was originally pursuing the strategy [2] akin \nto 3240 but some think the spec itself should contain the registry \ninformation, so I will move the non-boilerplate content of [2] into the W3C \ndocument, and the next version of the internet-draft will be nothing more \nthan a one line statement saying \"see appendix foo in W3C spec.\" Even so, \nyou get into hairy situations with which spec becomes stable first, and \nwhich way the references flow under this scenario (which I try to address \nwith [1]) though an improved process is desired by some.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/2002/06/registering-mediatype.html\n[2] http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-reagle-xenc-mediatype-00.txt\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "The W3C XML Protocol Working Group is currently working on the Message \nTransmission Optimisation Mechanism (MTOM)[1], which allows more \nefficient transmission of SOAP envelopes [2] by changing their \non-the-wire XML serialisation.\n\nRegistration of the \"application/soap+xml\" media type is currently \nunder way, so that SOAP envelopes can be identified in MIME and \nMIME-like systems. We anticipate the need to likewise identify MTOM \nmessages in these systems, and would like to solicit guidance about the \nbest way to do so.\n\nWhereas the XML 1.0 serialisation of SOAP is self-contained, MTOM \nserialisation will only use XML for a subset of the envelope data. \nOther portions of the envelope will be transmitted in separate binary \nentities, typically but not necessarily in a multipart/related MIME \nmessage, and those entities will be referenced with URIs from the \nenvelope (which, when using multipart/related, would reside in the root \npart).\n\nThe XML that is transmitted by MTOM is thus distinct from \napplication/soap+xml in at least the following respects:\n\n* It contains some but not all of the envelope data. Indeed, in the \ncommon case where multipart MIME is used, it's the entire package that \nconveys the same information as application/soap+xml.\n\n* Its semantics are different from those of a SOAP envelope. The usual \nsemantic for a SOAP envelope is to apply the SOAP processing model; the \nsemantics of an MTOM envelope are to to resolve the link URIs to create \na new Infoset, which is in turn processable by the SOAP model.\n\nTherefore, it appears that the application/soap+xml media type, as \ncurrently defined, is not appropriate to describe the XML format \ncreated by MTOM.\n\nWe've considered several possible alternatives, including 1) use of a \nHTTP content-coding (which we rejected, both because content-codings \nare a HTTP-specific mechanism, whereas we intend to use this encoding \nin other protocols, possibly including MIME-based protocols, and \nbecause doing so would require labelling the HTTP entity with an \n\"application/soap+xml\" media type, which would mask the presence of \nmultipart MIME), and 2) a MIME content-transfer-encoding (which we \nrejected because registration of new CTEs is discouraged by RFC2045).\n\nTherefore, we believe that it would be most suitable to register a new \nmedia type, e.g., \"application/soap_mtom+xml\". This media type would \nidentify the XML pre-MTOM processing (i.e., with the URIs to be \nreferenced still embedded), possibly (but not necessarily) located \ninside a multipart/related package.\n\nNote that a specification is being prepared that allows for the use of \na similar \"resolve the URI to insert binary characters\" idiom in \nnon-SOAP scenarios.  The general technique is documented at [3] under \nthe working title \"MTOM Inclusion Format For You (MIFFY)\", a title that \nwill almost surely change due to copyright issues.  The proposed \napplication/soap_mtom+xml media type is thus a specific example of the \nso-called Miffy class of encodings.  We propose that a media type be \nassigned to each such use of Miffy, with application/soap_mtom+xml \nbeing assigned as the name for the application of Miffy to SOAP \nenvelopes.\n\nWe would appreciate any input as to whether this is the most \nappropriate way to flag the use of an alternate serialisation of an XML \nformat in MIME, and/or pointers to guidance on this matter.\n\n1. http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-mtom/\n2. http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part0/\n3. http://www.w3.org/mid/DD037726-2236-11D8-836E-00039396E15A@bea.com\n\n--\nMark Nottingham   Principal Technologist\nOffice of the CTO   BEA Systems\n\n\n\n"

I suggest that similar examples\nbe added to the respective specs. There is a huge difference\nbetween a spec that only talks about information items, and\na spec that also contains an example to help the reader get\na start.\n\nAlso, I think it is very important to distinguish binary data\nfrom actual character data. One concern I have is that users\nof base64 in general or of this specific mechanism might misuse\nit to encode character data in a binary form, which would loose\nencoding identification which is done very well for XML.\nCan you please try to change the wording with this in mind?\nPlease tell me if you want this checked.\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n>A simplistic example might be;\n>\n>---8<---\n>MIME-Version: 1.0\n>Content-Type: Multipart/Related; boundary=MIME_boundary; \n>type=application/soap_mtom+xml;\n>         start=\"<envelope01@example.org>\"\n>\n>--MIME_boundary\n>Content-Type: application/soap_mtom+xml\n>Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n>Content-ID: <envelope01@example.org>\n>\n><?xml version='1.0' ?>\n><SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"...\">\n><SOAP-ENV:Body>\n>   <!--- xml content here -->\n>   <Image type=\"image/jpeg\"><Include xmlns=\"...\"\n>     href=\"cid:binary01@example.org\"/></Image>\n>   <!--- xml content here -->\n></SOAP-ENV:Body>\n></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>\n>\n>--MIME_boundary\n>Content-Type: image/jpeg\n>Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary\n>Content-ID: <binary01@example.org>\n>\n>[binary image]\n>--MIME_boundary--\n>---8<---\n>\n>Which could be transformed to this XML -\n>\n>---8<---\n><?xml version='1.0' ?>\n><SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV=\"...\">\n><SOAP-ENV:Body>\n>   <!--- xml content here -->\n>   <Image type=\"image/jpeg\">[base64-encoded image]</Image>\n>   <!--- xml content here -->\n></SOAP-ENV:Body>\n></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>\n>---8<---\n>\n>Is that helpful?\n>\n>Cheers & thanks,\n>\n>--\n>Mark Nottingham   Principal Technologist\n>Office of the CTO   BEA Systems\n\n\n\n"

I subsequently worked my way through the various\n     comments and released a new (-01) version that hopefully addresses\n     all the issues.\n\n     IETF policy is that ADs don't handle their own documents.

Reagle said he only needed for it to be effective\n   policy; \"BCP\" versus standards-track was not critical for his use.\n\n   Connolly asked Hardie to estimate when it would go to last call.\n   Hardie agreed to provide an estimate by email, noting that it would\n   most likely be after the July IETF meeting in Vienna. ACTION Hardie:\n   estimate last call on draft-freed-mime-p4-*.\n\n   Hardie noted that since it's an individual submission, last call would\n   be 4 weeks, rather than 2 weeks as for working group documents.\n\n     Ned Freed: refresh the status of the SMIL solicitation on the IESG\n     agenda.\n\n\n    from [17]13 March\n\n     [17] http://www.w3.org/2003/03/13-ietf-w3c.html#mediatypes\n\n   Hardie observed some progress on the [18]status of the [19]smil draft;\n   records seem to indicate that another draft was due from the author\n   (Hoschka) though noone present knew what needed to be fixed. ACTION\n   Hardie: enquire with IESG members such as Harald about what's expected\n   in a new smil draft, and whether the author has been notified.\n\n     [18] https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi?command=search_list&search_job_owner=0&search_group_acronym=&search_status_id=&search_cur_state=&sub_state_id=6&search_filename=smil&search_rfcnumber=&search_area_acronym=&search_button=SEARCH\n     [19] http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoschka-smil-media-type-11.txt\n\n   Connolly noted, with appreciation, that the IETF datatracker now uses\n   GET for its searches, so the results can, for example, be linked from\n   this record.\n\nNames of W3C ietf-drafts\n\n     Alison Mankin: bring up this issue to the IESG for confirmation and\n     report back to w3c-policy@apps.ietf.org, with possibility of asking\n     Joseph Reagle to reflect this resolution in W3C Guidebook.\n\n\n    from [20]13 March\n\n     [20] http://www.w3.org/2003/03/13-ietf-w3c.html#names\n\n   Daigle reported that discussion in the IESG raised some issues,\n   including how the IETF would recongnie what was a W3C draft.\n\n   Connolly suggested that the idea was more trouble than it was worth.\n   The matter was dropped.\n\ninternationalization in protocol elements\n\n     ACTION Martin D?rst: review the draft-iap-char-rep, and then\n     coordinate with Ted Hardie and Leslie Daigle on next steps.\n\n\n    from [21]13 March\n\n     [21] http://www.w3.org/2003/03/13-ietf-w3c.html#iab-i18n\n\n   Daigle reported on discussion beween Hardie, D?rst and herself in\n   March. ACTION Daigle: update this forum on next steps\n\nURI maintenance team\n\n   Hardie reported on movement away from the \"one-size-fits-all\" style\n   for IETF WGs. For new URI schemes, trying to clear the process and\n   backlog for new URI schemes. A problem has been that even thought\n   there is a [22]URI review forum, the process as it stands is that it\n   comes in to the RDC editor as an individual submission, the editor\n   turns it over to an IESG stuckee, who then replies with the suggested\n   disposition. (publish, publish with note prepended, etc...). Often the\n   stuckee turns to the URI review group.\n\n     [22] https://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/uri-review/current/maillist.html\n\n   Problems have been: useful responses from URI review group have met\n   with mixed responses from the original authors. The idea of a\n   long-lived mainainance team might work better. The URI maintenance\n   team would have responsibility to reach closure; It would have the\n   same appeal systems as a WG.\n\n   Connolly asked what motivates/pays the uri review team? Hardie\n   responded that it fits into the process better as a WG - and this\n   might justify people's time better.\n\n   Connolly asked about candidates for chair. Hardie suggested perhaps\n   Daigle, but Daigle was reluctant.\n\n   Hardie noted the coordination challenges in this work; e.g. a \"dns\"\n   URI scheme; it has undergone 5 draft revisions during review in\n   uri-review and on the DNS extensions list (namedroppers).\n\n   Connolly noted that in addition to those challenges, uri scheme\n   designers are not very motivated to write Internet Draft\n   specifications of their schemes in the first place; the schemes don't\n   rely on the registry for operation, except in the case of a collision,\n   which seems rare in practice. Connolly noted another \"dns:\" scheme in\n   the implementation of the rebol programming language. Perhaps making\n   an example of this collision would motivate scheme designers to\n   register their schemes.\n\n   Hardie noted with regret lack of progress on the vnd- branch of the\n   URI tree. Ian King was the original author, but it got lost within the\n   IESG.\n\n   Hardie asked for confirmation that a URI scheme maintenance team\n   wouldn't \"tread on W3C's toes\". Connolly and Berners-Lee confirmed;\n   Berners-Lee explored the idea of an explicit liaison with the W3C TAG;\n   Connolly suggested that as long as the idea was discussed in the W3C\n   URI Coordination Group, the right connections would be established as\n   a matter of course. ACTION Mealling: raise the \"uri maintenance team\"\n   idea in the W3C URI CG.\n\n   Hardie noted in passing the discussions in the [23]problem-statement\n   forum, but suggested that shouldn't prevent this maintenance team from\n   going forward. Others on the call expressed curiosity, but there\n   wasn't time to explore the matter further.\n\n     [23] http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/problem-charter.html\n\nnext meeting (next IETF is November 9-14)\n\n   RESOLVED to meet next [24]Wednesday, October 8, 2003, at 1:00:00 PM\n   Boston time (1700Z) for up to 90 minutes. Daigle to prepare an agenda.\n   Connolly to arrange teleconference and IRC facilities.\n\n     [24] http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=8&month=10&year=2003&hour=13&min=0&sec=0&p1=43\n\n   In closing, Connolly re-iterated the process for review of records:\n   Connolly sends a draft; after 7 day review, it goes public [to\n   public-ietf-w3c@w3.org]\n\n\n    Dan Connolly, 17 Jun 2003\n    $Revision: 1.5 $ of $Date: 2003/07/03 22:24:59 $\n\n\n-- \nDan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/\n\n\n\n"

After reading the previous emails, I\nsee that others have already been thinking that way. These are all great\nquestions! I think we could probably use a few even more elementary\nquestions as well. Below are a few of what I was thinking. Any thoughts?\n\n\n1. Why are the benefits of adding international-friendly code?\n\n    - quick overview of benefits \n    - demographics of \"who\" is using the web\n    - quick mention of the markup languages,\n      and how they work together (Unicode, XML, XHTML, etc.)\n    - quick mention of internationalization and localization\n    - long-term business benefits\n\n\n2. What are the first steps in migrating an existing HTML-based site to an\ninternational-friendly multilingual enabled XHTML site?\n\n    - walk through a suggested process at a very basic level\n      (including analyzing their business requirements and\n      future business growth plans)\n    - what skills and/or knowledge are needed \n      (refer to supplemental resources)\n    - introduce some considerations to help decide \n      what's best for their site/product\n\n\n3. What are the next steps...?\n\n    - <this could be a \"Part 2\" to the above question>\n\n\n4. Which web authoring applications can be used to create multilingual\nXHTML?\n\n    - <This is often very useful, but do we \n      want to cover this topic?>\n\n\n5. What design & editorial considerations are there for multilingual sites?\n\n    - discuss and give examples of:\n       - current language indicator (& change selector)\n       - country indicator (& change selector)\n       - font software requirements\n       - font treatments across different cultures\n    - quick overview of cultural differences in:\n      - time/date formats\n      - punctuation\n      - etc...\n    - refer to supplemental internationalization resources \n      which discuss cultural concerns dealing with color,\n      religion, etc.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nPhil Arko\nSiemens\n\n\n\n"

(If anyone has  \ninformation about this, please contact me; we still need to resolve the  \nregistration of application/soap+xml).\n\nA note was placed in the IESG's Web datatracker[1], but this was a  \ncomment from another IESG member about the shortcomings of the Draft,  \nnot an actual decision regarding the status of the Draft, which was  \nonly updated after Ned discovered the omission and changed the  \ndocument's status. No e-mail notification of any of this (except as  \nbelow) has been received by the Draft's authors.\n\nI (and therefore the WG) only found out about this because of e-mail  \ndiscussion following from comments I made to regarding  \ndraft-freed-mime-p4-04; if I had not made those comments, I'm  \nreasonably certain we still wouldn't know the status of the I-D.\n\nI'd also note that the IESG appears to administer its responsibilities  \nin a more informal fashion than the W3C does (e.g., the Draft wasn't  \nadded to the datatracker until September 11, e-mailing the authors of a  \nDraft about its status isn't seen as necessary, and it's thought  \nadequate notification of a problem when an IESG member comments without  \nchanging a Draft's status). As a result, it may be necessary to be in  \nmore constant contact with the IESG to ascertain the status of a  \nparticular Draft.\n\nMy recommendation to future W3C WGs that need to register media types  \nwould be to co-ordinate with the W3C liaison to get a periodic update  \nof their Drafts' status from the IESG (anecdotal evidence shows that  \nindividual queries to members of the IESG are often not responded to).\n\n\n1.   \nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/public/pidtracker.cgi? \ncommand=view_id&dTag=8198&rfc_flag=0\n\n\n\nOn Sep 8, 2003, at 2:32 PM, Mark Nottingham wrote:\n\n> [ note that followups are set to public-ietf-w3c only]\n>\n> The XML Protocol Working Group, as part of its work, needs to register  \n> the \"application/soap+xml\" media type with IANA.

First, for there to be ANY value to the registration, there needs to be a registrar.  Otherwise, there is no likelihood of interoperation.\n\nSecond, since the registration would be in the vnd tree, it is up to the W3C to maintain, publish, and control the registry.  That is a problem (beyond the organizational problem of the W3C maintaining a registry) in that Joe Random programmer somehow needs to know to look someplace in the W3C for what registration to use or what a particular value means.\n\nThird, one could easily envision someone in the IETF publishing application/mumble+xml and someone in the W3C publishing application/vnd.w3c.mumble+xml, where they have totally different semantics.  Yes, that is theoretically OK, because they are, by definition, different registrations.  However, most people expect a mumble to be a mumble...\n\nFourth, and conversely to the third, one could envision someone in the W3C publishing application/vnd.w3c.foo+xml.  Later on, it becomes of value to everyone, so it would make sense registering application/foo+xml in the IETF tree.  However, we then end up with two registrations for the same thing.\n\nOn a separate topic, I would strongly suggest AGAINST putting everything under application/xml.  One of the whole points of the MIME type system is that a user agent can make intelligent choices about objects WITHOUT examining the object itself.  If we went the application/xml route, user agents would have to parse the XML to figure out the namespaces, for example.  That can be an undue burden on applications.\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Simon St.Laurent [mailto:simonstl@simonstl.com]\n> Sent: Sun, September 14, 2003 11:01 AM\n> To: public-ietf-w3c@w3.org\n> Subject: Re: suggestion re: media type registration\n> \n> \n> \n> murata@hokkaido.email.ne.jp (MURATA Makoto) writes:\n> >On Fri, 12 Sep 2003 13:56:45 -0700 \"Roy T.

            "content": "Meeting minutes for W3/IETF coordination meeting\nReported by:  Ted Hardie\n\n\nAttending:  Tim Berners-Lee (W3C),  Dan Connolly (W3C), Leslie Daigle (IAB),\n                     Martin Duerst (W3C), Ted Hardie(IESG)\nMeeting Chair: Martin Duerst\n\nThe meeting covered the following agenda:\n\n* Review of Action Items from previous meetings\n* Coordination of meeting dates\n* Discussion of media type registration processes\n* Update on the progress of a revision to RFC 3023 (XML subtypes)\n* Review of open issues related to individual MIME types\n* Pointers to new work in each organization.\n* Discussion of jabber as a potential tool for future meetings.\n* Setting the date and time of the next meeting: June 17th, 2004 5pm \n-6:30 U.S. EDT\n\nIn the Action Item review, Ted reported that he had put the\nchairs of the WebDav working group in touch with XML Query\nWorking group.  Dan then reported that initial attempts to\nset up a URI coordination group had met scheduling\ndifficulties.  The group confirmed that the item is still\nof interest, and it will be carried forward.\n\nMartin then summarized the existing situation with IETF/W3C\nmeeting conflicts.  The Seoul IETF and W3C Technical Plenary\nconflict, and the situation may arise again in the meetings planned\nfor Fall of 2004.  Leslie Daigle re-affirmed that the IETF is interested\nin avoiding these conflicts, and that it will, in general, change\nvenues rather than dates once the dates have been announced.\nMartin Duerst will confirm with the W3C Administration team\nknows of the address at which to send meeting notices\nto the IETF. \n\nTed Hardie noted that the passage of the updated MIME documents\nmeans a new process will be in place for type/sub-type registrations.\nMartin Duerst has defined a process by which the W3C will interact\nwith the IETF for these registrations, both to streamline that process\nand to help W3C participants  understand the steps involved.  The\nIESG has reviewed a document describing the interface portions\nof that document and has agreed to make it the basis of the coordination.\nTed Hardie has committed to the IESG to produce the procedure\ndocument for the IETF's use, based on Martin's document and the\nW3C's comments.\n\nMartin then described the updates to RFC 3023.\nMartin and Chris Lilly have discussed the charset\nparameter extensively; there are likely to be text changes to the\ndocument to deprecate text/xml and text/$foo+xml.  The charset parameter\ntext is likely to be changed more generally, after a review of existing\nimplementations.  The main new item will be a definition of the default\nfragment identifier syntax will be for the generation application/$foo+xml.\nThis is for integration of work related to xpointer.  Dan asked Martin\nto check with the XSLT working group on the deprecation of text/xml.\nMartin agreed, and suggested that they might eventually register\nappliction/xslt+xml, but that would be a separate process.\n\nThe SMIL work remains an open issue for MIME type. Martin has sent email to\nPhilip Hoschka, who has the token for SMIL work at the moment.\n\nThe group then discussed new work and ways of coordinating work.\nThe current IETF/W3C effort is peer-to-peer, and it was agreed\nthat this was a better model than using a meta-standards repository,\nas has been proposed by other organization.  Tim noted, however, that\nwork to create standard metadata or interchange formats might be\nuseful.  The group discussed at what point coordination was useful.\nThe existing \"new-work\" mailing list is broadcast, and it is intended\nto cover work that is being considered as well as work that has been\napproved.  That limits some organizations participation, but it allows\nfor the participants to share work, in situations where both agree that\nwork needs to be done, but the allocation of it between organizations\nis not clear.  A \"pub-sub\" model was discussed as a way of providing\ndifferent amount of information, based on interest and affiliation.\nAll agreed that notification when work was undertaken was preferable\nto notification of completed work and probably easier to achieve\nthan notification of work under discussion.\n\n\nMartin asked whether there is a need for coordination between TAG\nand IAB, given their architectural responsibilities.  Dan noted that\nthe architecture documents went out for a very long last call,\nand that a review by the IAB might be useful. Appropriate\naction items were assigned.\n\nTed noted the upcoming work on anti-Spam mechanisms,\nSMTPng and email internationalization.  Tim indicated that there\nis interest within the W3C on the problems, and they have considered\nmechanisms for their own use.   The group then discussed the\ngeneral question of how the email infrastructure could scale\nin the face of spam.\n\nDan has noted the \"Marid\" BoF to the W3C systems folk, since they are\nalready using SPF records.\n\nThe group then discussed early stage work on binary xml, based on a\nrecent workshop.  There are people who care a lot about this.  Leslie asked if\nthis work includes compression, and Dan indicateed that it might. \nMartin noted that\nanother issue was actually processing time rather than compression.\n\nDan mentioned the Data Access Working group, and agreed to provide\nfurther information on that.\n\nLeslie noted that there are lots of folks who might be interested\nin consuming such if it were developed, but it is not really in\nthe IETF's core competence to create a compressed XML format.\n\nThe group then briefly discussed the use of jabber conferencing,\nand it agreed to use it on the next coordination call.\n\nNext meeting:  June 17th, 2004 5pm -6:30 U.S. EDT.\nThe next meeting will use Jabber conferencing.\n\n\nAction Items:\n\nDan Connolly to set up a meeting to coordinate further work on URIs.\nDan Connolly to send a pointer to the W3C architecture documents to the list.\nDan Connolly  to provide further information on the Data Access Working Group.\nLeslie Daigle to find an IAB reviewer for the architecture documents \nprovided by Dan.\nMartin Duerst to update the XSLT working group on progress related to RFC 3023.\n\n\n\n"

And, just to be clear, I don't \nthink that IRIs should be debated to death, but the document needs to \nbe clear. ]]\n\nI think the document is fairly good, although I'm not much of a URI \nperson, so I could be way off. After studying it this morning, I see \nwhere I got confused. I also disagree with some technical choices you \nmake later in the spec.\n\nClarifications:\n\nSection 1.1 needs to be a bit longer, and possibly split into two \nparts. You need more emphasis here that you are describing something \nthat will go into protocol elements. In addition, you need an \nexplicit discussion here about the difference between characters and \nencoded characters. You have this in section 2, but it is so \nimportant to understanding the applicability, it needs to be in 1.1.\n\nSubsection (c) in 1.2 is a mess and is probably where I really lost \nit. The first sentence has too many subordinate clauses in it. But \nworse, you introduce UTF-8. That's where I got confused about \ncharacters vs. encoding. I still don't know why UTF-8 is brought up \nhere. I propose that you start over on this subsection.\n\nThe last paragraph of 1.2 is confusing in the middle where you talk \nabout UTF-8. 0xE9 is not the representation of a UTF-8 character. \nEven though the example is wrong, it got me stuck in UTF-8 mode, \nwhich helped get me stuck in thinking that you were talking sometimes \nabout the encoding.\n\nTechnical issues:\n\nYou use NFC in Section 3.1. This goes against the theme of the \nguidelines in section 6. NFKC will cause less surprise if an IRI \ncontains compatibility characters, so you should use NFKC instead, \nregardless of the history of NFC in the W3C.\n\nI do not understand the logic of having Variants (B) and (C) in step \n1 in section 3.1. One is normalized, the other one isn't. Doesn't \nthis sound like a recipe for disaster? Why did you differentiate \nbetween these two cases?\n\nDoes the bidi processing in section 4 match what is specified in \nNameprep? If not, are there cases where a stand-alone IDN name will \nbe displayed differently than the same name in an IRI? That would be \na complete show-stopper, if true.\n\nI think that section 5.1 (b) is a bad mistake. The four reasons you \ngive are not strong enough for what seems like something that can \ncause huge conversion problems. I can also see this causing security \nproblems.\n\n--Paul Hoffman, Director\n--Internet Mail Consortium\n\n\n\n"

While we are at it, two comments:\n- Google wouldn't need the additional parameters in the search URI\n   (&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). They could just do a check on byte patterns,\n   and recognize the extremely specific UTF-8 byte pattern, and then\n   assume UTF-8 as the default.

I wouldn't mind to discourage unnecessary hexification,\nbut there is no reason to outlaw it. This is very parallel to URIs,\nfor example, http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/200%33/0%33/%331/IRI\n(replacing every '3' by '%33') isn't a particularly good URI, but\nit's not outlawed.\n\nAbout 'when to hexify', the current draft is pretty clear:\n\"as late as possible, but not later\" (in some more words).\n\nAbout the mapping from IRIs to URIs: That's described in all\ndetail.

Squeezing special information into the\n8th bit is rarely done these days.\n\nIt is fundamentally a question of character repertoire (ASCII vs.\nUnicode). And it is important to observe that the cases where\nURIs are used as real *identifiers* (namespaces and RDF), thanks\nto W3Cs work over the past close to 10 years, there is really no\nproblem with using Unicode as a repertoire.

That's done in Section 3.2.\n\nWhat section 1.2 says is just that in order to be able to use an IRI\nin a specific case, the characters on the server that one would want\nto directly expose in the IRI actually have to be exposed via UTF-8\nin the corresponding URI. In other words, if I have a file named\n\"r<eacute>sum<eacute>.html\" on my server, I can only put\n\"r<eacute>sum<eacute>.html\" into the IRI if \"r<eacute>sum<eacute>.html\"\nis actually exposed as r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.html in the corresponding\nURI.\n\nSection 3.1 indeed says that if you have\nhttp://www.example.org/r%E9sum%E9.html, and you try to convert it to\nan IRI, you still end up with http://www.example.org/r%E9sum%E9.html.\nIf you have http://www.example.org/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.html, and try\nto convert it to an IRI, you will end up with\nhttp://www.example.org/r<eacute>sum<eacute>.html. Because of the\nregularity of UTF-8, there is a high chance that this corresponds\nto the actual characters on the back side, but this is not guaranteed,\nthe same way you have no guarantee that http://www.example.org/A\nactually corresponds to an \"A\" on the server side. The only guarantee\nyou have is that the \"A\" stands for octet %41, and that the server\nwill know what that octet corresponds to.\n\nDoes that explain things better?\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n\n"

This is only to provide a base level of\npredictability. Still indeed this could lead to security\nproblems with the mechanisms you describe above, if there\nare two users that have user names that only differ in\nnormalization.

Perhaps some properly worded text could\nbe derived from the following strawman?\n\n   Whenever fields of an IRI are normalized, the octet representation\n   is modified.

Unfortunately, I have not identified the correct list to \nask about this.  This list seemed the closest, although that may have \nbeen an erroneous determination.  I18N lists do not seem correct, \nbecause these questions are not fundamentally internationalization \nquestions -- the internationalization is already satisfied by IRIs and \nthe question is how to replace URIs with IRI's or the next great thing. \n URI lists did not seem correct, because IRIs and other possible \nfollow-ons are not URIs.  Perhaps the tag list?\n\n[...]\n\n> In that case, the DOM just has to make\n> sure that the values for the set/get allow characters outside\n> US-ASCII, and can leave the interpretation of these values\n> to the XML spec.) So some more discussion may be needed.\n\nDOM has never specified that these values were necessarily checked, but \nthe user of a specification has been told that these are URIs.  Just as \na user who supplies a native filename argument would not expect a URI to \nwork, even though it is possible to contemplate an implementation that \nallowed that, regularly supplying an IRI into an attribute or parameter \nwhich is called \"URI\" is quite problematic.  As we fix this, it seems \nshort-sighted to take an argument or attribute that was previously named \nor described as a URI and now call the argument an IRI.  If we have to, \nI guess we make up our own generic name and description that will not \nbreak so easily again.\n\n[...]\n\n> One of the principles of IRIs is that they should not be used\n> indiscriminately where URIs are used, but that a spec actually\n> should explicitly say that a given parameter/attribute/... is\n> an IRI. This does not match well with the idea of 'automatic update'.\n\nBut in practice, the idea of the automatic update (possibly with a few \nexplicit exceptions) seems more likely.  This is quite consistent with \nnot only with my own own inclination, but also with the feedback from \nthe I18N working group on the DOM Core and Load and Save Modules:\n\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2003JanMar/0061.html\n\n[...]\nC17) Substitute IRI for URI throughout.\n[...]\nLS5) Substitute IRI for URI throughout.\n\n> Also, URIs in general are defined to be very flexible, and\n> accommodate new functionality e.g. through new schemes. It is\n> generally considered better not to impose strict syntax checks\n> on interfaces that handle URIs to allow future evolution.\n\nAnd we generally do exactly that where practical.  But, again, IRI's are \nnot URI's.  The new URI schemes always followed the basic meta-rules, \nsuch as not permitting space and various other quite significant \ncharacters -- I am not worried about further evolution that is still a \nURI or IRI.  That is already covered.  I am worried about the next time \nnew types are introduced.\n\n> Also, I don't know of any other major issue than internationalization\n> that is outstanding.

So maybe asking on the\n> uri@w3.org list will give you a better idea. \n\nThe thing to discuss on the URI list might be extending the URI \nspecification so that IRI's can be properly called URI's.  If this is \nnot likely, it would not seem to me to be the proper forum.  The URI \nrules are still quite restrictive in a number of ways.  We suspect that \nthere will be more out-of-the-URI-syntax-box enhancements.\n\nIs discussion of IRI's considered a subset of the URI discussion, or \noutside of the URI discussion because IRI's are not URI's?  If it is \noutside, then it is not clear to me that that group discusses things \nthat fall outside of their domain.  We are not asking about how to refer \nto URI's, but rather how to avoid referring to any specific RI scheme \nsuch as URIs or IRIs because of the situation this leaves us in.\n\nThanks,\n\nRay Whitmer\n\n\n\n"

Do you think there should\n>be? If yes, where should it go? What should it say?\n\nThe %-escaping mechanism in RFC 2396 is an irreversible encoding, RFC\n2396 says, you can escape \"&\" as %26 but it does not say, that %26 can\nbe unescaped to \"&\". RFC 2396 also does not specify how characters\noutside the US-ASCII range have to be %-escaped, neither does the IRI\ndraft (except when IRIs are converted to URIs).\n\nIMO, the IRI draft should say, that if %-escaping is used in an IRI, the\nescape sequence must be generated from UTF-8 octets and %-escapes must\nbe interpreted as octets in an UTF-8 sequence.\n\nThis approach would be problematical if the IRI originates from an URI\nthat used %-escapes that could not be interpreted as UTF-8 sequence or\nif people like to encode abitrary binary data in the IRI. The latter is\nIMO not a valid use case for IRIs, if a specific scheme wants binary\ndata, it should first convert the bytes to characters (using e.g.\nBase64) and then apply %-escpaping to these characters if necessary. The\nformer could be resolved by either making such URIs unconvertable or by\nadding an additional escaping scheme for either non-UTF-8 octets or\nUTF-8 octets (like http://www.example.org/%U0000F6 for\nhttp://www.example.org/%f6), I prefer to make them unconvertable.\n\nIRIs are a sequence of characters, I think this definition should not\nchange to a sequence of characters, intermixed with abitrary octets\nafter unescaping %-escapes.\n\n\n\n"

IMAA may do that, but I don't think it does.\nFor IRIs, we have decided that the only context an application\nneeds is to know is that overall, this is an identifier. This\nsimplifies implementation quite a bit. In many cases, in particular\nfor all-rtl cases, this knowledge is not even necessary, and even\nif an IRI is not embedded in explicit LTR context, the single\nmissing bit still can be guessed easily.\n\nThis is based on feedback we have received both from Israelis\nand from Arabs. For example, whenever Arabs have presented\nArabic domain names, they always did it as MOC.BARA.BEW\n(inverting not only each component of web.arab.com, but\nalso the order of the labels) rather than BEW.BARA.MOC\n(just inverting the labels internally).\n\nThe solution makes it easier for people without any specific\nknowledge of IRI/mail address/domain name syntax to read\nthese things in the right order.\n\nSo the proposed display algorithm for IRIs doesn't need any\ninternal knowledge of the IRI (or email address, or domain\nname) structure. So there is no need to apply the bidi check\nto the whole left hand part if that's not deemed appropriate.\n\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n\n"

Now the problem of course is\nthat we can't have it both ways.\n\nNow take another example, www.BARA.com. This again in\nan LTR context looks better as www.BARA.com; in an RTL\ncontext, it will look better as com.BARA.www.\nTo some extent, the more LTR pieces you have, the better\nit looks in LTR context, and the more RTL pieces you have,\nthe better it will look in RTL context. But judgement is\ndifficult, and creating an algorithm that counts pieces,...\nwould be too complex.

It bothers me that it's\n'middle-endian', with the least-significant component in the middle.\n\nI was naively assuming that \n\nBEW.BARA.com and\ncom.BARA.BEW\n\nwere the only sensible ways of writing the domain.\n\nI hadn't grasped the idea that most users of RTL languages will be\nsufficiently used to LTR-in-RTL embeddings that they will find it\nnatural to read this construct in logical order.  (Even though this is\nactually an RTL-in-LTR embedding, the principle is familliar enough\nthat users are happy with it, presumably?)\n\n > To some extent, the more LTR pieces you have, the better\n > it looks in LTR context, and the more RTL pieces you have,\n > the better it will look in RTL context.

It's a matter of assumptions, and mine were biased by looking\nat the structure of the domain, rather than at the assumptions that a\nuser of an RTL lanuage would make.\n\n > There is no place here for \"user's preferred writing direction\".\n > If we put something on the side of a bus, or on a name card,\n > the user's preferred writing direction is lost.\n\nYou're right.  I misunderstood the original point about WEB.ARAB.COM\nrendering as MOC.BARA.BEW rather than BEW.BARA.MOC (and thought this\nwas an option depending on bidi embedding level or something).\n\n > I'm not sure it was discussed on the IDN list.

I haven't followed any of the IRI\ndiscussion (except where it was referenced on the IDN list) so I don't\nthink it's that I'm thinking of.\n\n > >I'm not sure the same issues really occur with local parts, though,\n > >since separators only have local significance.

What we have to care about is the end users.\n\nPossibly, but there is no spec for the structure of a local part.  So\nsaying 'just render it according to the bidi algorithm' (as you have\ndecided is also correct for IRIs -- which *are* structured) seems\nnatural.\n\nWhat restrictions -- if any -- should be made on the content of a\nlocal part is a somewhat separate issue (though it's what caused me to\nstart this thread).\n\n-roy\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Martin,\n\nLet me try and express my concerns in a rather more focussed and\ncondensed way.\n\nLet us just consider a written URI such as:\n\nhttp://www.example.org/D%C3%BCrst\n\nThis is a perfectly valid RFC2396 URI, and is also identifiable as\nusing one of the schemes defined in RFC 2616.\nNeither of these RFCs tell me what decoding to apply to the two\nescaped octets, as we have agreed.\n\nNow suppose your IRI document has become an RFC, but nothing else has\nchanged.\n\nI still don't know what processing, if any, to apply to the above\nURI - it could have been written long before your document came into\nforce.\n\nSo let's suppose we define a new HTTP version, say HTTP/1.2, to cope\nwith this.\n\nHTTP/1.2 cannot simply issue a decree that henceforth the above URI is\nto be assumed to have been generated from an IRI, and that the reverse\nprocessing of your section 3.2 should be applied. That would be\ninappropriate processing to apply to pre-existing URIs.\n\nSo, I conclude that there *must* be some visible indication that the\nsequence originated in an IRI, and therefore that the reverse\nprocessing of 3.2 must be applied.\n\nHere's my solution:\n\nIntroduce a pair of additional HTTP schemes 'httpi' (defaulting to\nport 80) 'and httpis' (defaulting to port 443) in an update to HTTP -\nsay HTTP/1.2.\n\nNow we write\n\nhttpi://www.example.org/D%C3%BCrst\n\nand the new HTTP/1.2 tells us that the reverse processing of your 3.2\n*must* be applied to this URI scheme.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nOf course, there could be be different syntactic arrangements serving\nthe same purpose, but, essentially, my belief is that, at least in in\nthe context of HTTP, there *must  be* some kind syntactic indication\nthat IRIs are involved.\n\nThere are some interesting details to define when considering what\ngoes 'down the wire' in HTTP messages, but that can be considered\nlater - the essential need can be made simply by considering the\nprinted URI.\n\nMy original eMail was really asking what the HTTP community's own\nthinking is on this issue.\n\nMaybe there are no such thoughts and this proposal will 'kick-start'\nsome action on the rapid take-up of IRIs in HTTP - which is what I\nwant to promote.\n\n\nI'll be starting my 6-day vacation 8 hours from now, so any dialog\nwill be interrupted - sorry!\n\nChris\n\n\n\n\"Martin Duerst\" replied:\n\n>\n> Hello Chris,\n>\n> Many thanks for your comments on the IRI spec.\n>\n> I have noted your issue as:\n> http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#queryclarify-16\n>\n> More explanations below.\n>\n> At 23:21 03/06/26 +0100, Chris Haynes wrote:\n>\n> >Dear Martin / Michel,\n> >\n> >I'm looking at draft-duerst-iri-04 from the viewpoint of a provider\nof\n> >web server technology.

            "content": "Lloyd, Here are comments on http://www.honomichl.com/qa-date-format.html\n\n1) looks very good! Most of my comments are on minor points.\n\n2) On the comment that 8601 is computer friendly, I think it is also useful to\nusers, that sorting appears naturally-ordered.\n\n3) 8601 is not people unfriendly. I think it is very natural. Perhaps we can\nsay that people may prefer native formats.\n\n4) There is a third approach: declare the date format being used. For example:\nToday is 03/02/01 (yy/mm/dd).\n\nWhere this may be most useful is to alleviate the con about space in tables.\nIf you add the declaration, then the space requirement can be reduced while\nmaintaining y/m/d for universality:\ndate1date2\n(yy/mm/dd)(2003/mm/dd)\n03/02/0102/01\n03/02/0202/02\n...\n\nNote, the declaration for most pages only needs to be mentioned once per page\nto indicate \"this page presents dates in this format yyyy-mm-dd\", perhaps as a\nfootnote or in the introductory remarks.\n\n5) I am not sure about including the info on the possibility of a date tag.\nWhy should we present this?\nWhat should people do with the information? (can they indicate they approve or\ndisprove?)\n\nPerhaps this was due to confusion about the date-declaring approach #4 above.\nI had used the phrase \"to tag\" the date, by which I mean present in the text\nwhich format is being used.\n\n6) Is it worth mentioning that capitalization rules vary by locale and this\ncan affect how months are presented?\n\n7) The introduction says: \"The separators may be slashes, dashes or periods.\nSome locales print leading zeroes, others suppress them.\" but the page doesn't\nreally say anything about handling this. Should we comment on how important\nthis is? Do the programmatic solutions adequately address this?\n\nIs it worth mentioning that Asian languages might use asian characters as\nseparators and that the separator may vary between y, m, d?\n\n8) accept-language often gives a list of preferences. Suppose the list is \"en;\nq=1.0, fr; q=0.5\". \nSuppose the page returned is fr. But en has a higher q, should the en date\nformat be used or the fr?\n\nShould the date format be consistent with the content-language as opposed to\nthe accept-language?\n\n9) Perhaps we should offer a javascript routine? This is probably simpler for\npeople to use since it doesn't require server changes.\n\n10) should pros and cons of accept-language approach be listed as it is for\nthe universal date format?\nSomething like:\npro- may be closer to user's culture, allows page in one language to represent\nmore than one culture (I don't buy the en-US en-UK example of only the date\nchanging)\n\ncon- accept-language is meant to only select language. It is not necessarily\nindicative of date or other formats.\n\n\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

I also attached the Word version (if it's more\nhelpful). It might be a little easier to read.\n\nThis would more readily be categorized as \"introductory\" whereas the already\npublished questions could be categorized as \"advanced.\" I'll talk to you in\na little while.\n\nMany thanks,\nPhil\n\n\n--------------------------------------\nQuestions & Answers:  Benefits of internationalized code\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat are some benefits of utilizing international-friendly code on the\nInternet?\n\n\nBackground\n\nPeople of every culture and nation can view content on the Internet and\ncommunicate with its authors. Often times, this content can easily be\nmisunderstood because the formatting and presentation is not consistent with\ntheir local and cultural expectations. It is important for businesses to\ncommunicate the correct message to their visitors.\n\nWith some initial planning and the use of the proper markup languages, your\nsite can be structured so as to allow for content to both properly display\nforeign words, as well as format and present the content in the local\ncontext.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nUsing code that allows for localization will ensure that the meaning of the\ncontent is preserved, regardless of the reader's culture. Some of the\nbenefits of this are described here. \n\nA typical challenge is to ensure that characters display correctly for the\nend user. Standard HTML can easily accommodate English, Germanic, and\nRomantic languages, but what happens when an occasional foreign word or name\nis used? In the past, a quick solution was to use an inline graphic to\ndisplay the character. Another partial solution was to copy and paste the\ndesired character from another program into an HTML document. While the\nresult might look correct in one scenario, there is not a guarantee that\nevery user will see the same text. There are many variables that might need\nto be considered, such as font, operating system, browser software, etc. The\nuse of Unicode will ensure that every user will see the same content,\nregardless of the system or software they are using. This is becoming\nincreasingly important as users move toward mobile and other non-standard\nbrowsing devices.\n\nAs many languages read from right to left (RTL), the ability to include such\ncontent becomes an even greater challenge. In addition to the use of\nUnicode, content should be marked up using XML, and include a language\nattribute. When read by an XHTML page, the language attribute will adjust\nthe direction of the text so that it reads properly.\n\nThere are numerous benefits to using XML. Because the basis of XML is simply\nto define content, it does not define its presentation. The accompanying\nlanguage (such as XHTML) used for formatting and presentation will present\nthe content in the proper manner. For example, some cultures use a comma as\na thousands separator and a period as a decimal point, while other cultures\nuse the period and comma, respectively. 1,547 in Germany and 1.547 in the\nUnited States are actually the same number. When using the proper markup\nlanguages, the numbers will display appropriately for the audience.\n\nThere are many other variable elements that can cause confusion when not\nconverted and displayed properly. Some of these include the date and time\nformats, punctuation marks, and scientific characters.\n\n\nBy the way...\n\nThere is a little more initial work in building a site that allows for\nlocalization, but it is much simpler to add additional language and regional\ndata when the proper framework was first established. When beginning to\ndesign content, or migrate existing content, first consider all of the\npotential users of your site.\n\nIt is highly recommended to work with native speaking people who are\nfamiliar with the regions and cultures that are part of your user\ndemographic.\n\nWhen serving localized content to a user, it is best to in some way indicate\nor imply that they are viewing content that has been formatted for their\nviewing. This avoids questions and further misinterpretations.\n\n\nFurther information\n\nUnicode [ www.unicode.org ]\nXHTML [ www.w3.org/MarkUp ]\nXML [ www.w3.org/XML ]\n\n\"Questions & Answers: Date Formats\" [\nwww.w3.org/International/questions/qa-date-format.html ]\n\"Questions & Answers: Multilingual Forms\" [\nwww.w3.org/International/questions/qa-forms-utf-8.html ]\n\n\"Unicode in XML and other Markup Languages\" [ www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napplication/msword attachment: w3c_question_001.doc\n\n\n\n\n"

If you need to specify a font, choose fonts common to your target\naudience.\n\n\n\n2. When I look at my page I see square boxes instead of letters.\n\nMost fonts contain a small subset of all possible characters. Within\neach font there is a symbol used to indicate that the codepoint\nrepresenting a partucular character that is being displayed is not\npresent in the font. Commonly, the missing character is represented by a\nsquare or rectangle.\n\nChange your style sheet, and use a different font.\n\nIf square boxes display instead of the appropriate character, the font\nbeing used to display the page does not have the necessary characters in\nthe font.\n\n3. When I look at my page, the page appears to be a mix of random\ncharacters.\n\nIt is possible that the web browser is attempting to display your web\npage using the wrong character encoding. Please check that you have\nspecified the character encoding correctly within your webpage. In\naddition check to see if your web server is specifying a character\nencoding in the http header. Tools like web-sniffer\n[http://webtools.mozilla.org/web-sniffer/] allow you to view the http\nheader and web page being served by your web server.\n\n4. The language my web page is written in requires special fonts or\nsoftware to view.\n\nMost common and widely used languages are supported by either the\noperating system or the web browser. Some languages are more uncommon on\nthe web and may require very specific fonts, web browsers or font\nrendering technologies.\n\nIf you are creating a web page in a language that has specific technical\nconstraints, then it is advisable to provide information or links to the\nrequired fonts or software or alternatively, provide information on\nviewing the page.\n\n\n\n"

Because this is meant to act somewhat like an\nintroduction to our area, I felt that it was important to include some\nmention of these in order to provide the reader with suggested next steps\n(those being to learn a little more about each of the standards mentioned).\nI discussed them briefly under \"Further information.\"\n\nThanks,\nPhil\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-\nQuestions & Answers:  Initial considerations for international web sites\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat are some topics to consider when creating websites for an international\naudience?\n\n\nBackground\n\nPeople from around the world can view your content on websites. Because much\nof what we find on the web is written with a specific demographic in mind,\nit is often the case that people outside of that demographic misunderstand\nwhat has actually been intended. The formatting and presentation of text has\nvery specific regional and cultural requirements that need to be addressed\nif the content is to be properly understood.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nA typical challenge is to ensure that characters display correctly for the\nend user. Web pages can easily accommodate English, Germanic, and Romance\nlanguages, but what happens when an occasional foreign word or name is used?\nIn the past, a quick solution was to use an inline graphic to display the\ncharacter. Another method was to copy and paste the desired character from\nanother program into the web page. While the result might look correct for\none user, there is no guarantee that every user will see the same text.\nThere are many variables that might need to be considered, such as the font,\noperating system, browser software, etc. These concerns are becoming\nincreasingly important as users move toward mobile and other non-standard\nbrowsing devices.\n\nAs many languages read from right to left, the ability to include such\ncontent becomes an even greater challenge. In addition to identifying the\nproper characters, there also needs to be a method of properly handling this\ntext.\n\nSome cultures use a comma as a thousands separator and a period as a decimal\npoint, while other cultures use the period and comma, respectively. For\nexample, 1,547 in Germany and 1.547 in the United States are actually the\nsame number. While the only difference in this example is a single\ncharacter, the difference in meaning is significant.\n\nThe presentation of dates and times are a very typical example of something\nthat causes confusion for the user. When using two digits each to represent\nyear, month, and day, the actual date might not be obvious. A few examples\nfrom different cultures include DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, and YY/MM/DD. A single\ndate in the format \"xx/xx/xx\" could be interpreted as three different dates.\n\nThere are many other concerns that should be addressed as well when creating\nan international-friendly site. This is only a sampling of some of these.\n\n\nBy the way...\n\nIn its simplest definition, \"internationalization\" refers to creating a site\nframework that allows for content to be presented in a way that is\nconsistent with regional styles and cultural customs. \"Localization\" refers\nto the actual implementation of each specific region's content into the\ninternational framework. Internationalization is commonly referred to as\n\"i18n\" because there are 18 characters between the beginning \"i\" and\nconcluding \"n.\" Similarly, localization is commonly referred to as \"l10n.\"\n\nWhen starting to create an internationalized site, one must first give\nconsideration to the various locales that need to be considered. This will\nhelp to define the requirements for the international framework. It is\nhighly recommended to work with native speaking people who are very familiar\nwith the regions and cultures that are part of your user demographic.\n\nMost importantly, the end user must understand that a page has been\nlocalized. It is a good practice to indicate or imply that the content has\nbeen formatted for their local formats. This avoids questions and possible\nmisinterpretations.\n\n\nFurther information\n\nThis Q&A provides only a few introductory points on this topic. There are\nmany books devoted to the topics of internationalization and localization.\nBecoming familiar with the styles and customs of other regions and properly\nimplementing these elements into a web site will ensure that content is\navailable to -- and truly understandable by -- a larger audience. \n\nSome of the standards typically used to create internationalized web sites\ninclude the following:\n\n- XML [ www.w3.org/XML ] is the preferred markup language for defining\ncontent. In addition to identifying the actual content, it can also include\nattributes that further define aspects of the content (such as language,\ngrammar style, and current format of the content). Other web languages (such\nas XHTML) use these attributes to deliver the localized page appropriate for\nthe current user.\n\n- XHTML [ www.w3.org/MarkUp ] is the successor to HTML, and is a markup\nlanguage used to define web pages and  to properly format and display XML\ncontent within them.\n\n- Unicode [ www.unicode.org ] is a numbered collection of the characters of\nall of the languages in the world. Using this standard ensures that the\ncorrect character will be displayed, regardless of the browser or system.\n\nProperly utilizing these standards in a web site can ensure that the\nconcerns mentioned above are properly handled.\n\n\n\n"

Change\n\nHow can I check the HTTP headers with which my Web documents are served?\nto something like:\n\nHow can I verify the value of CHARSET in the HTTP headers served with my web\ndocuments?\n\n3) When describing that the reader should look for \"charset=\", it should be\nmentioned that it may not be provided.\nThey should look for Content-type and confirm that charset is provided and\nthen confirm the value associated with it.\nOtherwise people may look for charset and not realize they are looking at a\ncontent-type with no charset setting.\n\n4) When I use the validator with xhtml it gives me some warning about not\ndetecting or using charsets and using some default, if I recall. I can go\nretry it if needed. Before we document using the validator, does it work\nproperly with xhtml and encodings now?\n\n5) in the paragraph on the extended interface, the reference to conversions is\nperhaps confusing. Also the specific use of UTF-8. Perhaps, the text should\nmention that pages should be served with the correct charset for the content\nof the page.

We\nshould watch for assumptions that the audience is western european. ;-)\nPerhaps eliminate that reference altogether and just talk about introducing\nforeign words.\n\n3) It might be good if each paragraph had a topic heading to make it easy for\npeople to identify the subtopic.\ncharacter encoding and display.\nreading direction.\nnumber formats.\ndate and time formats.\n\nThen, we can also add topics to this question easily if each para has its own\nheading and text.\n\n4) Perhaps the \"By the way\" would be better as a separate Q&A. We certainly\nneed to cover the terms and abbreviations.\nConsider creating a \"What is internationalization, localization, i18n, l10n?\"\nq&a with essentially the same text.\n\n5) Perhaps add a reference to the already published date-time question from\nthe date-time para.\n\n6) On reading direction- I don't know if I would say \"many\" languages. It is\ncertainly more than a few, but it is not a substantial percentage of\nlanguages. (I think.) Sorry if this seems picky. I am just looking to avoid\nmisleading people about the relative importance of RTL.\n\nAlso, reading direction is more than text processing, since it affects the\noverall layout and organization of the pages (graphics, etc. change too). This\nbears commenting.\n\n7) We might offer a list at the end without further explanation of the other\nitems to consider for a global web site:\nterminology\ncalendars, work hours, holidays\ncurrency, taxes and financial rules\ngraphics and images significance\ncolor significance\nsound signficance\nmeasurement systems\npage and form sizes\ntitles and address formats\nlaws and legal references\nothers?\n\n8) By leaving off HTML in the standards list, are we implying it is\nnon-international?\nI think this list of standards is not helpful as it is. It leaves off RFC 3066\nand perhaps others that are relevant to web i18n.\nI think it might be a good idea once we have a more complete list.\n\nHowever, I like the idea of providing some ideas for the reader as to where to\ngo to get more information.\nIf you want, I have a list of websites with checklists and relevant info that\nyou can pick up some pages to cite.\nI would suggest using an entry for each of the major software vendors\n(microsoft, sun, ibm, oracle, netscape, etc.) as well as some of the\ntutorial/educational sites (e.g. multilingual webmaster).\nLook at http://www.i18nguy.com/guidelines.html and pick some you like.\nAlso reference the web i18n tutorial and some of the other links elsewhere on\nthe w3c/international site.\n\nI think the question is a good intro to the topic and sets the stage well for\nthe other questions.\nHope the comments are helpful.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestions & Answers:  Initial considerations for international web sites\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat are some topics to consider when creating websites for an international\naudience?\n\n\nBackground\n\nPeople from around the world can view your content on websites. Because much\nof what we find on the web is written with a specific demographic in mind,\nit is often the case that people outside of that demographic misunderstand\nwhat has actually been intended. The formatting and presentation of text has\nvery specific regional and cultural requirements that need to be addressed\nif the content is to be properly understood.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nA typical challenge is to ensure that characters display correctly for the\nend user. Web pages can easily accommodate English, Germanic, and Romance\nlanguages, but what happens when an occasional foreign word or name is used?\nIn the past, a quick solution was to use an inline graphic to display the\ncharacter. Another method was to copy and paste the desired character from\nanother program into the web page. While the result might look correct for\none user, there is no guarantee that every user will see the same text.\nThere are many variables that might need to be considered, such as the font,\noperating system, browser software, etc. These concerns are becoming\nincreasingly important as users move toward mobile and other non-standard\nbrowsing devices.\n\nAs many languages read from right to left, the ability to include such\ncontent becomes an even greater challenge. In addition to identifying the\nproper characters, there also needs to be a method of properly handling this\ntext.\n\nSome cultures use a comma as a thousands separator and a period as a decimal\npoint, while other cultures use the period and comma, respectively. For\nexample, 1,547 in Germany and 1.547 in the United States are actually the\nsame number. While the only difference in this example is a single\ncharacter, the difference in meaning is significant.\n\nThe presentation of dates and times are a very typical example of something\nthat causes confusion for the user. When using two digits each to represent\nyear, month, and day, the actual date might not be obvious. A few examples\nfrom different cultures include DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, and YY/MM/DD. A single\ndate in the format \"xx/xx/xx\" could be interpreted as three different dates.\n\nThere are many other concerns that should be addressed as well when creating\nan international-friendly site. This is only a sampling of some of these.\n\n\nBy the way...\n\nIn its simplest definition, \"internationalization\" refers to creating a site\nframework that allows for content to be presented in a way that is\nconsistent with regional styles and cultural customs. \"Localization\" refers\nto the actual implementation of each specific region's content into the\ninternational framework. Internationalization is commonly referred to as\n\"i18n\" because there are 18 characters between the beginning \"i\" and\nconcluding \"n.\" Similarly, localization is commonly referred to as \"l10n.\"\n\nWhen starting to create an internationalized site, one must first give\nconsideration to the various locales that need to be considered. This will\nhelp to define the requirements for the international framework. It is\nhighly recommended to work with native speaking people who are very familiar\nwith the regions and cultures that are part of your user demographic.\n\nMost importantly, the end user must understand that a page has been\nlocalized. It is a good practice to indicate or imply that the content has\nbeen formatted for their local formats. This avoids questions and possible\nmisinterpretations.\n\n\nFurther information\n\nThis Q&A provides only a few introductory points on this topic. There are\nmany books devoted to the topics of internationalization and localization.\nBecoming familiar with the styles and customs of other regions and properly\nimplementing these elements into a web site will ensure that content is\navailable to -- and truly understandable by -- a larger audience. \n\nSome of the standards typically used to create internationalized web sites\ninclude the following:\n\n- XML [ www.w3.org/XML ] is the preferred markup language for defining\ncontent. In addition to identifying the actual content, it can also include\nattributes that further define aspects of the content (such as language,\ngrammar style, and current format of the content). Other web languages (such\nas XHTML) use these attributes to deliver the localized page appropriate for\nthe current user.\n\n- XHTML [ www.w3.org/MarkUp ] is the successor to HTML, and is a markup\nlanguage used to define web pages and  to properly format and display XML\ncontent within them.\n\n- Unicode [ www.unicode.org ] is a numbered collection of the characters of\nall of the languages in the world. Using this standard ensures that the\ncorrect character will be displayed, regardless of the browser or system.\n\nProperly utilizing these standards in a web site can ensure that the\nconcerns mentioned above are properly handled.\n\n\n\n"

Instead of explaining\none solution (the wrong one) in the background, explain the problem\n(multiple nested (i.e. structured) pieces of rtl and ltr text) and\nthe abstract solution (identification of these pieces).\nUse terms such as base directionality and embedding (and later\noverride) without actually mentioning the control characters.\n\nThen the answer can directly explain the markup solution.\n\n\n\n> > - It is unclear to everybody except readers of Hebrew (i.e. also\n> >    readers of Arabic) why the first example in 'background' is wrong.\n>\n>The sentence immediately before it explains that though, doesn't it?\n>(btw, I considered adding \"Incorrect: \" before this example - need to\n>add some styling for that to distinguish from the example itself.)\n\nIt only says \"This is incorrect.

They are controls also so it makes the table complete. The text could\nperhaps be dealt with in comments or jointly commented and in the surrounding\ntext. It's fairly short so no need for a BTW.\n\n3) I would add the name of the controls and scalar value into the column in\nthe table rather than the bullet list in the background. Perhaps use a smaller\nfont if you want to conserve space. I would change the heading of the column\nfrom \"unicode\" to \"bidi control code\" or some such.\n\n4) Since bidi is not well-supported by browsers and since I hate to force\npeople to click to evaluate whether they are seeing the right thing or not, I\nwould embed the images inline in this case, rather than use an image button.\nI would leave the text versions as well so people can easily evaluate if their\nbrowser is doing the right thing.\n\n5) In references I would add a link to the unicode chapter on bidi, at the\nunicode site.\n\n6) Should we note some of the the places where people might use bidi in\nattributes which do not accept markup?

I have used your information to produce a\n>new draft of my Q&A.\n>\n>  http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-space.html\n\nHere are some comments. I have reduced the cross-posting.\n\nI think this is a very good topic for Q&A, a small issue with\nan easy answer, supported by the specs.\n\nIn the question \"Why does my browser\" is a good way to connect\nto the reader, but this Q&A is for Web authors, and we should\nget them away from the impression that their browser is what\ncounts. So \"Why do browsers\" is much better. If we want to\nstay personal, we can add \"in my Web pages\" at the end.\n\nBackground: reduce the 'may' and 'would', i.e.\n    \"text may appear to collapse\" -> \"text collapses\"\n    \"Would produce a result that looks as follows\" ->\n    \"produces the following result\"\n\nAlignment of images: I would align them to the left. Especially on\n    a wide page, it is more difficult for the readers to follow\n    the flow of the argument.\n\nAnswer: \"If the previous section describes the look of your code,\":\n    \"code\" -> \"markup\"\n\n    Better align the text before and after the example. Currently, we\n    have 'remove space or dir' before the example, and then\n    'remove dir or <span>' afterwards. This overlap is confusing.\n\n    I would also add (here or at some other place) that the answer\n    is a specific instance of two more general principles:\n    1) Keep your markup tight around the text you mark up.\n    2) Keep your markup and the text you mark up balanced.\n       (i.e. don't use (<span>W3C)</span> or so)\n    These principles are helpful in general, but of particular\n    importance for bidi markup.\n\nHow does it look for me?: Again, this is the wrong viewpoint to\n    ask for authors. And because we know now what the spec\n    requests, we can probably reduce the list of examples.\n    Also, again, 'code' -> 'markup'\n\nTechnical detail:\n\n    \"Only read this section if you want the gory details about why\n     this happens.\": The title should be enough to help the\n    readers decide whether they want to read this part.\n\n    \"The specifications listed in the sources section below\":\n    Use the actual names, and provide links.\n\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n\n"

The examples are very nice.\n\nFor the table of differences, I would consider using color background to\nhighlight the differences, rather than relying on the text alongside. I would\nkeep that text as well.\n\nI am not sure when you reference the GB standard whether you are refering to\n2312 or the more recent 18030.\nThere is also a 13000 I believe which is GB for Unicode. 18030 has both simp.\nand trad.\n(Numbers from memory- could be wrong.)\n\nIf you convert it to Q&A, I would make it several questions. The way it is\nwritten, each of the subsections could stand alone pretty much the way they\nare.

Good stuff, might also include tutorials,\npowerpoints, and other stuff we have occasion to produce.\n\nIf we had a good stuff area, I think it would be a better use of time to\nextend the tutorial with a TOC, and an index (for ease of search) and continue\nto add more info on chinese characters- sorting choices, fonts, input methods,\n...\nthank to lose a week or so to convert to q&A.\n\nAlso, the iana registry now has zh-hans and zh-hant for simp. and trad.\nI wonder if you should be using those instead of zh-tw, zh-cn now?\n\nwould also be a good q&a? which tags to use for chinese?\nI'll claim that for my next Q&A- should be cheap!\ntex\n\nRichard Ishida wrote:\n> \n> I wrote up some stuff to answer a question someone asked of me: \"What's\n> the difference between Simplified & Traditional Chinese, and are they\n> separate in Unicode?\"\n> \n> http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/chinese/\n> \n> It's slightly different in style that what we've done so far - more like\n> background info, longer, and not specific to W3C technology.\n> \n> Would it make a good addition to our Q&A list?\n> \n> If we added it, I assume / prefer we would make a copy in the standard\n> Q&A format (though we should probably cross-reference the two to reduce\n> confusion).\n> \n> What do you think?\n> \n> RI\n> \n> ============\n> Richard Ishida\n> W3C\n> \n> tel: +44 1753 480 292\n> http://www.w3.org/International/\n> http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

Online  <http://www.poynter.org/seminar/search.asp?sid=26> Seminars\n\n\nKnow your audience\n\nBells and whistles impress techies, but readers want sites that are\ninformative and easy to navigate. In other words, we want to write long,\nbut our readers want to read short.\n\nJakob Nielsen, a web usability researcher and engineer, has done study\nafter study saying web readers don't read. They scan. Not only that, but\nthey scan when they should be working, so they're in a hurry to get news\nnuggets before the boss comes around the cubicle. Our hypothetical\nscanners with the suspicious bosses will only give a story a few seconds\nto get and hold their attention. So online stories should:\n\n*Have informative subheads. \n\n*Use bold type on proper nouns or important points. \n\n*Use bulleted lists. \n\n*Keep paragraphs short (one idea). \n\n*Have pictures or graphics. Remember the broadcast maxim: \"See\ncow, don't say cow.\"\n\nThe form it takes\n\nThat means web stories should be cookie-cutter bland and formulaic,\nright? Hardly. They can be as creative as time and the boss will allow,\nbut how we write and how we work a story are different. It's not our\ngrandparents' news anymore.\n\nWrite to add depth. Layers can use text to explain why the story matters\n(as a print story would), allow the audience to hear or see human drama\n(like broadcast stories), and engage readers interactively.\n\nHere's a synopsis, without examples: (For examples, go to\nwww.cyberjournalist.net/storyforms.htm)\n\n*Clickable interactive: graphics or other elements that add to\nthe depth of a story. \n\n*Slideshows (with or without audio): photos with cutlines for\nstrong visual stories. \n\n*Surveys: questions and answers on a topic.\n\nSuggestion 1: Make it tight and bright!\n\n*Don't write a mystery novel. Tell the readers the ending right\naway. (\"She cut her hair to earn money to buy him a watch; he sold his\nwatch to buy her some brushes.\") \n\n*Use subject-verb-object sentences. (\"You didn't!\" they both\nexclaimed.) \n\n*Use active voice and action verbs to express connotation and\ndenotation. (\"What a strange Christmas this has been,\" they said.) \n\n*Avoid overusing adjectives and adverbs. (\"Stop this!\" O. Henry\nthundered.)\n\nSuggestion 2: Explain\n\nReaders want to know not only who, what, when, and where, but also why\nthe story is important. Why are city taxes going up? What will it mean\nto essential services? Use links to help amplify without adding words.\n\nDon't bury the lede and don't pile on when updating. With each update,\nbe sure the story is complete and cut out the superfluous text from\nprevious versions.\n\nSuggestion 3: Banish gray\n\nLong gray or black blocks of type are deadly. Think: Can the info be\nbetter presented in a graph, chart, or table? Can the sentences and\ngrafs be shorter? Punchier?\n\nReaders want their info NOW. So web writing should be scannable and\nsplitable.\n\n*Scannability: Highlight key words or phrases to make a point.\nBriefly repeat such info from time to time in new ways. \n\n*Splitability: Break some info off into links that are also in\ninverted pyramid style so that there is what Nielsen calls \"a set of\npyramids floating in cyberspace.\"\n\nSuggestion 4: Link, link, link!\n\nSince the hed will likely be the first line of a link, make sure it is\nstraightforward and succinct. Let readers know what they're getting for\ntheir click.\n\nWe want to write long, but our readers want to read short.Don't be\nafraid to link deep within a site instead of just to top pages. No\nreader wants to go to the top page and then search. Also, check and see\nif a site is available; don't trust someone's word that it is or will\nbe.\n\nAnd if you link to a specific geographic location, hyperlink to a map to\nshow readers where it is.\n\nConsider using internal links for navigational ease.\n\nThat was 764 words. Both Roys -- Rogers and Clark -- would be pleased. \n\n[ What\n<http://www.poynter.org/article_feedback/article_feedback_add.asp?id=353\n78> is your advice to someone writing for the web? ] \n\nJoe Marren is an assistant professor in the communication department at\nBuffalo State College.

            "content": "Question & Answer: International & multilingual web sites\n\n\nQuestion\n\nWhat is an \"international\" or a \"multilingual\" website?\n\n\nBackground\n\n\"International\" and \"multilingual\" are two words that are sometimes used\ninterchangeably, but they can have very specific meanings when they pertain\nto web sites. It is important to clearly distinguish between these two\nwords. Understanding the differences can help you more precisely plan and\ndefine requirements for a site. There are very specific requirements with\nrespect to the design, development, and deployment, and they could call for\ndifferent technical solutions.\n\n\nAnswer\n\nSimply stated, an \"international\" web site is one that is intended for an\ninternational audience, and a \"multilingual\" web site refers to a web site\nthat uses more than one language. An international web site may or may not\nbe multilingual, just as a multilingual web site may or may not be\ninternational. For example, the W3C's site is an international site because\nit is intended for an international audience. While this site is primarily\nwritten in English, there are some pages that contain other languages,\nthereby making the site multilingual as well.\n\nThe global home pages of many companies are often international in nature.\nBeing intended for international audiences, they often ask the user to\nselect a regional site. Such pages tend to be in a single language (usually\nthe common language for the majority of the expected audience). The regional\nselection might direct the user to a sub-site within the same domain, or it\nmight direct to a website in a different country. Regardless of the method,\na good consistent design will make the user feel that it is still the part\nof the same site, and retain the feeling of an international site.\n\nMultilingual sites can exist in several forms. A site might offer language\nselection and then present the content in only a single language at a time.\nThe language selector itself can exist in one of two ways: each language can\nbe presented in the current language (such as \"English, French, German\" when\nEnglish is the current language) or in the respective language (such as\n\"English, Fran?ais, Deutsch\"). \n\nA multilingual web page might also mix multiple languages within the same\npage, either because the audience is believed to be multilingual, or because\nthere might be a need for a foreign word or phrase. An online foreign\ndictionary is a common example of such a site.\n\nUnderstanding the international and multilingual requirements for a site\nwill help to determine and define the file structure of the site, the\nhardware and software requirements, the structure and markup of the content,\nand provide valuable input for designers to allow for possible scenarios in\npresentation. Revising any of these later is a significantly greater\nchallenge then allowing for the possibility of international and\nmultilingual aspects from the beginning.\n\n\nBy the way...\n\nA multilingual site is concerned with more than just the language. There are\nmany regional and cultural differences in the way that information is\ndisplayed. Some cultures use a comma as a thousands separator and a period\nas a decimal point, while other cultures use the period and comma,\nrespectively. For example, 1,547 in one country and 1.547 in another country\nmight actually be the same number. While the only difference in this example\nis a single character, the difference in meaning is significant.\n\nThe presentation of dates and times are a very typical example of something\nthat causes confusion for the user. When using two digits each to represent\nyear, month, and day, the actual date might not be obvious. A few examples\nfrom different cultures include DD/MM/YY, MM/DD/YY, and YY/MM/DD. A single\ndate in the format \"xx/xx/xx\" could be interpreted as three different dates.\n\nThere are many other concerns that should also be addressed when creating a\nmultilingual site (such as punctuation, text that reads from right to left,\ndisplaying prices in multiple currencies). This is only a sampling of some\nof these.\n\n\nFurther information\n\nFollowing are links to related W3C content:\n\nHints & Tips: Date & Time: [ <http://www.w3.org/International/O-time.html> ]\nHints & Tips: Language Tagging in HTML and XML: [\n<http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html> ]\nQuestions & Answers: (X)HMTL & bidi formatting codes vs. markup: [\n<http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls.html> ]\nQuestions & Answers: Multilingual Forms [\n<http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-forms-utf-8.html> ]\n\n\n\n"

Before 4th-generation user agents, there\nwas a lot of undefined and accidental behavior. As of 4th-generation\nand later user agents, the rule is to send back form data in the\nencoding that the document was interpreted by the browser.\nThis is not very well described in HTML4, it mainly appears in the\nsentence \"The default value for this attribute is the reserved\nstring \"UNKNOWN\". User agents may interpret this value as the\ncharacter encoding that was used to transmit the document\ncontaining this FORM element.\" in the description of the\n(rarely used and not widely implemented?) accept-charset attribute\n(see http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#adef-accept-charset).\n\n??? say something about method='POST' (vs. GET), and\nenctype='multipart/form-data' (vs. application/x-www-form-urlencoded).\n\n\nThe major alternatives are (choose one per site, or at least\nper form handler (the URI in the action attribute of the <form>\nelement)):\n\n1. Use UTF-8 throughout\n\n    advantages:\n        - Allows to use the same form handler for forms in many different \nlanguages.\n        - Does not limit set of characters that can be input and transmitted.\n        - Allows form request URIs to be displayed as IRIs.\n        - Allows form to be converted to XForms (which requires UTF-8 for\n          GET requests) without changing form handler.\n\n    subtechnique: check that what you got back is really UTF-8\n       Although extremely rare, there may still be accidentally\n       very old user agents out there that mess things up. Also,\n       for whatever reason, the user might accidentally have\n       forced the user agent to use a different encoding.\n       It is therefore helpful to check that the data that comes\n       back in from the form is really UTF-8. This can be done\n       by checking the byte pattern of the data.\n       (background reading: The Properties and Promizes of UTF-8, M.J. Du\"rst,\n        11th International Unicode Conference -1- San Jose, September 1997,\n        http://www.ifi.unizh.ch/mml/mduerst/papers/PDF/IUC11-UTF-8.pdf)\n\n       Actual implementation:\n          Perl: See the regular expression in the subroutine\n          check_utf8 in the W3C HTML/XML validator at e.g.\n          http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check?rev=1.322&c \nhttp://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/check?rev=1.322&content-typ \ne=text/x-cvsweb-markup\n\n\n2. Know the encoding you sent out\n\n    If documents in different encodings are served, then it is important\n    to know what encoding was served, because form results will (usually)\n    come back in the same encoding. One way to do this is to use\n    different form handlers for different encodings. But this may result\n    in significant code duplication, and may be difficult to upgrade.\n    Another way to do this is to include a hidden field containing the\n    encoding. This field is sent back to the form processor without the\n    user seeing it. (check: Microsoft Internet Explorer places the\n    actual encoding used into the field if the field has the name\n    ???? (check, provide reference, move to specific implementations))\n\n\nLimitations: Both techniques described above rely on the document not being\ntranscoded when sent to the user agent. The exceptions know to this are:\n1) Some servers in Russia transcode HTML documents before sending them out\ndepending on the operating system of the user agent. 2) Some gateways\n(working as HTTP proxies) to user agents on mobile phones convert to a\nsingle encoding known by the mobile phone. A variant of the 'hidden field'\ntechnique can be used to trace code conversions on the way to the user\nagent: Some well-known text string is placed in a hidden field. This\ntext string will be converted like the rest of the document, and will\nbe sent to the form processor. The form processor can the determine\nthe encoding of that text string by comparing it to transcoded versions\nof the text string, and can interpret the other parameters sent to\nthe form as being in the same encoding.\n\n\nAdditional technique (applies in all cases):\n\n   Make sure the character encoding of the form page is recognized correctly\n\n    Because form results are sent back in the encoding of the document\n    that contains the form, it is crucial\n    that the user agent recognizes the encoding of the form page correctly.\n    This can be assured in two ways (ideally use both):\n    1. Follow the techniques given in section 3.2 for specifying\n       the character encoding\n    2. Include some appropriate non-ASCII text in the page so that the\n       user is able to see whether the user agent recognized the\n       character encoding of the forms page correctly.\n\nNotes on specific implementations:\n   Browser side:\n     Microsoft Internet Explorer (V. 4-5.5, verify for 6) posts data as\n     UTF-8 for all Unicode-based encodings (e.g. UTF-16), for both\n     application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data\n     (source: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;303612)\n\n   Server side:\n     Java servlets (add versions here!) interpret incoming form data as \niso-8859-1.\n     The interpretation of the data has to be changed to UTF-8 (or whatever \nelse\n     it actually is). This can be done by interpreting the parameter as bytes\n     based on iso-8859-1, and then recreating a String from the bytes based on\n     UTF-8 (or whatever other encoding).\n     Example:\n     String field = new String \n(request.getParameter(\"fieldname\").getBytes(\"iso-8859-1\"), \"utf-8\");\n     See e.g. also the 'process' method at\n     http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/rdf/examples/ARPServlet.j \nhttp://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/rdf/examples/ARPServlet.java?r \nev=1.70&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

(check, provide reference, move to specific implementations))\n\n\nLimitations: Both techniques described above rely on the document not being\ntranscoded when sent to the user agent. The exceptions know to this are:\n1) Some servers in Russia transcode HTML documents before sending them out\ndepending on the operating system of the user agent. 2) Some gateways\n(working as HTTP proxies) to user agents on mobile phones convert to a\nsingle encoding known by the mobile phone. A variant of the 'hidden field'\ntechnique can be used to trace code conversions on the way to the user\nagent: Some well-known text string is placed in a hidden field. This\ntext string will be converted like the rest of the document, and will\nbe sent to the form processor. The form processor can the determine\nthe encoding of that text string by comparing it to transcoded versions\nof the text string, and can interpret the other parameters sent to\nthe form as being in the same encoding.\n\n\nAdditional technique (applies in all cases):\n\n   Make sure the character encoding of the form page is recognized correctly\n\n    Because form results are sent back in the encoding of the document\n    that contains the form, it is crucial\n    that the user agent recognizes the encoding of the form page correctly.\n    This can be assured in two ways (ideally use both):\n    1. Follow the techniques given in section 3.2 for specifying\n       the character encoding\n    2. Include some appropriate non-ASCII text in the page so that the\n       user is able to see whether the user agent recognized the\n       character encoding of the forms page correctly.\n\nNotes on specific implementations:\n   Browser side:\n     Microsoft Internet Explorer (V. 4-5.5, verify for 6) posts data as\n     UTF-8 for all Unicode-based encodings (e.g. UTF-16), for both\n     application/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data\n     (source: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;303612)\n\n   Server side:\n     Java servlets (add versions here!) interpret incoming form data as \niso-8859-1.\n     The interpretation of the data has to be changed to UTF-8 (or whatever \nelse\n     it actually is). This can be done by interpreting the parameter as bytes\n     based on iso-8859-1, and then recreating a String from the bytes based on\n     UTF-8 (or whatever other encoding).\n     Example:\n     String field = new String \n(request.getParameter(\"fieldname\").getBytes(\"iso-8859-1\"), \"utf-8\");\n     See e.g. also the 'process' method at\n     http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/rdf/examples/ARPServlet.j \nhttp://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/java/classes/org/w3c/rdf/examples/ARPServlet.java?r \nev=1.70&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"

And\nsomewhere along that line the preference for how to do it may flop over.\n\nIt's not clear which way the overhead is greater.  A 'span' on each instance\ncould be much more size overhead when compared with a single glossary entry.\nBut the latter is more risky because it is more indirect.\n\nI am trying very hard not to prejudge the choice, here, because in a\nmigration strategy for an incompatible change I believe that there is a\nplace for more than one way of doing things, and that we should not rush to\njudgement on how it is to be done.\n\nAs I said at the end of the day Wednesday, what I am hoping the community\nwill develop is better discernment about when to use which manner of\nannotation, inline and offline.

At this stage I don't think what\nI did is possible in other Annotea tools, but it should be relatively simple\nto adapt them.\n\nThis approach could be used by any tools for any well-formed XML (including\nXHTML but not including old-fashioned HTML), but it seems to me a repair\nstrategy - where possible I would markup languages that allowed as much of\nthis as possible to be done in the document itself.\n\nThis is the annotation stored (I numbered parts for easy reference - the\nnumbers don't appear in the annotation itself):\n\n1. <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n2. <r:RDF xmlns:d=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/\"\n       xmlns:t=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/03/thread#\"\n       xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#\"\n       xmlns:r=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\">\n3.     <a:Annotation\na:context=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/anno-acc/demo.html#xpointer(string-range(/html[1]/head[1]/title[1],&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,19,6))\"\n                  d:title=\"Annotation of Demonstration for SWAD-E techniques\"\n                  d:language=\"en\"\n                  a:created=\"2003/03/14 12:09:30 GMT+0\"\n                  d:date=\"2003/03/14 13:22:00 GMT+0\"\n                  d:creator=\"charles\"\n                  r:about=\"http://localhost:8080/zanno/annot1047644522.25\">\n4.       <r:type\nr:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotationType#Comment\"/>\n5.       <a:annotates\nr:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/anno-acc/demo.html\"/>\n6.       <a:body\nr:resource=\"http://localhost:8080/zanno/annot1047644522.25/annotationBody\"/>\n7.     </a:Annotation>\n\n\n8. </r:RDF>\n\ncheers\n\nChaals\n\nOn Fri, 14 Mar 2003, Charles McCathieNevile wrote:\n\n>\n>Hi folks,\n>\n>I am working up a demo now.

Assuming that you\nwant to use 'Piazza San Marco' as the ALT for an image, but the bulk\nlanguage of the text is not Italian, introduce the foreign phrase\nconversationally in the text before it is used in an epigrammatic way in the\nexhibit.\n\nIf you can't find it in your heart to take the text space to introduce the\nforeign phrase in the text, don't use it in the attribute.  Very rarely will\nthese guidelines leave you with nothing good to do.\n\nOn the other hand, hoping for the smarter tools is all we can do in any case.\nFor the old version of the language or the new improved version of the\nlanguage.  There is a reasonable chance that switching language models on\nthe fly will come to be the norm for TTS systems in the next few years, but\nit is certainly not the norm now.  So content has to be prepared to survive\nas communication with the screen reader which reads the whole page in one\nlanguage anyway.\n\nYes, we want to clean this up in XHTML 2.0.\n\nBut our change proposals have to be very well thought out (by the time they\nhit the HTML user community) and our follow-up promotion during \"life after\nRec\" for the reformed version of the language will have to be sensitive to\nthe problems faced by our customers, the content developers, in managing the\ntransition across incompatible versions.\n\nThe whole value of the Web is its universal interoperability.  And we are\nthreatening to mess with that in one dimension to improve it in another.\nThis has to be done carefully, and diplomatically.\n\nAl\n\nPS:\n\nOn a personal level, all that I said above is really going to cramp *my*\nstyle.  My personal version of English contains a lot of latin, French, and\nChinese idioms.  Maybe a little Yiddish.  I use these as if they were\nEnglish without thinking.  But I eventually learned from sad experience in\nworking in the WAI that foreign phrases are not second-language-safe\nvocabulary.  My French colleagues who are so good in English that I forget\nit is not their natural language do not know the same Yiddish phrases that I\ndo, and, I was shocked to realize, not the Latin borrowings either such as\n\"i.e., e.g.\" and so forth.\n\nSo for an international readership in *any* natural language, there are\nreasons to avoid sprinkling in borrowed terms from other languages.  Because\nthere is a large audience for whom the dominant language of the current text\nis usable as a second language, but where the third-language vocabulary will\nbe opaque, the sense inaccessible.\n\nWe (PF) would like to migrate Web media to a language-use and\nlanguage-usage-explanation platform that improves on this situation for\nforeign language borrowings, for Terms of Art in technical literature, etc.\nWCAG 4.3 where it says \"explain at first use\" is a very print-oriented rule.\nIt is not the most implementable form of an effective guideline, from the\nAT perspective.

If we try to change in these three areas piecemeal, the changes\nare likely simply never to take hold in general practice.\n\nWe will have more on \"how this could work\" shortly.

            "content": "I wonder how realistic these scenarios are. The principal motivation for a\nfine-grained language tagging of individual words or phrases appears to be\nfor text-to-speech, primarily for the blind. But the goal for\ntext-to-speech, except in very rare cases, will be to read the customary,\nmost-well-understood pronunciation of the phrase in the end-user's language.\nRarely will that precisely match the exact pronunciation of the word in the\nforeign language. More typically it will be modified to fit within an\nallowable sequence of phonemes in the user's language, and often it will be\ngiven a \"spelling pronunciation\". In that, it is much more like an equally\nobscure non-foreign word in the user's language. For example, an English\ntext-to-speech system should be more likely to find a relatively common\nYiddish term like \"schlemiel\" than to find an uncommon \"native\" word such as\n\"phthisic\" in English.\n\nIf the goal is to provide special pronunciations for unusual phrases, or\nphrases that are pronounced unusually in the given context, then it may be\nappropriate to have annotations: but annotations of the common\npronunciation, not of the language. So for that reason, it may be reasonable\nto have fine-grained annotations. But it would be most useful to explore\nfirst (a) what the actual requirements for text-to-speech are, and (b)\nwhether people find it, in practice, relatively easy to work around the\nrestrictions of attributes or elements that don't allow substructure.\n\n[That being said, I have always found the attributes that end up being\ndisplayed to the user, such as alt and title, very confining. It would be\nbetter to have elements that correspond to them, so that the text display\ncan be richer, such as italicising or bolding a word within them.]\n\nMark\n________\nmark.davis@jtcsv.com\nIBM, MS 50-2/B11, 5600 Cottle Rd, SJ CA 95193\n(408) 256-3148\nfax: (408) 256-0799\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Al Gilman\" <asgilman@iamdigex.net>\nTo: \"Roberto Scano - IWA/HWG\" <rscano@iwa-italy.org>; <ishida@w3.org>;\n<w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org>; <public-i18n-geo@w3.org>\nCc: <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>\nSent: Friday, March 14, 2003 05:30\nSubject: Re: Re[2]: FW: acronym in title...\n\n\n>\n> At 04:29 AM 2003-03-14, Roberto Scano - IWA/HWG wrote:\n>\n> >So, at least, for the \"previous\" version all we can do is to \"hope\" to\n> >have - for example - intelligent text readers that read the words in the\n> >natural language...\n>\n> Not at all.\n>\n> The approach that John Foliot laid out\n>\n>   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003JanMar/0800.html\n>\n> will produce graceful and communicative results in the vast majority of\ncases.\n>\n> You just realize that you can't indicate more than one natural language\nfor\n> the attributes of one element.

Languages based on images are used by a number of\npeople who are restricted to communicating through a board that lets them\nselect images.\n\nLikewise, Voice applications are being generated which allow a limited range\nof choices to accomplish a task. And people are interested not just in what\n'Piazzo San Marco' means when the words are translated into english, but what\nit means in a more general sense.\n\nMicrosoft introduced its 'smart tags' to howls of protest not about the\nfunctionality, but about the limited range of destinations the links pointed\nto. Having a framework that allows anybody to offer a link, and the user to\nchoose which offers they are interested in, may reduce the unease some people\nhave about what is in some ways a valuable functionality.\n\nI once had a job electronically archiving stories on behalf of an aboriginal\ncommunity. They had a complex set of use cases, including needing to be able\nto look up any word in a dictionary and find out what it was in another\nlanguage (the originals were in a group of 31 cognate languages) and whether\na particular word might be Taboo (this applied most often to names) under\ncertain circumstances. Without being able to satisfy these use cases they\nwere not prepared to make the stories available to the wider community even\nat the risk of seeing them lost forever.\n\nVoice services pitch themselves on the basis of (among other things) speech\nquality. With a name like mine I would dearly love to be able to annotate it\nwith a good pronunciation algorithm. As would the fictional Hyacinth Bucket\n(it's pronounced like bouquet in french - boo-kay in north eastern american\nenglish is close), although my friend Kevin Bucket wants to have the right\npronunciation for his name (it's pronounced like bucket). Set p one voiceXML\ndocument and let two service providers offer access to it, enhancing it as\nthey see fit...\n\nI believe there are a multitude of scenarios.

When someone prints/displays the document, they will presumably\nuse a font that is appropriate for them (or for their target audience). Your\nmother wouldn't use an Urdu font to print a document; she wouldn't see Urdu\nglyphs for the numbers.\n\n(b) If you want the precise shape, no matter what the target environment,\nthen you would embed an image in the document. That way you are insulated\nfrom the vagaries of the user's environment (but are locked into a fixed\nshape).\n\nApproach (a) is a bit like just-in-time localization, where one transmits\nbinary numbers wherever possible. At the latest possible point, they are\nformated into whatever the user's locale conventions are.\n\nThere are intermediate points between these. For example, no matter what the\ntarget environment, I could want a glyph appropriate for Urdu, but I don't\ncare about the exact shape. Or I could want a glyph appropriate to a\nparticular font (Times New Roman), but not care about the precise shape,\nwhich may vary somewhat on different machines or resolutions. In either of\nthese latter two cases, I am dependent on the level of support offered on\nthe recipient machine; if Urdu or Times New Roman are not\ninstalled/available, then I will get some fallback anyway.\n\nMark\n________\nmark.davis@jtcsv.com\nIBM, MS 50-2/B11, 5600 Cottle Rd, SJ CA 95193\n(408) 256-3148\nfax: (408) 256-0799\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Roozbeh Pournader\" <roozbeh@sharif.edu>\nTo: \"Mark Davis\" <mark.davis@jtcsv.com>\nCc: \"Roberto Scano - IWA/HWG\" <rscano@iwa-italy.org>; <ishida@w3.org>;\n<w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org>; <public-i18n-geo@w3.org>; \"Al Gilman\"\n<asgilman@iamdigex.net>; <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org>\nSent: Friday, March 14, 2003 10:13\nSubject: Re: Re[2]: FW: acronym in title...\n\n\n> On Fri, 14 Mar 2003, Mark Davis wrote:\n>\n> > Good point, although you are safest in that case actually annotating\nwith\n> > the font, and not depending on the target system.\n>\n> That's not safe.

Is it a reasonable 50,000 foot\nsummary of the bidi algorithm without doing it an injustice and without\nsucking in the other 500 definitions and details?\nAfter you guys look at it, I'll send it to the ig list.\ntex\n\n\nSome languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew,  are written right-to-left. Often,\nthese languages also incorporate text that is written left-to-right so they\nare known as bidirectional. Before creating documents that include\nright-to-left text you will want to consider the following:\n\n1) Right-to-left readers scan and process documents differently from\nleft-to-right readers. Therefore, graphics, forms and overall document layout,\nwhich have been designed for LTR readers, will typically need to be modified\nto be correctly understood and usable by  RTL readers. Based on the preferred\nreading direction of your target audience and your content, you should decide\nwhether the entire document should have a RTL direction, or just certain\nsections or spans of text. This decision will then help you decide the\ndocument layout and whether any graphics, forms, or sections of the document\nneed modifications for RTL readers. It may be helpful, when mixing sizable\nportions of both LTR and RTL text to section the document into \"bands\" of\ntext, where each band is primarily of one directionality.\n\n2) What does it mean to set direction?\nSetting direction establishes the initial state of text flow. This setting\naffects text rendering and in particular determines: 1) layout of block\nelements, 2) the relative positioning of runs of text, where direction changes\nfrom run to run, and 3) the placement of certain Unicode characters. Note that\ntext alignment is separate from direction and must be set independently in\nHTML.\n\nLayout\nAt the highest levels of rendering a page, the flow direction establishes\nwhether table and block elements are filled in from the right or the left.\n\nText runs\nText is rendered using the Unicode bidirectional algorithm. The algorithm\nprocesses text paragraph by paragraph. Within each paragraph, text is\nsegmented into runs with the same direction. The state of direction is\nestablished by character properties or by specific Unicode characters that\nexplicitly set direction. Proceeding within a paragraph from run to run, each\ndirection change establishes an additional \"direction embedding level\". The\ntext runs are positioned relative to each other by the algorithm. Changing the\ninitial state of text flow can change the position of the runs.\n\nNeutral Unicode Characters\nUnicode characters have a direction property. Most spacing characters have the\nproperty of either \"Strong LTR\" or \"Strong RTL\" direction. Non-spacing\ncharacters follow the direction of their base character. The bidirectional\nalgorithm renders these characters  according to their directionality. The\nmajority of Unicode characters have a strong direction and therefore are\nrendered based on their property value. Other characters have weak or neutral\nproperty values. Weak characters are rendered according to their proximity to\ncharacters with \"strong\" directionality. Neutral characters are rendered by\neither their proximity to characters with \"strong\" directionality  or the\ncurrent embedding level's direction. If the initial state of text flow is\naltered, the position of neutral characters may be affected.\n\ntex\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "On a related issue, I have long felt that the \"backwards compatibility\"\naspects of HTML are ugly. Because the policy is that browsers skip what they\ndon't know, it doesn't allow for richer text within elements, and we just\nget hacks like \"alt\", that cannot contain marked up text.\n\nIdeally, we'd be able to mark elements which -- with their contents --\nshould be skipped if the browser doesn't know what they mean, and be able to\ninclude elements that substitute for unknown elements. To do that, one would\nhave to have attributes that would be scanned for, even if the element is\nnot known. An example would be something like:\n\n<p>This is <foobar skipIfUnknown=\"true\">blah blah\n<moreStuff>blah</moreStuff>blah</foobar><fallback element=\"foobar\"><span\nxml:lang=\"en\">If <i>blah</i> is not available, blah</span></fallback>\n\nIf the browser understood \"foobar\", it would do something with the contents:\n\n   blah blah <moreStuff>blah</moreStuff>blah\n\nand ignore\n\n  <span xml:lang=\"en\">If <i>blah</i> is not available, blah</span>\n\nIf it didn't understand \"foobar\", it would do the reverse.\n\nOf course, it is probably too late for this kind of approach now, but it\nwould have made things much easier.\n\nMark\n(????????????)\n________\nmark.davis@jtcsv.com\nIBM, MS 50-2/B11, 5600 Cottle Rd, SJ CA 95193\n(408) 256-3148\nfax: (408) 256-0799\n\n\n\n"

For instance:\n\n- How do I specify the encoding of an HTML, XHTML, XML or CSS document?\n- Which encoding declaration takes precedence for an HTML page, server\nor client?\n- Where can I find the charset names?\n- How do I set up my server to serve the right encoding for a page?\n- Can I encode XML and X/HTML in non-Unicode encodings, if the document\ncharacter set is Unicode?\n- How much support exists today for HTML written in Unicode?\n- If I use a Unicode encoding for a page, is UTF-8 or UTF-16 best?\n- How do I handle characters that are not supported by the encoding used\nby my page?\n\nFurther, it occurs to me that someone writing a question about encodings\ncould/should probably try to answer several if not all of these\nquestions at the same time.\n\nThoughts,\n\nRI\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ntel: +44 1753 480 292\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\n\n\n"

The HTML <select> function has no such capabilities.  It will list the <options> in the order received.  Thus one must manually pre-sort their translated options before presenting them to the client.\n\nFor example, lets say we have a pull-down list for types of pets.

It lists the <options> in the order received.  Thus one must pre-sort their translated options before presenting them to the client.

This is the Web!\n   Let's use it the way it was intended. Just put the links\n   in the main text.\n\n- I would mention the usefulness of this for education/teaching.\n   It's very widely used in Japan at least, in books on XML, and so on.\n\n- Giving an example is also a good idea, just to add some color.\n\n- It would be good to say something about the fact that tag names\n   in XHTML have to be lower case.\n\n- Mention that using non-ASCII tag names introduces stronger limitations\n   on what encodings you can use, because NCRs are not allowed in tag names.\n\n- I would de-emphasize the \"don't have the right fonts and\n   rendering software on your system\". This is a general problem.\n   We also should say that processing software should not have any\n   problems whatsoever with tags outside ASCII; if it does,\n   it's simply not XML.\n\n- \"If you yourself had to deal with a tagset in, say, Chinese\": We\n   should be careful with the wording. It may lead some people to\n   think that XML is mainly for the authors, while it is intended\n   to be distributed widely.\n\n>-       http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-encoding-alts.html\n>(not quite completed)\n\nI would stay away from this subject for a little more time.\nIt's very difficult to get this short, complete, easy, simple,\nand correct. There is also quite some material out there (including\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/O-charset.html and\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset), and\nsome points are under discussion. So I would wait with this\nor maybe try with more limited question(s) first.\n\n\nYou separately mentioned\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-space.html\n\nI think the \"If you are using certain browsers this may be because\"\nis very dangerous. This brings us back to the old, dark days of\ntrying to second-guess browser implementations. It may be necessary\nin some cases, but not without any indication of what is the\ncorrect browser behavior.\n\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n\n"

Hmmm, yes, the spec seems to say that.  Your mileage may vary \nthough, especially with U+0000 NULL.  If I put &#x0000; in an HTML file, \nIE6 displays it as \"&#x0000;\", litterally.  It doesn't interpret it as \nan NCR.  Other NCRs in the C0 and C1 ranges variously give a \nmissing-glyph rectangle or nothing at all.  &#x0080; yields a euro sign!\n\n>     * XML 1.0 and XHTML do not allow these characters.\n\nThe C1 range is allowed in XML 1.0.\n\n>     * XML 1.1 allows the characters to be represented by Numeric\n>       Character References (NCR) or Character Entity References.\n\nThere are no such things as Character Entity References in XML.  The \ncontrols are allowed *only* as NCRs.\n\n\n>       Solutions\n> \n> If you need to represent these characters in XML 1.0 or XHTML, you can \n> create a convention to represent them and replace every occurence with \n> that convention. An alternative is to encode the data. For example, \n> encode the data as base64 or as hexadecimal values, to ensure only \n> supported characters are used in the markup language text. (And of \n> course, decoding the text when reading the files.) Note that XML Schema \n> provides data types for these encodings.\n> \n> Another alternative is to store the data in an external document and \n> reference it from the XML document.\n> \n> In XML 1.1, the simplest alternative is to represent any occurence of a \n> C0 character with an NCR. For example, the character \"ESCAPE\" U+001B \n> would be represented by either &#x1B; (hexadecimal) or &#27; (decimal).\n\nDoesn't work for U+0000 NULL.\n\n> \n> \n>       Additional Details\n> \n> The HTML 4 specification, Section 5.1 The Document Character Set \n> <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.1>, simply declares \n> that HTML supports ISO 10646 and its first 5 amendments \n> <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/references.html#ref-ISO10646>.

            "content": "Fran?ois,\n\nthanks as always.\nMostly agreement here and some new understanding on my part. I numbered your\ncomments in the text and just reply here:\n\n1) control code characters - I think of it as characters that represent\ncontrol codes, so don't really see a problem.\nI'll look at this, after we deal with the more substantial comments. I do see\nyour point though in codes not being characters.\n\n2) Originally, I really did just mean to discuss just c0... Actually c0\nwithout null, since I didn't think there was an issue with null, but you\nundermined all of this... ;-(  I'll come back to the scope after we review the\nrest of your points.\n\n3) NULL- ok, what to say about it? I don't want to doc browsers' random\nbehavior. It would be nice to say its illegal and be done with it.\n\n4) I do know that IE maps the c1 range into 1252 values. It encourages people\nto presume that those values represent legit characters rather than forcing\nthem to use correct NCRs. On the other hand, I am sure it is a compatibility\nissue for many many pages. If we discuss c1, I can add this as a caution.\n\n5) C0 in html- the spec says yes. I agree there are no glyphs, when I tried\nit, although &#2; was a different box than &#x3;-&#x8; for some reason.\nHowever, the validator rejects these characters. I want to get Martin's\ncomment on why dtd makes it unused.\n\n6) c1 is allowed in XML. Yes I agree. That is why I restricted myself to c0. I\ndidn't see an issue. Since it is supported, legacy apps don't have a problem\nmigrating to *ML and using it. However, I now understand it is restricted in\n1.1, so needs to be covered.\n\n7) character entity references. Maybe this is a terminology problem on my\npart.\nThe title of http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec4.1 is character\nand entity references.\nI presumed the former was ncr and the latter was CER. It is possible to give a\nname to a character in xml.\nIs that not called a CER? I guess HTML uses CER for the predefined ones. I\nrealize XML doesn't have these definitions predefined.\nShall I just call it an entity reference?\n\n8) NCR doesn't work for null. ok, I'll doc this.\n\n9) AHA! ok. I see the production changed in\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec2.2\nso that 7f-9f except 85 is excluded. Seems to me an odd thing to do, although\nI appreciate there is a lot of ambiguity around controls.\n\n\nok, thanks very much for your careful review! \n\nWhat I thought was going to be a cheap, easy one paragraph Q&A has become a\nmuch larger effort... oh well. Too bad it is in such a marginal area, although\nI know a couple programmers that were having trouble with this...\n\ntex\n\n\nFran?ois Yergeau wrote:\n> \n> Comments embedded below.\n> \n> Tex Texin a ?crit:\n> >   Questions & Answers: HTML, XHTML, XML and control code characters\n> \n\n1\n> \"control code characters\" looks wrong to me.

I want to get Martin's\n> comment on why dtd makes it unused.\n\nOK, let's dive.  Looking more closely, the spec doesn't really say yes. \n  Section 5.1 obliquely says that the document character set is \nISO10646.   And 10646 in turn doesn't define the C0 and C1 controls it \njust says (Clause 15): \"This coded character set provides for use of \ncontrol functions encoded according to ISO/IEC 6429 or similarly \nstructured standards for control functions, and standards derived from \nthese.\"  And if you look at the code charts, the C0 and C1 areas are \nconspicuously empty (grayed out).\n\nThe HTML spec contains an SGML declaration (section 20.1) which formally \ndeclares what the document character set is:\n\n     CHARSET\n           BASESET  \"ISO Registration Number 177//CHARSET\n                     ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993 UCS-4 with\n                     implementation level 3//ESC 2/5 2/15 4/6\"\n          DESCSET 0       9       UNUSED\n                  9       2       9\n                  11      2       UNUSED\n                  13      1       13\n                  14      18      UNUSED\n                  32      95      32\n                  127     1       UNUSED\n                  128     32      UNUSED\n                  160     55136   160\n                  55296   2048    UNUSED  -- SURROGATES --\n                  57344   1056768 57344\n\nSo it explicitly excludes all of C0, C1 and #x7F, except for TAB, CR and \nLF.

Maybe this is a terminology problem on my\n> part.\n\nWell, HTML does have this terminology (in 5.3.2).  It's not defined \nclearly, but it seems to cover all the predefined entities that HTML \noffers \"to give authors a more intuitive way of referring to characters \nin the document character set\".  The purported intuitiveness is, of \ncourse, lost on non-English-speakers.\n\n> The title of http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec4.1 is character\n> and entity references.\n> I presumed the former was ncr and the latter was CER.

I didn't try xhtml, but for an html example,\nI see several of the characters in the 0x80-90 range in both IE and NS7.\nPerhaps the stricter parsing corrects the other characters, but it is odd the\neuro shows thru then.\n\n5) Unicode 3, section 13.1 says more or less it is up to the application but\nfalls back to 6429.

If a native Japanese speaker is reading an  \nEnglish web\npage from a web site in Germany that contains the date 03/04/02 how  \nwill they\nreact?\n\nIn such cases, it is important to use an unambiguous format.  Using ISO\n\n8601 is\none approach.  2003-04-02 is somewhat clearer than 03/04/02.  Using an\nabbreviation for the month makes it even more clear:  2003-Apr-02.\n\nFor dynamically generated web pages you can use the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE\nheader to control which date format is used.  A  \nfull\ndiscussion of how to do this would be too large for this document, but  \nhere are\npointers for some common environments.\n\nJava/JSP:  Call the getLocale method of the ServletRequest or\nHttpServletRequest object.  Use the returned Locale object to call  \nDateFormat.\n\nASP: Use Request.ServerVariables(\"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE\") to get the\nusers preferences.  Parse the first locale from the list of accepted  \nlocales.  You'll\nhave to do your own mapping from the alphabetic locale code to a numeric\nLocale Identifier.  Set Session.LCID to the resulting value.  Call  \nFormatDateTime\nto format the date.\n\nPerl: Use $ENV{'HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'} to get the preferred language.\nUse POSIX:strftime to format date values.  You'll have to do your own  \nmapping\nof the accepted langauges value to a date format string.\n\n\nRemember, even if you use one of these methods for formatting the date,\nchoose an unambiguous  date format to avoid the sort of problems  \nmentioned\nabove.

I have a\nJapanese system with lots of English applications.

Using an\n>abbreviation for the month makes it even more clear:  2003-Apr-02.\n\nWhy not just write \"April 2nd, 2003\"? That's much more readable. Also,\nassuming it is an US site, it is easiest to parse for US readers,\nwho are probably the main target, while still unambiguous for others.\n\nMaybe we have to distinguish between dates in text and dates in\ntables (for the later, space considerations may be important).\nBut then again, there are many cases in between.\n\n\n>For dynamically generated web pages you can use the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE\n>header\n\nThe HTTP header is \"Accept-Language\". \"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE\" is the\nvariable name that is used in CGI scripts to reflect that header.\n\n\n>to control which date format is used.\n\nThis may be read as saying that if you get Accept-Language: en-us,\nthen using 04/02/03 is okay. I would have to disagree with this;\nI think building in a bit of redundancy is important because too\nmany things can go wrong (browser settings, fallbacks,...).\nWe should make clear that redundancy is always desirable.\n\n\n>A\n>full\n>discussion of how to do this would be too large for this document, but\n>here are\n>pointers for some common environments.\n>\n>Java/JSP:  Call the getLocale method of the ServletRequest or\n>HttpServletRequest object.

It not only\nanswers 'How do ... support control codes', but also 'what are\ncontrol codes', and so on. But the question assumes a basic\nknowledge of control codes. Peolpe who don't know these\nare not even interested in reading the answer.\n\nAlso, I guess the real question is not how HTML and XML\nsupport control codes, but \"How can I represent control\ncodes in HTML or XML\".\n\nThe basic message also should be improved. (X)HTML is a\ntextual format used to represent text. There is absolutely\nno need to use control codes in (X)HTML. If anybody thinks\notherwise, they didn't understand (X)HTML. I don't remember\nhaving been asked about control codes in (X)HTML at all.\nThis should be clearly reflected in the answer.\n\nXML in general is used both for text and for data. So\nthere may be some interesting use cases for control\ncodes in XML. The typical example would be an XML\nformat for control code sequences for terminals\n(i.e. an XML version of a unix termcap file).\n\nApart from such rather exotic examples, the main reason\nthat there are control codes in data usually is one of\nthe following (most probably in the following order):\n\n- Pure garbage. The right thing is to clean up your data.\n\n- Old ways of representing data (starting with using Backspace\n   to get accented versions of characters).

            "content": "Hi, Good comments, although I have some disagreements, I liked your analysis\nand think the points worth discussing.\n\n0) Question wording. Yes, we agreed to change the wording to something close\nto what you suggested.\n\n1) Length. I think people may have a general idea of what controls are but may\nnot know the specifics, and especially the specifics of the ranges and the\nranges in Unicode. We could break the piece into multiple questions, but I\nwonder about how appropriate these backgrounders are for an i18n qa list...\nEspecially this early on. We could move more of the background explanation\nbelow the question and answer. I think you are right the question and answer\nshould be succint, and at the top of the page but I don't see a problem with\nadditional clarifying and supporting information being available on the page,\nafter the main point is discussed.\n\nIf there is a strong objection to the background info, I would be happy to\nmove it to a page on my web site, GEO can have the short version and GEO can\noptionally link to my page for more info.\n\n2) Relevance- I understand your questioning the topic, I would have done the\nsame. It came about because in fact I was asked the question last week.\nControls are not only used for manipulating devices. They have other uses.\nAn application development environment I am familiar with does a lot of\nvalue-list processing. Depending on the nature of the data, the list separator\nis changed. e.g. if it's a list of european decimals they would not want\ncommas as a separator. To avoid conflicts between the list values and\nseparators, in general routines, they use 0x01, 0x02, etc. as separators. So\nthey have lots of data in databases using these values.\n(Yes, they could have instead adopted escape mechanisms instead.)\n\nThey ran into problems writing the data to xml. Some software liked it, others\ndidn't. When they looked into the errors due to control codes not being\nallowed they needed advice. Which are the disallowed characters, and what are\nthe workarounds? Hence the article.\nI believe there may be a lot of data using controls, and as with this group,\npeople may not have time to develop better solutions other than writing the\ndata out as NCRs.\n\n3) So because of 2, I claim if XML is for data interchange, support for\ninterchange of controls is needed. I can agree the needs are exotic.\nYou can argue that the data should instead be cleaned up, but that is\nimpractical in some cases.\nIn any event, it is worthwhile to let people know what is and is not doable in\n*ML.\nI don't mind giving more emphasis to cleaning up the data.\nI also don't mind emphasizing that control codes are to be avoided, and are\nbad for scalability and on the web.\nI would disagree with saying never use controls in XML.\nI would presume the reason support for controls as NCRs was added, is because\nsome needs were identified for supporting controls.\n\n\n4) separate rows for NL. I agree.\n\n5) encoding. I believe what we said, is that if the data is in fact binary,\nencoding is an option.\nEssentially, if it is binary, it is not an i18n issue.\n\nRichard, if you want to finish the changes you were going to make, you can\naddress Martin's comments or pass it back to me and I'll address them.\ntex\n\n\nMartin Duerst wrote:\n> \n> Hello Tex,\n> \n> Some more comments on your Q&A.\n> \n> Overall, I think that the answer is much too long.

The \"warning\"\nsection sounds like the one for a non-Unicode application that supports only\ncurrent Windows Locale settings...\nI will try it with a Japanese Locale. But as far as I know, with an en_US\nLocale, I can only open and save Latin chars...\n\n/Fran?ois\n\n[...]\nOverview:\nTextPad automatically detects 16-bit Unicode and UTF-8 encoded characters,\nwhen opening files. Unicode characters may be in \"little endian\" (Intel) or\n\"big endian\" (RISC) order, and the order is preserved when a file is saved.\n\nInternally, these files are converted to single or double byte characters\n(DBCS), using the locale corresponding to the font script selected for the\ndocument class. For example, if the screen font for the Text document class\nis MS Mincho, with the script set to Japanese, Unicode characters in *.TXT\nfiles will be converted to the corresponding DBCS characters in code page\n932.\n\nWARNING: This means that it is only possible to edit, without data loss,\nfiles containing characters from the implied code page.

This combination of characters is known a Byte Order Mark (BOM). Some applications - such as a text editor or a browser - will interpret the BOM as an extra line in the file and will render it accordingly, others will display ???.\n \nThe BOM is the encoded Unicode Scalar Value (unique reference to a character defined within the Unicode repertoire), U+FEFF, corresponding to the Unicode character 'Zero Width Non-Breaking Space' (ZWNBSP), whose sequence of byte-values is judged to be unlikely to occur at the beginning of any 'normal' text file. Additionally, using U+FEFF for its 'original' purpose as a word joiner in new data is deprecated as of [Unicode3.2] in favour of U+2060 WORD JOINER. Therefore newer documents will only use U+FEFF as a BOM.\n \nIn UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, the BOM is essential to ensure correct interpretation of the file's contents, because each character in the file is composed of pairs of bytes of data.  Also, the order in which these bytes are stored in the file is significant; the BOM indicates this order.\n \nIn UTF-8 encodings, the presence of the BOM is not essential because, unlike the UTF-16 or UTF-32 encodings, each byte of the data contained in a UTF-8 file is 'atomic'. This means it contains meta data which indicates whether it represents a whole character in itself, or whether it needs to be combined with a number (1-3) of further bytes to derive an encoded character.\n \n \nANSWER \n \nThe HTTP header charset declaration, or HTML charset declaration (in the absence of the HTTP header charset declaration, which takes precedence), should normally be used to indicate the encoding. Therefore, if your UTF-8 encoded web page displays an  unwanted blank line at the top, and you have an editor capable of displaying the Unicode BOM as described above, you should remove from the beginning of the file the three characters displayed as ???.\n \nAlternatively, if you have a binary editor capable of displaying the hexadecimal byte values in the file, you should remove the three bytes at the beginning of the file whose values are displayed as EF BB BF.\n \nAlternatively, you can use a Perl script to remove the characters.

            "subject": "Re: Opening files in Notepad with/without UTF8 signatur",
            "content": "Richard,\n\nThe issue is that the FAQ simply recommends removing the BOM as a solution and\noffers no indication of possible consequences. We just need to indicate that\nremoving the BOM can have some impact.\n\nIn terms of what that impact may be, it depends on how the file is used. We can\nlook at risks to notepad users, but the file might be touched by many other\napplications, any of which might have a dependency on the BOM as a signature.\n\nWith respect to Notepad, one of the considerations we discussed is that Windows\nhas 3 file systems. One of them, NTFS, maintains additional information about\nfiles. We speculated it recorded encoding. So, if notepad made use of that, the\nBOM might be less necessary in that environment. (Which I suspect is also your\nenvironment, as NTFS is the default for hard disks.)  \n\nHowever, it won't have that information on other file systems. I think one test\nis to open a file on a floppy, which won't be ntfs.\nAlso notepad has some awareness of html format and perhaps other markup\nfiletypes, so to test this, we need to make sure of these dependencies. e.g. I\nam sure all your files have a meta charset statement. But others may not.\n\nAlso, you and I can remove BOMS on our systems, our files aren't being\nprocessed by complex development or complicated web publishing systems.\nHowever, files that are in such an environment such as Deborah might have,\ncould easily have some dependency on bom detection.\n\nBut the point is that the few tests we made today are not going to cover all\nthe possible scenarios where removing a BOM can have an impact.\n\nAs for concerns, they are two-fold.\n\na) In an environment where people are blissfully letting notepad and other\nsoftware use the BOM as an indicator, if one individual reads the faq, starts\nremoving BOMs, and he/she and others are unaware of the consequences, they\ndon't know to start paying attention to encoding when they open the file. So\nit's nice that it is shown on the open dialog, but nobody will pay attention to\nit until after a problem occurs. And if they use right-click, they won't even\nget the choice.\n\nb) The danger is that a file is opened as iso 8859-1 for example, and as markup\nis mostly ascii, it is possible for the encoding problem not to be noticed, and\nthen if the file is saved as utf-8, the non-ascii data will be corrupt.\n(Latin-1 characters written out instead of Unicode, as utf-8)\n\nSaving it as utf-8 might require some overt user action, but is not beyond\nbelief. Another scenario is the user copies and pastes data from the iso file\nto another correctly utf-8 file, but the data pasted will now be incorrect.\n\nThe solution to the FAQ is just to include a sentence or two indicating that if\nyou are going to remove a BOM, you should know how the file is used and verify\nwhether it will have an impact, (or remove it and monitor that subsequent\nprocessing doesn't break).\n\nAlso, as we noted, BOM is not the only reason there might be problem lines or\ncharacters in front of  files.\ne.g. misinterpretation of the encoding, perhaps an older or incorrect version\nof the software.\n\nAnd an alternative solution is to upgrade or replace software to make it BOM\naware.\n\n(Although that doesn't work for CSS yet.)\n\nhth\ntex\n\n\n\n\n\nRichard Ishida wrote:\n> \n> Tex,\n> \n> I have realised this evening that although I use Notepad all the time, I\n> almost never used the Open dialog box !

I did experiment with both my and your\nscripts under UTF-8 locale and C/POSIX locale, but a subtle bug with\n's//' in Perl 5.8.0  led me to the incorrect conclusion.\n\n> It would very much surprise me if there were no way to say\n> inside a perl program that input and output should be treated\n> as binary.\n\nPhew, it turned out that it's quite complicated.  'use bytes' and\n'binmode' are supposed to do the trick, but somehow I couldn't\nmake it work in Perl 5.8.0\n\nAnyway, I knew there was a change made between 5.8 and 5.8.1,\nbut it was different from what I thought it had been.  See\n\nhttp://dev.perl.org/perl5/news/2003/perl-5.8.1.html#Core_Enhancements\n\nfor details.  In short, unless you explicitly ask for 'UTF-8 file I/O',\nPerl 5.8.1 (or later) does not use it.\n\nYour script should work except when Perl 5.8 is run\nunder UTF-8-based locale and when Perl 5.8.1 is run with PERL_UNICODE\nenvironment variable is defined.\n\nThe most version-independent/locale-independent recipe (on Unix) is to use\nthe following 'one liner' ('\\' is for the line continuation so that it can\nbe removed if you type it in a single line. Most people on this\nlist may be aware of that, but this is for FAQ....)\n\nprompt> env LC_ALL=C PERL_UNICODE= \\\n        perl -pi~ -0777 -e \"s/^\\xEF\\xBB\\xBF//s;\" filename.html\n\nLC_ALL=C is necessary because the majority of Linux distributions still\nhave Perl 5.8.0 and many Linux users nowadays use  UTF-8-based\nlocales.\n\n\n>> Even in\n>> earlier Perl, it has a problem of removing U+FEFF at places other than\n>> the very beginning of files.\n>\n>\n> No, that's what the -0777 option is for, which makes the\n> whole file being treated as a single line.\n\n   Sorry I didn't know that. That's nice to know. I gave a brief thought\nto changing the line delimeter inside a script (to get the same effect\nas -0777), but it seemed to me that it's simpler to just use '$. == 1'\ncondition. However, for sure, '-0777' is handy.\n\n   Jungshik\n\n\n\n"

Unless a file contains two or more characters \nof UTF-8 sequences, it must start with the Unicode signature, to be \ncorrectly recognised.\n\nIf there is 32kb of text before any UTF-8 sequences, then the file \nwill not be recognized as UTF-8.\n\nWe will enhance a future version of TextPad to recognise the XML \nheader \"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\".\n\nPlease also see the information on working with Unicode files, which is\navailable \nfrom the Help menu as follows:\n \n>From the Help menu choose:\n \n1. Help Topics\n2. Contents\n3. Plus sign next to \"How to\"\n4. Plus sign next to \"Work with Files\"\n5.

            "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'd like to submit the following as an FAQ on global gateways. It is quite\nlong (perhaps too long) and needs a bit of work yet - please send me your\ncomments.\n\nI'd also like this to be a starting point for discussing best practices in\nglobal navigation - something that we can incorporate into the \"Authoring\nTechniques\" section on navigation.\n\nThanks...\n\n================================\n\nGlobal Gateway FAQ\n\nQUESTION\nMy company has developed a number of country-specific Web sites. How do I\nensure that visitors to our global ?.com? home page find their\ncountry-specific sites?\n\nANSWER\nYou need to develop a ?global gateway? strategy. A global gateway is an\numbrella term for the visual and technical devices you employ to direct\nusers to their locale- and language-specific Web sites.\n\nA global gateway may employ one or all of the following devices:\n\n1.Localized URL (country- and/or language-specific)\n2.Content Negotiation\n3.Splash Gateway\n4.Permanent Gateway\n\nIdeally, the elements are used in concert to ensure that Web users find the\nsites they need as quickly and seamlessly as possible. Here is an overview\nof each device:\n\nLocalized URL\n\nThe URL is the most direct path to a localized Web site. At a minimum, if\nyou have a country-specific Web site, you should register for a\ncountry-specific domain, such as www.foo.fr for France or www.foo.br for\nBrazil. Country-specific domains also help your site perform better in local\nsearch engines.\n\nCompanies may also register domain names in non-Latin scripts (sometimes\nreferred to as internationalized domain names). For example, a company in\nKorea, Netpia (www.netpia.com) offers support for Korean-language domain\nnames. However, be aware that the DNS currently only supports a subset of\nthe ASCII character set; all non-Latin workarounds are just that,\nworkarounds. Keep an eye on ICANN (http://icann.org) for developments on\ninternationalized domain names.\n\nContent Negotiation\n\nA Web browser, by default, will tell a Web server what language it prefers\nwhen it requests a Web page. If a Web server has multiple language versions\nof the same Web page, it may be configured to respond with the matching\nlanguage; this process is referred to as content negotiation or language\nnegotiation and is invisible to the Web user.\n\nGoogle (www.google.com) relies on content negotiation. To test it out, using\nInternet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet Options > Languages and set a\ndifferent language preference. The language at the top of the list is the\none you want delivered to you first. Using Netscape Navigator, you select\nEdit > Preferences > Navigator > Languages.\n\n(Iinclude screen shots of both browsers preference screens)\n\nAfter configuring your preference, exit your browser. Open it back up and\nvisit Google. The home page should not match your first preference, unless\nyou picked a language Google does not support (Google supports more than 60\nso far).\n\nThe downside to content negotiation is that many Web users do not know how\nto re-configure their browsers should they wish to change their language\npreference; this can be frustrating for multilingual Web users or people who\nshare a computer.\n\nSplash Gateway\n\nA splash gateway forces the user to select his or her locale before entering\nthe main page of the site. The benefit of a splash gateway is that ensures\nthat visitors know what locales are available to them; the liabilities of\nthis approach is that it draws attention to the fact that a company many not\noffer many locales.\n\nSplash gateways can also be annoying to repeat visitors. Therefore, if you\nuse a splash gateway, you should also rely on cookies to save the user?s\nlanguage preference so that the splash page is bypassed on return visits.\neTrade (www.etrade.com) uses a splash gateway and cookies.\n\n(Screen shot of eTrade splash page)\n\nPermanent gateway\n\nIf can only use just one global gateway element, this is the one to use. The\npermanent gateway should be clearly visible on every Web page, ideally\nlocated on the upper right-hand corner of the page (most gateways are\nlocated in this area). A permanent gateway is critical because not all users\narrive at your site through the ?front door.?\n\nThere is an art to designing a gateway ? balancing creativity with\nusability. A globe icon is becoming a default icon for indicating a global\ngateway.\n\nIf your site has four or fewer locale selections, it makes sense to place\ndirect links to each of these sites as shown here.\n\n(Screen shot example)\n\nIf your site has more than four locales, you may need to use a pull-down\nmenu.\n\n(Screen shot example)\n\n\nBY THE WAY\n\nTranslate the links\nDon?t forget to translate the names of the languages in the gateway. For\nexample, don?t use ?German? when you can use ?Deutsch.?  Always use the\nnative language of your user.\n\nAvoid flag waving\nUnless you offer a site specific to most countries, flags can be\ntroublesome. For example, what flag do you use to represent a region or a\nlanguage?\n\n\nADDITIONAL LINKS\n\nICANN\n\nOther links?\n\n\n\n================================\nJohn Yunker\njyunker@bytelevel.com\nByte Level Research\n\n\n\n"

It requires a\nplugin that works only with MS IE on Windows and your name server has\nto be modified to support it. Besides, it's not domain names per se\nbut 'keyword' service.\n\n> However, be aware that the DNS currently only supports a subset of\n> the ASCII character set; all non-Latin workarounds are just that,\n> workarounds. Keep an eye on ICANN (http://icann.org) for developments on\n> internationalized domain names.\n\n  I'm afraid this is a bit misleading. It's true that only a subset of\nASCII chars can be used, but that has already been worked around with\na specially-devised encoding scheme (to wrap up Unicode characters\nin that subset of ASCII) as you probably know.\n\n A few months ago the KR domain registrar began to accept\n_genuine_ internationalized domain registration in Korean for .kr\ndomain. IDN works NOW with Mozilla and Opera. MS IE and Konqueror/Safari\ndon't yet support it though. Try 'http://%ec%a0%95%ed%86%b5%eb%b6%80.kr' for instance.\nI guess the same is true of other national domains.\n\n\n> Content Negotiation\n\n> Google (www.google.com) relies on content negotiation.

The language at the top of the list is the\n> one you want delivered to you first. Using Netscape Navigator, you select\n> Edit > Preferences > Navigator > Languages.\n\n  Could you please mention Mozilla whenever you mention Netscape?\nAs I wrote earlier in another thread, Netscape is a Netscape-branded\nbrowser based on Mozilla and with the shutdown of Netscape division of\nTime-Warner, there is likely to be any new version of Netscape. However,\nMozilla will continue to be developed.\n\n> The downside to content negotiation is that many Web users do not know how\n> to re-configure their browsers should they wish to change their language\n> preference; this can be frustrating for multilingual Web users or people who\n> share a computer.\n\n  It'd be frustrating if you're an American at a net-cafe in one of\nnon-English speaking countries and you don't know how to set up your\nlanguage preference.\n\n  Would it be a good idea to include a link to the Apache reference\ndocument on language setting of documents served and document on other\nweb servers?  In the default Apache installation, it's very easy to\noffer multiple versions of _static_ documents. Just use language codes\nas suffices (e.g. index.ja.html or index.html.ja for Japanese). Apache\nwill pick up and serve index.fr.html   if the language preference of a\nclient is French.\n\n> BY THE WAY\n\n> Translate the links\n> Don???t forget to translate the names of the languages in the gateway.

(Han-guk-o)\ninstead of '??????'(Hangul). The former is the name of the language and\nthe latter is the name of the script. You wouldn't use 'Cyrillic alphabet'\nfor Russian, would you?\n\n  Jungshik\n\n\n\n"

Note that a number of more recent browsers, such as the latest Windows-based versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla (Netscape) and Opera, do not exhibit this behaviour.\n\nYou may not be able to see the cause of the extra line or space in your editor, if it interprets UTF-8 correctly. An editor which does not interpret UTF-8 correctly, displays the UTF-8 signature according to its own character encoding setting. With the Latin 1 ISO 8859-1 character encoding, the signature displays as extraneous characters ???. With a binary editor capable of displaying the hexadecimal byte values in the file, the UTF-8 signature displays as EF BB BF. \n\nTo remove the extra line or spaces that appear in the browser, remove the extraneous characters, which represent the UTF-8 signature. You can remove them manually or with a script. One of the benefits of using a script is that you can remove the extraneous characters from multiple files.\n\nYou should check thoroughly the result of removing the signature, bearing in mind that pages with a high proportion of Latin characters may look correct superficially, but that characters outside the ASCII compatibility range (U+0000 to U+007F) may be incorrectly encoded.\n\nIf there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file, then your problem lies elsewhere.\n\n\nBackground\n\nAn editor that does not correctly interpret Unicode (encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) recognises each byte as referring to one character (some editors may assume two-bytes per character); the character referred to by that byte value depends on the encoding assumed by the editor. An editor that does correctly interpret UTF-8 recognises that a character reference can require 1-4 bytes. In UTF-8 encoding, the number of bytes used to refer to a Unique Scalar Value in the Unicode repertoire is determined by the first byte.\n\nUnicode characterUTF-8 byte 1UTF-8 byte 2UTF-8 byte 3UTF-8 byte 4\n\n0000 to 007F (ASCII)01xxxxxx\n0080 to 07FF110xxxxx10xxxxxx\n0800 to FFFF1110xxxx10xxxxxx10xxxxxx\n10000 to 10FFFF11110xxx10xxxxxx10xxxxxx10xxxxxx\n\nAll Unicode characters encoded in UTF-8, which fall outside the ASCII compatibility range (0 to 127 decimal), have byte values greater than 127 decimal, which explains why they display as 'strange' characters in non-UTF-8 compliant editors and browsers.\n\nThe UTF-8 signature is also known as the Unicode UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM). UTF-8 is one encoding of the Unicode repertoire. Others include UTF-16 and UTF-32. All three encodings encode the same Unicode character repertoire, but they differ in the sequence of byte values which refer to that repertoire. \n\n- UTF-8 uses 1-4 bytes; the first byte of each encoded character determines how many subsequent bytes in the sequence are required.\n- UTF-16 uses 2 or 4 bytes; if more than two bytes are required, then the first two bytes refer to a reserved value in the Unicode repertoire, which indicate that the next two bytes should be used to obtain the final value.\n- UTF-32 always uses four bytes.\n\nAll three Unicode encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) can use the signature or BOM (Byte Order Mark). Whilst with UTF-8, the BOM serves one purpose as a 'signature' of Unicode, for UTF-16 and UTF-32, the BOM has further purpose. That purpose is to indicate the order in which the bytes should be read. This order varies according to processor architecture, which can be 'big' or 'little' 'endian':\n\n- Macs - Motorola, PowerPC = big endian\n- PCs - Intel = little endian\n- UNIX - different processors, therefore big or little endian\n\nThere are other Unicode encodings which do not require the presence of the BOM; these are \"UTF-16LE\", \"UTF-16-BE\", \"UTF-32LE\" and \"UTF-32BE\".\n\nBy the way\nYou will find that Windows Notepad and Helios Textpad will automatically add a UTF-8 signature to any file you save as UTF-8.\n\nA UTF-8 signature at the beginning of a CSS file can sometimes cause the initial rules in the file to fail on certain user agents.\n\nCutting and pasting UTF-8 text between different applications can have unexpected results, even if both applications are nominally UTF-8 aware.\n\nUseful links\nUnicode FAQ about the Byte Order Mark: http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html\n\nMicrosoft documentation about the Byte Order Markhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/unicode_42jv.asp\n\nApache content negotiation documentation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html\n\n\n\nBBCi at http://www.bbc.co.uk/\n\nThis e-mail (and any attachments) is confidential and may contain\npersonal views which are not the views of the BBC unless specifically\nstated.\nIf you have received it in error, please delete it from your system. \nDo not use, copy or disclose the information in any way nor act in\nreliance on it and notify the sender immediately.

A global \n> gateway is an umbrella term for the visual and technical \n> devices you employ to direct users to their locale- and \n> language-specific Web sites.\n> \n> A global gateway may employ one or all of the following devices:\n> \n> 1.Localized URL (country- and/or language-specific)\n> 2.Content Negotiation\n> 3.Splash Gateway\n> 4.Permanent Gateway\n> \n> Ideally, the elements are used in concert to ensure that Web \n> users find the sites they need as quickly and seamlessly as \n> possible.\n\nVery good point !\n\n> Here is an overview of each device:\n> \n> Localized URL\n> \n> The URL is the most direct path to a localized Web site. At a \n> minimum, if you have a country-specific Web site, you should \n> register for a country-specific domain, such as www.foo.fr \n> for France or www.foo.br for Brazil. Country-specific domains \n> also help your site perform better in local search engines.\n\nFor example URIs we should say 'www.example.fr' etc.\n\n> \n> Companies may also register domain names in non-Latin scripts \n> (sometimes referred to as internationalized domain names). \n\nOr IDN.\n\n> For example, a company in Korea, Netpia (www.netpia.com) \n> offers support for Korean-language domain names. However, be \n> aware that the DNS currently only supports a subset of the \n> ASCII character set; all non-Latin workarounds are just that, \n> workarounds. Keep an eye on ICANN (http://icann.org) for \n> developments on internationalized domain names.\n\nThis is now out of date.  The IETF approved IDN in March this year.  It\nis defined in RFCs 3490, 3491, 3492 and 3454, and already works on\nMozilla 1.4 / Netscape 7.1 and Opera 7.2.  The domain name is actually\nstill registered using a subset of ASCII characters, called Punycode,\nbut browsers above can convert native script URIs to this form.  For an\nexcellent overview of this see Internationalized Domain Names, K. Momoi\nhttp://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/idn .  .jp and .cn already\nsupport IDN (In Beijing this week I spoke with the head of the .cn\ndomain name org.)  Note also that all other approaches to this are now\ndisallowed in IDN.\n\nThis is of course too much detail for the FAQ.  We should probably say\nhere that domain names in local script are supported in many domains,\neg. .jp and .cn, and give an example - I have one in Chinese.  I don't\nknow whether it's worth mentioning in this FAQ that it makes sense to\nregister an alternative ASCII version of the domain name too, for those\nwho can't, eg, type in Chinese characters.\n\n> \n> Content Negotiation\n> \n> A Web browser, by default, will tell a Web server what \n> language it prefers when it requests a Web page.

When I was in Budapest I got Google\nautomatically displaying in Hungarian, and on my home computer Google\ncomes up in Spanish.  I have neither of these languages in my list of\npreferred languages.  I think it may use IP addresses.\n\n>To \n> test it out, using Internet Explorer, go to Tools > Internet \n> Options > Languages and set a different language preference. \n> The language at the top of the list is the one you want \n> delivered to you first.

In my presentation in Beijing I said:\n-the user may have never checked the Accept-Language setting\n-user agent may send a request that specifies only a language and\nnot a region \n(a particular issue if trying to establish locale for information like\ndate formats)\n-people borrow machines from friends, they use them in internet\ncafes - in these cases the inferred locale may be inappropriate\n-always allow the user to select the appropriate language (and\nlocale) from whatever page they are looking at !\n\nI think we should make the last point clearly. \n\nThe example I used was http://www.w3.org//Press/1998/CSS2-REC \n\n\n> \n> Splash Gateway\n> \n> A splash gateway forces the user to select his or her locale \n> before entering the main page of the site.

Maybe a question for a separate FAQ?\n\nWe have gone through this on http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation.\nWe basically use Unicode order (by codepoint, with some tweaks\nto adapt it to the Unicode sorting algorithm). The result is\nordering by script, with Latin first and all the other\nscripts later. For our case, that seems to be good enough\n(at one point, we had the texts in the actual language, but\nsorted by code, which was rather weird).\n\nThe main concern I have with the current order is that\npeople from Asia may look for their language in Latin,\ndon't find it, and may give up too early, because on\na small screen, they may not even see that there are\nnon-Latin language labels.\n\nFor many cases, ordering may be influenced by the number\nof customers in that language, which may be differen for\neach company. Often, one also sees Latin labels alternating\nwith non-latin labels, which solves the above problem and\nis graphically nice.\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\nAt 10:18 03/11/18 +0100, RICHARD,FRANCOIS (HP-France,ex1) wrote:\n\n\n\n> >(Screen shot example)\n> >\n> >If your site has more than four locales, you may need to use a\n> >pull-down menu.\n> >\n> >(Screen shot example)\n> >\n> >\n> >BY THE WAY\n> >\n> >Translate the links\n> >Don't forget to translate the names of the languages in the\n> >gateway.

I dont think \"removing\" is\nneeded it is implied.\n\nPerhaps change:\n\nWhen I'm using a UTF-8 encoding, why does an extra line\nappear at the top of my web page in some user agents, and\nhow do I remove it?\n\nto\n\nWhy do utf-8 encoded pages show extra lines at the top?\n\n\n2) Suggested changes to answer section, para by para-\n\na) Perhaps Change-\n\nThis may be caused by the presence of a UTF-8 signature at\nthe beginning of the file that the user agent doesn't\nrecognize. Note that a number of more recent browsers, such\nas the latest Windows-based versions of Internet Explorer,\nMozilla (Netscape) and Opera, do not exhibit this\nbehaviour.\n\nto:\n\nSome user agents do not (yet) treat the UTF-8 signature at\nthe beginning of the file properly.\nMany of the more recent browsers, such as the latest\nWindows-based versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla\n(Netscape) and Opera, do process the UTF-8 signature\ncorrectly.\n(should we say \"windows-based\"? for Mozilla and Opera it is\nprobably true for other platforms.)\n\n\nb) For the next para, perhaps after \"manually\" add \"with an\neditor\". In second sentence perhaps change \"can remove\" to\n\"automate removal of\":\n\nTo remove the extra line or spaces that appear in the\nbrowser, remove the bytes that represent the UTF-8\nsignature. You can remove them manually or with a script.\nOne of the benefits of using a script is that you can\nremove the signature from multiple files.\n\nc) For next para, I would change \"cause of extra line...\"\nto \"UTF-8 signature\".\nAlso, we should include the other way to remove bom- An\neditor that is bom-aware might have an option to save\nwithout the bom. So you might not need to edit it, just\nopen and save correctly.\n\nYou may not be able to see the cause of the extra line or\nspace in your editor, if it handles the UTF-8 signature\ncorrectly. An editor which does not handle the UTF-8\nsignature correctly displays the bytes that compose that\nsignature according to its own character encoding setting.\nWith the Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1) character encoding, the\nsignature displays as extraneous characters ???. With a\nbinary editor capable of displaying the hexadecimal byte\nvalues in the file, the UTF-8 signature displays as EF BB\nBF.\n\nd) next para is fine, but I would move \"thoroughly\" after\n\"signature. Also instead of \"but that\" use \"but note that\nonly\", and add to the end something like \", so look\nspecifically for some of these chars to check.\"\n\nYou should check thoroughly the result of removing the\nsignature, bearing in mind that pages with a high\nproportion of Latin characters may look correct\nsuperficially but that characters outside the ASCII range\n(U+0000 to U+007F) may be incorrectly encoded.\n\nIf there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the\nbeginning of the file, then your problem lies elsewhere.\n\ne) For the following para- how do we mean \"include\"? Also,\nif embedded in the middle of the file it is likely going to\ndisplay as something other than blank lines, no?\n\nNote that if you include text from a separate file that has\na UTF-8 signature at the top you may find blank lines\nappearing within the page, rather than just at the top.\n\n\n\nOn Tue, 25 Nov 2003 17:49:19 -0000\n \"Richard Ishida\" <ishida@w3.org> wrote:\n> \n> Chaps,\n> \n> After discussion with Deborah I have uploaded another\n> version of\n>\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-utf8-bom.html\n> that includes\n> Martin's comments.  \n> \n> Let's try to publish this on Thursday.

You can't just have\nthe JSP container omit to mention the charset in the HTTP header because the\nencoding is important in the lifecycle of a JSP page: JSP pages are compiled\ninto servlets. That is, they are turned into a small Java program that\ngenerates the HTML. The HTML content in a JSP page just becomes a series of\nJava String objects inside the servlet. The Strings must be converted back\nto bytes using some encoding (since Strings are UTF-16 based Java objects).\nYou set the encoding used for this conversion with the page contentType\ndirective.\n\nSo you see: if you don't tell JSP container's servlet generate what encoding\nyou want, it has to make some assumption.\n\nThere is another part to this process as well: you have to generate the\nservlet (i.e. those String objects) to begin with. Parsing the HTML to look\nfor a META tag is not a really reliable solution. So unless the file is\nentirely ASCII to begin with, you have to tell the JSP container how to read\nthe bytes in the file to generate the servlet. This is what the pageEncoding\ndirective does.\n\nOne could argue with the choice of Latin-1 as the JSP default, but any other\nencoding, including UTF-8, wouldn't really solve the problem: people want to\nuse legacy encodings from time to time as well.

If you use pageEncoding on its own, it\nis assumed that the encoding of the source JSP file should be the encoding\nused to deliver the file. If you use contentType on its own, then the page\nis delivered in the encoding specified, but read as Latin-1. If you want to\nuse one encoding (say KS-X-1001) for the JSP file and a different encoding\nfor the delivery (say UTF-8) then you can use both directives together.\n\nFor example, see Norbert Lindeberg's excellent article here:\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Intl/MultilingualJ\nSP/\n\nIn addition, the pageEncoding is how the JSP container reads the .jsp file\nin, but the resulting servlet may not be written in the specified encoding\n(e.g. the javac invocation might not use an -encoding directive).\n\nOne more note: if your JSP page reads data from a HttpServletRequest object,\nyou may have to call the setCharacterEncoding() method on that object before\nretrieving parameters sent to your JSP page via GET or POST.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\n\n\n"

This week touching on translation.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org [mailto:w3c-wai-gl-request@w3.org] On\nBehalf Of Wendy A Chisholm\nSent: 25 September 2003 20:23\nTo: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org\nSubject: 24 Sept Techniques Task Force telecon Summary\n\n\n\nAttending: Sailesh Panchang, Tom Croucher, David MacDonald, Chris\nRidpath, \nWendy Chisholm\nRegrets: Michael Cooper, Ben Caldwell\n\nThe Techniques Task Force has been discussing personae and use cases for\n\nthe last few weeks in an effort to answer the following questions in\norder \nto create an informed design:\n1.  Who is the primary audience for Gateway to Techniques?  for \ntechnology-specific techniques?\n2. How will they use it?\n3. What are their needs?\n4. What is the best way to lead people from Checkpoints and Success \nCriteria to non-technology specific techniques to technology-specific \ntechniques?\n5. We will end up with a lot of information, how will people find what\nthey \nare looking for?\n\nSince Ben and Michael both sent regrets, the focus of this discussion\nwas \nuser scenarios and personae.  David created a cast of personae based on \ninterviews with people from a variety of backgrounds (a person who\nwrites \ncontracts, a person who develops policy, etc.).  He will do some more \nresearch on a few of them and send notes to the list.  The feedback\nabout \nWCAG 1.0 is very useful and some of the needs they expressed should be\nkept \nin mind for WCAG 2.0.\n\nTom then discussed thoughts about use cases Sailesh had sent to Tom.\n\nThis lead into a discussion about cultural differences and how to take \nthose into account while developing WCAG 2.0.  In particular, are the\nterms \nwe are using in WCAG 2.0 easy to translate? \"Transform gracefully\" from \nWCAG 1.0 was difficult for some of the translators.  What about\ncountries \nor languages where information about Web accessibility has not been \ntranslated into their language and they rely on English versions?  What \nabout concepts that are difficult to translated? Is there anything in\nWCAG \n2.0 that might be offensive?  Especially in techniques where we have \nexamples, what process will we use to translate the techniques\ndocuments?\n\nSailesh informed us about India, Tom spoke about Europe, and we\ndiscussed \nthe need to develop better contacts in Asia and Africa.  Wendy provided\nan \nupdate about the effort to develop contacts in Japan and China. We are \nattempting to hold a WCAG WG meeting in November in Tokyo to  as well as\n\nsetting up a variety of meetings with people to increase the dialogue\nabout \nWCAG 2.0 and Japanese-specific concerns.  Judy Brewer and other WAI\nstaff \nare heading to Beijing this fall to further dialogue in that region.\n\nThis lead to discussion of the W3C Glossary project, the WAI Glossary,\nand \nthe WCAG 2.0 Glossary.  One goal of the Glossary projects is to create a\n\nlist of terms that will be one of the first documents translated.  This \nshould help people who have some knowledge of English, but would like to\n\nlook up particular phrases in a glossary that has been translated into \ntheir primary language.  It will also give us an opportunity to look at \ntranslation difficulty before sending WCAG 2.0 through the\nRecommendation \ntrack.  This discussion highlighted the need to increase the priority on\n\nthe glossary work.\n\nThere is a public mailing list for the W3C glossary work: \nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-glossary/\nAn announcement on 19 Sept [1] provides a look at the first phase of the\n\nGlossary work: a searchable database of terms used in W3C\nspecifications.\n\nWe resolved that these are all issues for the larger group to discuss\nand \nare looking for an opportunity to get them on a Thursday call.\n\nBest,\n--wendy\n\n[1]\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-glossary/2003Sep/0000.html\n\n-- \nwendy a chisholm\nworld wide web consortium\nweb accessibility initiative\nhttp://www.w3.org/WAI/\n/-- \n\n\n\n"

It will make it\n   easier for people to decide whether they want to read this part or not.\n\n- Change \"(also known as Unicode)\" to \"(equivalent to Unicode)\" or\n   \"(codepoint-by-codepoint equivalent to Unicode)\". I agree with Russ\n   that it's not the same, but we should also be careful not to give\n   the impression that it is more different than it actually is.\n\n- We (Richard and I, not the Task Force) have to come up with a clear plan\n   how to avoid duplication of items, e.g.\n   http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-charset.html and\n   http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-doc-charset.html.\n   We can put a reference from the former to the later.\n   We can put a redirect in the .htaccess, and remove the former\n   document (that would help to clear up the top /International\n   directory).

I just skimmed over it quickly\nand came up with a couple of comments.\n\n  In 4.1 Choosing & specifying fonts, it has to be noted that\nwhenever localized font names (family names) are specified (in CSS),\nall-ASCII font names should be specified alongside because localized\nfont names (in characters outside US-ASCII) are not available on all\nplatforms and nor  recognized by all user agents. For instance, the name\nof a font returned by Win32 font-related APIs depends on the default\nsystem locale so that on fonts whose name are   specified in Japanese\n(Chinese/Korean) [1] wouldn't be matched by most [2] user-agents running\non non-Japanese(Chinese/Korean) Windows. Another example is fontconfig\nlibrary used by both Mozilla and Konqueror on Linux and other free\nUnix. It doesn't yet support international localized font names. Yet\nanother example is XLFD (X11 Logical Font Description) still widely used\non commercial Unix despite a number of shortcomings. AFAIK, XLFD doesn't\nsupport anything other than US-ASCII in all its fields (including foundry\nand family name fields). Given all these, it's essential that family\nnames be specified in US-ASCII only strings (along with localized names).\n\n In 14.1 Date & Time, it's adised that 'words for the month be used and\nan example (02 mar 2004) is given. I'm not sure of the wisdom of this.\nFor speakers of European languages, that may be a good advice, but\nfor East Asian users, that doesn't seem to as good (and I'm not sure\nof other regions/languages). At the minimum, YYYY-MM-DD format (as\nspecified in ISO 8601) should be mentioned as a rather universal and\nculture/language-neutral alternative.\n\n  Jungshik\n\n\n[1] Win32 APIs return localized family names only on CJK windows.\n[2] It's certainly possible that user agents themselves can look 'deep'\ninside a font to figure out ASCII or localized family name even though\nthe OS API doesn't.\n\n\n\n"

It's laudable that they use UTF-8 for WS\npages, but that seems to be about as far as they go in terms of I18N and\nstandard compliance.  I've just found that even that is only the case\nof scripts for which there's no widely supported legacy encoding. Their\nChinese pages are in GB2312. Well, I can't blame them for using GB2312\nfor Chinese and Windows-1251 for Russian, but I'm now even less\n'impressed' by the degree of I18N at BBC WS pages.\n\n  A couple of times, I wrote to BBC that they need to specify the language\nwith 'lang' (or 'xml:lang') for their WS pages, but I have yet to hear\nback, let alone seeing it get fixed.\n\n  Web pages of other news media are hardly better than BBC. For\ninstance, NYTimes.com uses Windows-1252, but most of their pages are not\ntagged at all (or use a broken construct like 'meta http-equiv=\"charset\"\ncontent=\"iso-8859-1\"' [1]) so that I almost always have to manually set the\nencoding (because my default is not Windows-1252). I'm wondering if\nwe can (GEO) do something about this (contacting web masters of those\nsites wearing a kind of 'official' hat).\n\n\n  Jungshik\n\n[1] Yes, they claim that their pages are in 'iso-8859-1' although they're\nactually in Windows-1252. Most browsers can cope with this kind of\nmistagging (ISO-8859-1 < Windows-1252, EUC-KR < x-Windows-949, TIS620 <\nISO-8859-11 < x-Windows-874, GB2312 < GBK < GB18030) having seen so many\nof them, but I wonder where they picked up the idea of a separate meta\ntag declaration for 'charset'.\n\n\n\n"

It's laudable that they use UTF-8 for WS\npages, but that seems to be about as far as they go in terms of I18N and\nstandard compliance.  I've just found that even that is only the case\nof scripts for which there's no widely supported legacy encoding. Their\nChinese pages are in GB2312. Well, I can't blame them for using GB2312\nfor Chinese and Windows-1251 for Russian, but I'm now even less\n'impressed' by the degree of I18N at BBC WS pages.\n\n  A couple of times, I wrote to BBC that they need to specify the\nlanguage\nwith 'lang' (or 'xml:lang') for their WS pages, but I have yet to hear\nback, let alone seeing it get fixed.\n\n  Web pages of other news media are hardly better than BBC. For\ninstance, NYTimes.com uses Windows-1252, but most of their pages are not\ntagged at all (or use a broken construct like 'meta http-equiv=\"charset\"\ncontent=\"iso-8859-1\"' [1]) so that I almost always have to manually set\nthe\nencoding (because my default is not Windows-1252). I'm wondering if\nwe can (GEO) do something about this (contacting web masters of those\nsites wearing a kind of 'official' hat).\n\n\n  Jungshik\n\n[1] Yes, they claim that their pages are in 'iso-8859-1' although\nthey're\nactually in Windows-1252. Most browsers can cope with this kind of\nmistagging (ISO-8859-1 < Windows-1252, EUC-KR < x-Windows-949, TIS620 <\nISO-8859-11 < x-Windows-874, GB2312 < GBK < GB18030) having seen so many\nof them, but I wonder where they picked up the idea of a separate meta\ntag declaration for 'charset'.\n\n\nBBCi at http://www.bbc.co.uk/\n\nThis e-mail (and any attachments) is confidential and may contain\npersonal views which are not the views of the BBC unless specifically\nstated.\nIf you have received it in error, please delete it from your system. \nDo not use, copy or disclose the information in any way nor act in\nreliance on it and notify the sender immediately.

If you have the original in mixed case,\nthen lowercasing works quite well, because there are no words\nthat start with an (uppercase) sz. (again, that makes sense,\nbecause otherwise, there would be an uppercase sz)\n\nThere is another issue, however, that can cause problems:\nTo shorten text while being politically correct, there is\nthe convention to use upper case in the middle of a word,\ni.e. \"Studenten and Studentinnen\" (students (male) and\nstudents (female)) is shortened to \"StudentINNen\". The\nstylistic uppercasing of this is \"STUDENTinnEN\", and\nI guess the stylistic lowercasing would be \"studentINNen\".\nThis probably could be taken care of by some context analysis,\nit wouldn't need a dictionary.\n\nRegards,     Martin.\n\n\n\n"

The technique in question seems to be\nreasonable as it is in the editor's copy.  It also has to be noted that\na lot of dynamic contents are generated with charset emitted in http\nheader.\n\n>> There may be\n>> exceptional cases, such as Tim Bray's site, where he only uses server\n>> settings because he has complete control over his pages and\n>> environment.\n\n  In case of Apache,  as is well known, unless the system admin blocks\nusers from configuring http header for their documents, individual users\n(non-admin) do have a complete control over their documents served by\nApache. I realize it's not the case with other servers (especially with\nIIS), but my point is that Tim Bray is not the only one with a complete\ncontrol.\n\n\n>> ACTION: Tex, look at Google's cache to see how that works vis a vis\n>> transcoding\n\n  To my surprise, google's cache doesn't transcode. Instead, it serves\ncached documents in their *original* encoding with  html meta tag with\nC-T charset prepended. (I made sure that google does that even when\nthe original documents don't have html meta tag.)  Actually, the way\ngoogle serves cached pages is not standard-compliant because it\nblindly emits 'meta information' (with actual html tags like table)\nbefore <html> as shown below (so that thosed cached pages wouldn't get\nvalidated).\n\n------------Cut-----------Here---------------\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=EUC-KR\">\n<base HREF=\"http://www.msquare.or.kr/\">\n<table border=1 ....\n\n....... disclaimer and other meta information......\n\n<!--- the original page conent begins here : comment is mine -->\n<html>\n...... original content .....\n----------------------\n\n  Jungshik\n\n\n\n"

For\nexample, my feedback (and my brother's) on Korean fonts (the one\ngiven as sans-serif is actually 'serif-like' while the one listed as\nserif is sans-serif) hasn't been acted on. Perhaps, we can make a more\ncomprehensive list by merging Richard's (that probably includes that\nof CSS1), Mozilla's and other source (I'm familar with what fonts are\nshipped by various linux distributions).\n\n> Your comment on font names could make a good FAQ.

            "content": "Greetings all!\n\nBelow is the Q&A about setting encoding in various web authoring\napplications. Your feedback is appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nPhil Arko\nSr. Human Factors Engineer\nSiemens Corporate Research\nUser Interface Design Center\n\n\n\n==============================================\nSETTING ENCODING IN WEB AUTHORING APPLICATIONS\n==============================================\n\n\nQUESTION\n\nHow do I set character encoding in my web authoring application?\n[??? or: \"Where is the feature hidden in my application?\" ???]\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nContent on the web can be authored using a variety of software applications.\nEven within a single site, the content may have been created using multiple\nauthoring tools. For example, a website that was created using Macromedia\nDreamweaver might also include a page created using Microsoft Access' data\naccess page feature, as well as a dynamic Flash movie that allows for\nlanguage selection. In order for all of these files to properly serve the\ncorrect text, they need to be properly encoded.\n\nThis article is not meant to be a tutorial on defining and using character\nencoding within the web authoring applications, but rather to identify where\nsome of the key functionality exists. This is not a complete listing of\nsoftware, but rather a collection of some of the more popular web authoring\napplications in use\n\nAs software evolves, it is possible that the location of the functionality\nmay change. In addition, specific options of character encodings may vary\ndepending on the user's installation version and location, and so these are\nnot discussed in detail for each application. For more detailed information,\nrefer to the specific application's help content or user manuals. Common\nkeywords for searches include Character Encoding, Internationalization,\nMultilingual, Unicode, and UTF.\n\nThere are two main points to remember when creating properly encoded files:\n\n     1. the markup within the document must properly designate the encoding\n(such as charset=iso-8859-1 in an XHTML/HTML meta tag, or encoding=\"UTF-8\"\nin an XML declaration statement).\n\n     2. the file, itself, must be saved in the proper encoding format (such\nas UTF-8).\n\nMost of these applications will save the file in the proper format, but may\nnot input the proper markup within the document.\n\nAnother key element in the markup is the language indicator. Many of the\napplications listed here combine the encoding and language in the\nuser-selectable options. If the language is not included by the application,\nit is good practice to also include that in the markup manually. Some\napplications may acquire the regional settings of your operating system to\ncreate a locale tag.\n\n\n\nANSWER\n\n[??? Adobe Acrobat ???]\n[??? can't find anything specific yet ???]\n\n\n[??? Adobe FrameMaker ???]\n[??? can't find anything specific yet ???]\n\n\nAdobe GoLive 5.0 (Mac)\n[??? Newer version?, PC version the same? ???]\n\nTo specify the character encoding for your pages, go to Edit > Preferences >\nEncodings category.\n\n\n[??? Adobe Page Maker ???]\n[??? can't find anything specific yet ???]\n\n\nApple TextEdit\n\nYou will need to input the proper encoding into the XHTML/HTML file. Files\nare natively saved as UTF-8, so no further action is necessary.\n\n\nMacromedia ColdFusion (Windows)\n\nTo properly configure a ColdFusion application, become familiar with the\nvarious encoding-related commands and functions (a few of which include\n\"setEncoding,\" \"cfcontent,\" and the form attribute \"enctype\").\n\n\nMacromedia Dreamweaver MX (Mac & Windows)\n\nTo specify the character encoding for your pages, go to Modify > Page\nProperties. Select the proper encoding from the \"Document Encoding\" dropdown\nmenu.\n\nTo specify the character encoding for viewing pages while editing, go to\nEdit > Preferences > Fonts category (Dreamweaver > Preferences > Fonts\ncategory on Mac).\n\n\nMacromedia Flash MX (Mac & Windows)\n\nWhen efficiently designed, multilingual Flash movies often store the text\nfor each language in separate include files (#include), reducing the time\nneeded to download a flash movie by only sending the selected language data.\nUTF-8 text can be stored in an include file. The include file should start\nwith \"//!-- UTF8\" and must be saved in UTF-8 format.\n\nUTF-8 character notation can also be specified in Flash's ActionScript\nenvironment. U+0000 would be written using the escape sequence \"\\u0000\"\nwithin the ActionScript code.\n\nAnother setting worth noting is the encoding setting for the end-user's\nFlash Player. This is defaulted to false (system.useCodepage = false;),\nwhich will use UTF-8. There are times when this may have been changed for\nsome special purpose, but must be changed back to \"false\" before displaying\nUTF-8 text again by placing the proper ActionScript in the timeline before\ncalling any new text.\n\n\nMacromedia HomeSite+\n\nYou need to input the encoding information in the file. You can then go to\nFile > Save As and select the proper encoding using the Encoding dropdown\nmenu.\n\nThere is also an HTML Tidy feature that can check your code as you type. The\nencoding options are located here: Options > Settings > CodeSweeper category\n> HTML Tidy CodeSweeper subcategory > Macromedia HTML subcategory > Char\nencoding dropdown menu.\n\n\nMicrosoft Office -- Access, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word (version 2000 for\nWindows, version X for Mac OS X)\n[??? NEED TO CHECK IF THIS IS THE SAME IN OFFICE XP ???]\n\nMicrosoft Word is often used to export documents directly to HTML.\nIncreasingly, spreadsheets and presentations (from Excel and PowerPoint,\nrespectively) are also being exported to web pages. Exporting database\ncontent into web pages has become easier for the desktop user with the\naddition of data access pages within Microsoft Access (Windows only).\n\nSelect \"Tools > Options > General tab > Web Options button > Encoding tab.\"\nSelect the appropriate selection in the \"Save document as\" dropdown menu.\n\nNote: In Access, first open the data access page in design view.\n\n\nMicrosoft Frontpage 2000 (Windows)\n\nThe encoding options are under \"Language (character set).\" Go to: Tools >\nPage Options > Default Font tab. You will notice an option that says\n\"Multilingual (UTF-8).\"\n\n\nMicrosoft Notepad (Windows)\n\nIf you create or edit documents using Notepad, you will need to specify the\ncharacter encoding and language when you write the markup code. When you\nsave the document, select \"File > Save as\" and select the proper encoding\nfrom the Encoding dropdown list at the bottom. Be aware that there is a\nknown issue with this, which can be fixed with a Pearl script. [??? CAN\nANYONE PROVIDE MORE INFO ABOUT THIS ???]\n\n\nHelios TextPad\n\nThe proper markup for encoding will need to be entered into the file. When\nsaving the document, the proper file format can be selected here: File >\nSave As > Encoding dropdown menu.\n\n\nW3C Amaya (Mac, Unix, Windows)\n\nWhen saving the file, go to File > Save as. Amaya will make sure that the\nencoding is correct in the xml declaration (for XHTML) and the <meta>\nstatement. Amaya also uses the appropriate encoding ('charset') in the HTTP\nheaders when it saves a document remotely using PUT. Amaya also understands\nseveral other encodings when loading a document, but is not able so save in\nany of these.\n\n\n\nBY THE WAY\n\nKeep in mind that the end user can select both the encoding to use, as well\nas the font to use for each encoding [??? CAN THIS BE OVERWRITTEN BY CSS\n???]. For example in Microsoft Internet Explorer, the current encoding can\nbe viewed (and revised) by going to the cascading menus under View >\nEncoding. Note that \"Right-To-Left Document\" or \"Left-To-Right Document\"\nwill also appear when it has been set.\n\nAnother option that is selectable by the user for Internet Explorer users is\nthe option to \"Always send URLs as UTF-8.\" This can be found here: Tools >\nInternet Options > Advanced tab > Browsing category.\n\nWhen content is ready to be published, it is good practice to also validate\nyour content using the W3 validation tool [http://validator.w3.org/ ].\n\n\n\nLINKS\n\nHints & Tips: Character Encodings\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/O-charset.html\n\nUnicode Enabled Products\nhttp://www.unicode.org/onlinedat/products.html\n\nEncoding Forms\nhttp://www.unicode.org/standard/principles.html#Encoding_Forms\n\n\n\n"

Deprecate text/* for anything that's in XML.  That's because it \nforces the provider to provide a charset header, because in its absence \nthe receiver is required to assume either ASCII or 8859 depending on the\n\ncontext, which has a very high probability of being wrong, which is \nirritating because if there were no charset header the client would have\n\nan excellent chance of getting it right.  And forcing the server to \nprovide a charset= is wrong; see the next point.,\n\n2. Deprecate the charset parameter for application/xml and \napplication/*+xml.  I think that Roy would like to go far as to simply \noutlaw it; I'd be fine with that too.  The reason is that the client is \nalmost certain to get it right, and will fail deterministically if it \ndoesn't.  For the server, on the other hand, this is really hard to get \nright, particularly with the introduction of various kinds of filters in\n\nmodern web servers.  And since the Web architecture and the XML spec \nsays that the server's claim has to be taken as authoritative, this is \nreally highly dysfunctional.  At the very least, it should be made clear\n\nthat nobody sending a media-type should send a charset for an XML \nmedia-type unless it REALLY REALLY KNOWS what it's sending, and in that \ncase should consider not sending it anyhow.\n\nMakoto, Simon, Dan, any chance?  It's going to be kind of embarrassing \nfor TAG findings and the Webarch doc to be saying \"don't do what this \nRFC says\".\n-- \nCheers, Tim Bray\n         (ongoing fragmented essay: http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/)\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------- -\n        Visit our Internet site at http://www.reuters.com\n\nGet closer to the financial markets with Reuters Messaging - for more\ninformation and to register, visit http://www.reuters.com/messaging\n\nAny views expressed in this message are those of  the  individual\nsender,  except  where  the sender specifically states them to be the\nviews of Reuters Ltd.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi Martin,\n\nThanks for putting some thought into this.  I also think your approach\nof suggesting the techniques before working on the detail is a very good\none.\n\nUnfortunately, I disagree with your proposal in a couple of areas.  I'll\nmake notes below, then suggest an alternative.\n\nMy understanding is that we currently have the possibility of covering\npages served in a number of ways:\nHTML\nXHTML 1.0 served as HTML (ie. text/html)\nXHTML 1.0 served as XML (ie. application/xhtml+xml,\napplication/xml, or text/xml)\nXHTML 1.1\n\nI think in Montreal you and I agreed that in the guidelines we should\ndefine 'xhtml 1.0 served as xml' to be 'served as application/xhtml+xml'\nonly for the purposes of the guidelines, which narrows the field a\nlittle.\n\nI have to admit that I still have an open question in my mind as to\nwhether we should write guidelines about xhtml served as xml at all,\nsince IE with its vast market share only displays it as code.  (That\nwill be the subject of another email.)\n\nI think the usage scenarios we are recommending for charset declaration\nare:\n\nHTML\nHTTP yes\nxml declno\nmetayes\n\nXHTML 1.0 as text/html\nHTTPyes\nxml declyes, if used\nmetayes\n\nXHTML as xml (1.0 and 1.1)\nHTTPyes\nxml declyes\nmetano\n\n\nI think these are equally applicable whether you use standards mode or\nnot, and whether or not you use transitional or strict approaches (where\nrelevant).\n\n\nMy concern with the techniques you are proposing is that the new points,\nand to some extent the second point, are (albeit good advice) not\nspecifically relevant to internationalization.

Leaving out the XML declaration may in\nsome cases be a choice independent of i18n issues, but in\nothers, it clearly isn't.\n\nThis includes cases where people want to serve one and the same\nfile as text/html and as application/xhtml+xml.\n\nRegards,    Martin.\n\n\n\n>C] Use the meta element to explicitly declare the document's character\n>encoding for HTML documents and XHTML documents served as text/html.\n>(same as you suggested)\n>\n>\n>However, I think that the new points you included are well worth saying,\n>but as notes rather than separate techniques - in fact, I think you have\n>to mention these things as part of the explanation of the techniques\n>mentioned above anyway.

Anything you would remove?\n\n1) Charset\nchoose encoding that maximizes representation of characters you use.\nutf-8 recommended.\nlabel encodings in html, xhtml, css. Set http. Also form accept-charset.\nDon't label anchors and links with encoding.\n\n2) language\nLabel language of your pages. (lang, xml:lang)\n\n3) Styling\nUse CSS, don't embed fonts etc. in html.\nUse serif, sans-serif font fallbacks.\nUse logical not presentational names\nUse before and after, not right and left names.\n\nUse resizable layouts and relative sizing and positioning. \n(consider div instead of tables)\nDon't use absolute font sizes.\n\nDon't use css language selectors, they don't work on all browsers.\nFor styles that are specific to a language, and need to coexist with other\nlanguages in a common stylesheet and web page, use language id as part of the\nstyle name.\n\n4) web site Organization\ndirectory and filenaming recommendations...\nlanguage selection recommendations\nacquiring international domain names\n\n==============\nOK, the last 2 language selection and acquiring domains are probably deferable.\n\nI find the hardest thing on the list to be \"resizable\" layouts.\nI see many tricks and example code offered on the web and in books that\nhardwires font-size and/or widths.\nI find resizing very difficult on my own pages.\nI'd like to develop a page of techniques and tips for this.\nSuggestions or places to point at?\n\ntex\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------\nTex Texin   cell: +1 781 789 1898   mailto:Tex@XenCraft.com\nXen Master                          http://www.i18nGuy.com\n                         \nXenCraft            http://www.XenCraft.com\nMaking e-Business Work Around the World\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n"

            "subject": "Relationships of outline, notes and ua applicability inf",
            "content": "Folks,\n\nOne of Karl Dubost's comments on the techniques plunged us into confusion during today's meeting.  Here is what I took away wrt the problem statement and potential solution.  Comments?\n\nThe basic Problem:\n==================\nHow do we reconcile (1) Notes documents containing techniques descriptions that are frozen in time with (2) the need to represent constantly changing information about UA applicability of techniques?\n\n\nBackground\n==========\nI will refer to the short summary of a technique here as a 'recommendation'. The long version with explanations and examples is the 'detail'.\n\nWe are producing the detailed techniques info as multiple W3C Notes, that will be individually frozen at certain, not necessarily the same, dates.  We may, however, create new editor's drafts pretty soon after a Note is released, where we can add, modify, or remove specific techniques.  These editor's WD's will eventually turn into new versions of a particular Note, obsoleting the previous version.\n\nOn the other hand, we don't want to have lots of different outline documents tied to specific Note releases (as was the case previously when we generated the outline from a single document). The idea is to have a single, evergreen outline document at a fixed URI that lists the short summary of all techniques and points to whatever is the appropriate place to find the detail.\n\nWe'd also like to ensure that as new versions of user agents become available, that we can update the information about their applicability to techniques.  Previously all such information was derived from the same location as the technique detail and displayed in the detailed descriptions.  However, once a Note has been published as such, we cannot change it. It would be easy to manage UA applicability information if the information about UA support were at a separate URI, but we feel it is important to have this information available on the same page as the technique recommendation.\n\n\nWay forward\n===========\nAs I see it:\n\nWhen we release a Note, it is a self-contained unit that, if it includes information about UA support (see below), does so according to our best knowledge  at the date of the release of the Note.\n\nThere is one outline document for all techniques.  This outline doc is a view that is created by hand, so it is relatively flexible.  We can point to detail for a given recommendation either in a published version of a Note, or, alternatively, in a new editor's draft. We can do that on a recommendation by recommendation basis.  \n\nWe should also work on the mechanism for extracting information about UA support so that it doesn't necessarily extract the informaiton from the place where we point to for detail (which is currently the case).\n\nFor example: Suppose we release a techniques Note about language use that includes a section on use of the :lang selector and containing no information about language-related meta elements. Then we begin a new editor's draft of the Note, where we add information about (not) using language-related meta tags.  Assume also that IE suddenly begins supporting the :lang selector.\n\nThe outline document may point to the released Note for information about use of the :lang selector, but point to the editor's draft for new recommendations relating to use of the language-related meta element.  Probably all information about UA applicability should be pulled from the editor's draft where it is kept up to date - ie. we may pull it from a different place than we point to for the detail.  There should be a health warning in the released Note about the freshness of the UA applicability information in it, or (and I'm leaning this way) we should omit that information in the published Note (presenting it only in the outline view).\n\nOne thing this would mean is that if we publish a new version of a Note, we should change all the links to detail in the outline so that they refer to the new document rather than the previous version.\n\nUnless I get comments to the contrary, I'll proceed down this path.\n\nRI\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ncontact info:\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ \n\nW3C Internationalization:\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/ \n \n\n\n\n"

The section on language tagging -\n> <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-i18n-html-tech-20031009/\n> #ri20030218.131124329> - doesn't clarify something that the \n> HTML specification doesn't make clear. If a document contains \n> 2 languages, can you use\n> \n>     <html lang=\"it en\">\n> \n> or is this wrong?\n\n\nMultiple languages in the <html> tag are not allowed.  RFC3066 provides the\nrules for these values.\n\nIt may be possible to do this in the HTTP header - we will look into it -\nbut it is not clear to us that user agents would know what to do in such a\nsituation.\n\n\n\n> \n> 3. One use of hreflang is to allow for user-side addition of \n> graphic markers. A stylesheet rule such as\n> \n>     a[hreflang = en]:before { content: url('engflag.gif') } or\n>     a[hreflang = en]:before { content: url('OzFlag.gif') }\n> \n> or its XSLT equivalent\n> \n> allows people to select the way languages are represented - \n> avoiding a cultural insensitivity that causes many people to \n> otherwise avoid providing any graphic idenitfier - something \n> that would be helpful for low-literacy users in particular, \n> and provide rapid recognition for many people.\n\n\nThanks for bringing the use of hreflang to our attention.  We agree that we\nshould mention this type of usage in the document, although clearly signpost\nthat it doesn't work for IE and possibly other browsers (which makes its\napplication limited, unfortunately, at present, though we would like to see\nit become more widespread).  \n\nWhere we disagree is the use of flags.  These are associated with countries,\nrather than languages. We also feel that text would be better than graphics\non most user agents for people who need to view at larger sizes.  Karl\noutlines a method whereby the value of the hreflang attribute is used in\nsquare brackets.  This seems better, as it reduces complexity and bandwidth\n(albeit slightly).\n\n\n\n> \n> 4. No mention is made of the technique of using <link \n> rel=\"alternate\"  \n> hreflang=\"xx\" ...\n> \n> The link element is now widely implemented in browsers \n> (Internet Explorer and Safari are the only two reasonably \n> well-known browsers that don't implement it), and as a backup \n> for language negotitation (analagous to including charset \n> metadata) it seems worthwhile. It would also enable easier \n> searching for language variants rather than simply offering \n> auto-translated versions. Many large organisations make \n> extensive use of Dublin Core metadata, which would allow them \n> to generate this relatively simply...\n\n\nThanks for bringing this up.  We will look into it.  \n\nWe know that the link element is recognised in some user agents, but we are\nnot clear whether user agents do anything with the language related\ninformation specifically.

The icons don't have \n> tooltips -- maybe they need alt and title attribtes.  I had \n> no a priori idea what they did.\n\n\nThe latest versions of these documents (see above) and their accompanying\noutline work differently, so this is not an issue.  Currently there is only\nan icon to take you back to the toc in the outline, and I have ensured that\nthe title and alt information is available for that.\n\n\n\n> \n> [2] 2.2 item 2\n> In case of conflict, the Content-Type charset declaration and \n> the XML declaration have precedence over the meta charset \n> statement, according to the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 \n> specifications. [Ed. note: Is this true in practise? esp wrt IE?]\n> \n> It's true neither in practise nor according to the XML specification.\n> The HTTP Mime charset parameter overrides the encoding (if \n> any) given in any XML declaration. \n\n\nThat is indeed what we were trying to say.  The new version no longer\ncontains this sentence.\n\n\n> \n> [3] 2.2 further down (it'd help if the itens were numbered) \n> The meta declaration must only be used when the character \n> encoding is organized such that ASCII-valued bytes stand for \n> ASCII characters (at least until the meta element is parsed). \n> [Ed. note: How true is this?]\n> \n> If you send a document in ebcdic to IE, a meta element isn't \n> going to help you.  IE won't be able to parse the \"<\" sign \n> let alone \"M\" \"E\" \"T\"\n> \"A\" :-)\n\n\nTrue.  But we see this as a fringe case these days, and we hope that people\nwill choose other encodings than ebcdic in the future.  Those using ebcdic\nshould certainly use the HTTP header to declare the encoding, even though IE\n(I'm not sure how many others) can detect and handle ebcdic currently.  We\nwill add a note to this effect.\n\n\n> \n> \n> [4] NNavigator\n> \n> Probably you should use Mozila, not Netscape Navigator, now \n> that Netscape has disbanded its browser team.\n\nThat has already been addressed in the latest version of the outline.  We\nwill also change in the three WDs before publication.\n\n\n\n> \n> [5] 3.2 Specifying...\n> \n> According to the HTML specification, in a case of conflict \n> the HTTP charset declaration has the highest priority of all \n> means of declaring the character set.\n> \n> Correct.  Please make 2.2 consistent with this.\n\n\nSee above.\n\n\n\n> \n> [6] 3.3 Avoid escapes when the characters to be expressed are \n> representable in the character encoding of the document.\n> \n> Why?  It can be very convenient in some environments, for \n> example, to stick to 7-bit (\"ASCII\") values and to use \n> character references for all codpoints that require 8 or more \n> bits.  This can make document transportation and processing \n> significantly more robust.\n\n\nI'm not sure we can argue for better internationalization by recommending\nthe use of ASCII.  Note that we are talking specifically about HTML/XHTML\npages here.  Do you have some specific examples you could share with us?\n\n\n\n> \n> [7] 3.3\n> \n> Suggest ading a note about where character references can be \n> used -- e.g. you can't use them to escape characters in element names.\n> Maybe not necessary.\n\n\nWell probably not necessary in this particular document, since it is largely\nconcerned with the HTML vocabulary and we don't expect the majority of our\naudience to be creating new tags.  Worth mentioning elsewhere though.\n\n\n\n> \n> [8] 6.5\n> \n> Suggest documenting interaction with <span> and inline bidi \n> text; RTL and LTR marks are evil becasue non-hierarchical and \n> stateful.\n\n\nWe disagree and wonder whether you are thinking about the RLE and LRE (with\nPDF) characters.  We agree that the latter shouldn't be used for the reason\nyou mention. Perhaps we should make the distinction clearer and point to\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml/#Bidi .  In fact, we could even add a\ntechnique saying 'don't use RLE/RLO/etc'.\n\nFor information about RTL and LTR see\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#where (you\nmight want to read the whole article).\n\n\n\n> \n> [9] 6.7 Overriding\n> in the example box, the Hebrew text is in three different \n> sizes or fonts in the three places it appears.  Very minor \n> and probably a browser bug.\n\nThe first two examples are of code, so are in a code element.  The third\nshows what appears on the UI, so it is just normal text.  It's not clear to\nme why there would be 3 different appearances.  Do you still see it in\nsection 8 of http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html ?\n\n\n\n> \n> [1] Overall\n> As the draft is edited further, it might be an idea to reduce \n> some of the redundancy and combine some of the topics.  E.g. \n> logical vs visual order for Hebrew, dir=\"rtl\" to html or \n> body.  Repeated text can make people think they lost their \n> place, or can mean people read the wrong section or get confused.\n\n\nThe new approach removes this issue.  We don't repeat the detail text any\nmore, though we may point to it from various places in the overview\ndocument.\n\n\n> \n> *\n> \n> I hope these comments help - I think this will be a very \n> useful document and look forward to seeing future drafts!\n\n\nMany thanks for taking the time to review it!\nBest regards,\n\nRichard\nFor the GEO TF\n\n\n> \n> Liam\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> --\n> Liam Quin, W3C XML Activity Lead, liam at w3.org, \n> http://www.w3.org/People/Quin/ http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/\n> \n\n\n\n"

XML declaration\n    3. meta charset declaration\n    4. link charset attribute\n[...]\n\nThe XML declaration is just a processing instruction for HTML user\nagents and gets thus ignored (if you are lucky); also for XHTML\ndocuments delivered as text/html user agent behaivour variies (no\nsurprise since the specifications to not deal with it), e.g., the W3C\nMarkUp Validator reads the <meta> information while the W3C CSS\nValidator does not.\n\nWhere is the BOM? HTML 4.01 does not mention the BOM to determine the\ncharacter encoding of the document, neither does CSS 2.0... If user\nagents are somehow expected to use the BOM to determine the character\nencoding of the document, it should be listed here.\n\nI think this should be split into three parts, XML (XHTML, SVG, ...),\nHTML/XHTML (text/html) and CSS as they have different rules and user\nagent behaivour varies.\n\n[...]\n   The escape mechanism for representing characters in CSS is a\n   backslash followed by a hexadecimal number representing the scalar\n   value. Note that these escapes are terminated by a space, rather\n   than a semi-colon. The CSS escape for ? is \\E1.\n[...]\n\nOr they are not terminated at all (or implicitly), e.g. Bj\\F6rn or\nM\\0000F6bel as opposed to M\\F6bel (not \"M?bel\" but M U+F6BE l).\n\n\n\n"

The value of the lang attribute is\nusually a two-letter country code. (FAQ: Two-letter or three-letter\nlanguage codes)\n\nWhere the language changes, that change should be clearly identified.\nFor example, <p lang=\"en\">He viewed Deidre's predicament with a certain\namount of <span lang=\"de\">Schadenfreude</span>.</p>\n\nHTML and XML have different syntax. When serving XHTML as text/html, you\nshould use both the lang attribute and the xml:lang attribute in the\nhtml element.\n(http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-lang.html)\n\neg: HTML: <html lang=\"fr-CA\">\n       XHTML 1.0 served as text/html: <html lang=\"zh-CN\"\nxml:lang=\"zh-CN\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n       \nFor more information on language tagging mark-up, see\n(http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html).\n\nCSS2 uses the 'lang' attribute powerfully as a pseudo class.\n(http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang.html).\n\nWhich tags? The attribute can be applied to any element except applet,\nbase, basefont, br, frame, frameset, iframe, param, or script.\n\nA common use for meta is to specify keywords that a search engine may\nuse to improve the quality of search results. When several meta elements\nprovide language-dependent information about a document, search engines\nmay filter on the xml:lang attribute to display search results using the\nlanguage preferences of the user.\n(http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20020805/mod-meta.html)\n\nFor example, \n\n<-- For speakers of US English -->\n<meta name=\"keywords\" lang=\"en-us\" \n         content=\"vacation, Greece, sunshine\"/>\n<-- For speakers of British English -->\n<meta name=\"keywords\" lang=\"en\" \n         content=\"holiday, Greece, sunshine\"/>\n<-- For speakers of French -->\n<meta name=\"keywords\" lang=\"fr\" \n         content=\"vacances, Gr&egrave;ce, soleil\"/>\n         \nThe lang attribute should be specified for alt-attributes and\nlongdesc-attributes.         \n\n\nUseful links\n\nHTML 4.01 Specification W3C Recommendation 24 December 1999:\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1.3.\nXHTML 2.0 W3C Working Draft 5 August 2002\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20020805/mod-meta.html\nWeb Accessbility Initiative: lang attribute -\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/#gl-abbreviated-and-foreign\nTutorial: Language markup in XHTML and CSS (DRAFT):\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-lang.html\nFAQ: Styling using the lang attribute:\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang.html\nFAQ: Two-letter or three-letter language codes:\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-2or3.html\n\n\n\nBBCi at http://www.bbc.co.uk/\n\nThis e-mail (and any attachments) is confidential and may contain\npersonal views which are not the views of the BBC unless specifically\nstated.\nIf you have received it in error, please delete it from your system. \nDo not use, copy or disclose the information in any way nor act in\nreliance on it and notify the sender immediately.

Borrowed\nterms are rather controversial - when are they part of the language and when\nnot?  (WAI is struggling with this at the moment.)  A useful example is \"The\nFrench word for 'cat' is 'chat'.\" because the french bit is ambiguous (could\nsound like English).\n\nMaybe have some subheadings.  Eg.\nWhat is it?\nWhy is it needed?\nHow do you use it? (which is what now follows)\n\n\n> \n> HTML and XML have different syntax.

Maybe better use another, since\nzh-Hans now would be more appropriate.  (I know I used that in my tutorial,\nbut I correct it later - maybe I should change it too.)\n\n\n>        \n> For more information on language tagging mark-up, see \n> (http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html).\n> \n> CSS2 uses the 'lang' attribute powerfully as a pseudo class. \n> (http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang.html).\n\nWell, 'can use it' - unfortunately it doesn't work in IE yet.  But the\nconcept of language specific styling is a very powerful one, which could\nmaybe be brought out by some examples.\n\n\n> \n> Which tags? The attribute can be applied to any element \n> except applet, base, basefont, br, frame, frameset, iframe, \n> param, or script.\n\nIe.

I have found no practical benefit from this approach so far, but rather found that it just makes it harder to edit the techniques document, so I have now bypassed the repository, including all the content directly in the page linked to above by the first link.  We still create another view (eg the second link above) and can still copy technique units to other locations and documents.\n\nI'd also like to propose that we remove headings from the document unless there is associated content.  I suggest that we keep the full list of potential headings in a separate document.\n\nSome of these changes are made in the realisation that we will soon be rechartering, and it would be good to move the techniques document along, and publish another version quite soon.\n\n\nRI\n\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ncontact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ \n\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/ \nhttp://www.w3.org/International/geo/ \n\nW3C Internationalization FAQs http://www.w3.org/International/questions.html\nRSS feed: http://www.w3.org/International/questions.rss \n\n\n\n"

Sorry for taking so long to reply to your reply ;-)  And many\nthanks for taking so much time over this.\n\n\n> \n> Overall these are very good tests. I imagine the CSS working \n> group might want to borrow some of them for the CSS2.1 test \n> suite when we start collecting tests for that. :-)\n\nI was hoping that might be the case. :)  I'm interested in also knowing what\nyou are developing that we could scrounge. :-)\n\n\n\nOne thing I should say as a preface to my following comments is that, a\nshort while after sending you my initial request for review I spent a lot of\ntime considering what kind of tests we needed to provide, and how I should\napproach this given very real practical constraints on my time.  I'm sorry,\nit would have helped you to say this earlier, but I wasn't expecting you to\nreply by that time. I'll number these points so I can refer back later:\n\n[1] The audience for this format is content authors.  We are not testing\nagainst a specification. We are testing to be able to say whether the\nadvice, warnings or observations we make in our Authoring Techniques doc are\napplicable to various browsers.  So, for example, we are interested in\nwhether the scroll bar flips to the left when dir=\"rtl\" is applied to the\nhtml header - even though this is a browser quirk, since it is something our\nreaders will come across and want to know about.\n\n[2] One of my aims in the current approach to writing tests is to provide\npages that are educational and pretty easily understood by less technical\npeople than we.  This is one reason for grouping tests on to a single page,\nalthough I've tried to design the page so that it is not too hard to create\nCSS-like tests from what we've done when the need arises.\n\n[3] Another reason for grouping stuff on a page is simply that I currently\ndon't have the bandwidth to develop the ideal solution.  Again, I've tried\nto lean where possible to a situation that allows for small focussed tests\nto be carved out of the page.  (Things may improve as we may be able to\nbring in additional resources from a member.) I've tried to label stuff that\ncould be hidden from a QA engineer.\n\n\n\n> \n> \n> > The tests I have converted so far are:\n> >\n> > http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-css-lang.html\n> \n> Now redirects to\n>    http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-css-lang-1.html\n> \n> The main change I would suggest on this page would be to \n> remove the parts of the tests that explain what is going on, \n> e.g. \"The css says: *:lang(es) { color:green; }\" and \"The \n> lang and xml:lang attributes are set to \"es\".\".\n\nI'd like to keep these for the educational reasons mentioned above, but I\nshould certainly grey out some of the text.\n\n> \n> Also, the tests that should \"remain black\" shouldn't -- if \n> the test page has tests that should go green, then they \n> should _all_ go green. The best thing to do there is make two \n> pages, one for the \"positive\" tests, and one for the \n> \"negative\" tests. In the negative tests, you style them by \n> default green, then make the rules make them red if they match.\n\nYep.\n\n> \n> Finally, note that if a page is sent as text/html, it is \n> HTML, whether or not the DOCTYPE claims otherwise, and UAs \n> will therefore (correctly) not interpret xml:lang attributes. \n> Thus the test that checks that xml:lang is applied is wrong \n> as long as the test is sent as text/html.\n\nYes. I should fix that, and I should set up some XHTML1.1 and XHTML 1.0\nserved as XML tests.\n\n\n> \n> Same comments apply to -2 and -3.\n> \n> \n> > http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-bidi-blocks.html\n> \n> Redirects to:\n>    http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-dir-1.html\n> \n> This test seems pointless -- if the user agent can do \n> whatever it wants and still claim compliance, why test it? \n> (Note that no specification requires that the UA use \n> scrollbars, even.)\n\nSee point [1] above.\n\n\n> \n> \n> | http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-dir-2.html\n> \n> Remove text like \"The blocks here all inherit RTL \n> directionality from the <html> element.\", or at least comment \n> it out. Most QA engineers don't care, or understand, the \n> tests -- they just want to see if the UA passes or fails. \n> Once the test is found to fail, then they will always look at \n> the source -- often, at least with tests I normally work \n> with, it turns out the test is wrong. Thus the test's claims \n> can never be trusted. :-)\n\nYes, I understand.  My audience is not only QA engineers, but I've tried to\nmake it easy to adapt the tests for them later.\n\n\n> \n> Similarly, for the tests on this page, remove the sample \n> markup -- if the tester wants to know the markup, he'll look \n> at the source.\n> \n> The final thing on this test page is that while reference \n> renderings are quite useful, on my system they are radically \n> different from the actual rendering, due to differences in \n> fonts, anti-aliasing, and so forth. (And since I don't read \n> arabic, I actualy am having trouble working out if the \n> characters are the same.)\n> \n> Instead of a reference image, it might be better to have a \n> second way of rendering the same content, for example using \n> bidi overrides or left-to-right tables with no borders, with \n> each span in its own cell (a commonly used way of showing the \n> expected results of bidi rendering).\n\nUnfortunately I think that bidi overrides don't necessarily work on the UA,\nand table cells can be ordered differently depending on whether the UA\nsupports this stuff or not.\n\n\n> \n> Note, as an aside, that the alt texts of the images are very \n> poor -- when read on an aural browser, the tests would sound \n> like this: \"The following should look like this. \n> blablaW3Cblabla. The following should look like this. 1 2 3 \n> blablaW3Cblabla blablaW3Cblabla blablaW3Cblabla\". That's \n> probably not what you intended! :-) The alt text you give is \n> in fact better suited for the title attribute.\n\nThe alt text is repeated in the title attr. I think that there is little\npoint in using an aural browser on most of these tests, is there?  I could\ncertainly be wrong, but it seems to me that the results all require visual\nexamination (and in the case of bidi, there's nothing to test as the text\nwould just be read out in logical order).\n\n\n> \n> The same comments apply to -3 and -4.\n> \n> \n> | http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-inline-bidi-1.html\n> \n> Drop the <h2> headers and anything with class=notes, for the \n> same reasons as given for the previous tests. The notes about \n> using an alternative to reference rendering images and better \n> alt text apply here too.\n\nUnderstood. For QA engineers I was expecting that we should make different\nfiles where each section is a separate file (without grey text or headings.)\n\n\n> \n> The test that says \"Check the text between quotes is in the \n> same order.\" should just be \"Check looks the same (apart from \n> font differences).\" as for the others, since that applies \n> here too. Same with \"Check that all characters run in the \n> same direction.\", that should just be the same as the other \n\nYep.  Seems I already fixed some of those, but missed the one at the end.\n\n\n> tests. The exclamation mark ones make sense, since it is \n> sensible to draw attention to the likely problem in those \n> cases. However, I would suggest making two test pages for \n> this, one for the cases where the tests should just look the \n> same, and one for the exclamation mark cases. That would make \n> it easier to run through the tests quickly.\n> \n> \n> | http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-text-transform-1.html\n> \n> As per earlier comments, I would suggest removing most of the \n> introduction bit (or putting it in comments) and the \n> class=notes bits and <h2> headers.\n> \n> It would probably make sense to split this test into one test \n> per block of codepoints.\n\nYes. For QA folks.\n\n\n> \n> It might also be easier to use this test if the characters \n> were side by side, like this:\n> \n>    a  a\n>    b  b\n>    c  c\n>    d  d\n> \n> ...etc. For example, using a table.

Good idea.\n\n\n> \n> (Oops! That UA has a bug, as is obvious from the mismatched \n> letters at the end.)\n\nInteresting.  What UA is that?\n\n\n> \n> The cases that are undefined are probably not overly useful \n> in a testcase, since they don't test anything.\n\nYes, for QA engineers.  They are useful for content authors though.\n\n\n> \n> | http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-idn-1.html\n> | http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-idn-2.html\n> \n> These tests are good, except I would encourage you to use a \n> destination page more like this:\n> \n   http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/html/flow/object/pass.html\n\n> That makes it easier to determine what is going on for the tester.\n\nRight.\n\n\n\n\n| http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-utf8-signature-1.html\n\n> The second control should say \"These characters should display as\n> described: A-tilde, copyright sign ...\" instead of saying what they should\n_not_ look > like. :-)\n\nAh, actually I tried it that way originally, but the outcome may depend on\nthe default encoding used by the UA.\n\n> The \"Additional test\", as written, is not a test, but what I call a \"demo\"\n(it > doesn't say what _should_ happen, it merely demonstrates what _does_\nhappen). \n\nYes.\n\n>Since the behaviour is well defined for that test, I think it should define\nwhat _should_ happen (namely, three \"random\" characters should appear on the\nfirst line).\n\n> (And, as for the other tests, I would generally recommend cutting back on\nthe descriptive text.)\n\n\n| http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-ruby-markup-1.html\n| http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-ruby-markup-2.html\n\n> No new comments beyond those that are mentioned for earlier tests.\n\n\nI>  hope that helps.

Administrators can also take advantage of these commands. (I do note in para 3 and 4 the faq presumes the author, and distinguishes privs coming from the admin.)\n\n2) The faq mentions multiple approaches but then proceeds to discuss only one (multiviews). It was suggested that we clarify that within the faq and also in the question. Wording of the Q (to resolve pts 1 and 2), could be something like:\n\nHow does one set up language negotiation via Multiviews on an Apache Web Server?\n\n3) Answer, para 1\nWe didn't think that the lang. neg. should be presented as an either/or choice, since in the previous meetings on this topic we considered it was likely people would do a combined approach.\n\n4) The term \"language negotiation\" should be defined. Some readers may not know what it is, and even though it is a standard term in the industry some of the participants didn't think it was apt. It isn't really a negotiation since a request is made, and some response is given and end of story...\n\n5) para 2, bullets 1 & 2\nThe term \"strategy\" didn't seem appropriate. In bullet 1, consider \"convention\" instead. In bullet 2, \"strategy\" also indicated more policy-making than is required, when it is just identifying default values or responses.\nConsider something more along the lines of \"planning languages to be returned, when languages are requested that you don't support\".\n\n6) para 3\ndelete the word \"unfortunately\". It's ambiguous as to what is unfortunate, and it is not needed.\n\n7) para 4\nSplit the second sentence into 2 sentences.\nThe para should also say something to the effect: \"This faq describes only the Multiviews approach.\"\n\n8) The heading \"One possible approach\" should be \"Using Multiviews to configure Language Negotiation\", \"The Multviews Approach\", or some such.\n\n9) We suggest the default be something other than english.\n\n10) Section on File Naming\nShould other file types be considered besides html? (xml, css, jpg...)\n\n11) para 3,\n1st sentence refers to accessing the files when not on an apache server.\nPerhaps it should say when accessed directly, or when not accessing thru the network to the server. After all, even while being served, they can be accessed directly locally. Similarly, the next phrase should refer to \"accessing the resource via the apache server.\"\n\n12) Just curious, given the example, the multiviews must always refer to html. If there were 2 files example.jpg and example.html, the href without the extension would return the html?\n\n13) reference to rfc 3066 should also be in the links section.\n\n14) More generally, there should be many more links inline in the text, so people can reference immediately if they choose, and not have to look to the links section to see if there is a link there.\n\n15) The name of the file .htaccess is not optional is it? If it is mandatory, the sentence should not say \"typically be called\".\n\n16) Not discussed in the meeting, but I think the sentence recommending a default of English should be deleted. The widespread nature of english is irrelevant unless your page is directed for the public at large. The choice of default should reflect the makeup of your target audience and might very well be some other language. And english can't be a default if you haven't translated to english.\n\n17) specifying the default files 2.030 and above\nForceLanguagePriority does not specify the default, the prioritization of languages does. FLP suggests the methodology. Also, LanguagePriority is not specifying a particular file, but the language. The first sentence should be rewritten.\n\n18) Some text should explain the logic behind the example, as opposed to  stating the result.\nFLP allows a fallback method to be used, and the Lang.Pri. declares the ordering of possible choices. If a Spanish page doesnt exist, and if an English page does exist, then it will be served. If not, then a French page will be served. and so forth.\n(This is what we speculated the behavior to be. It needs confirmation.)\n\n19) section on default files in 1.3.4 and above\nThe heading should instead refer to versions 2.0.30 and below, or if we think there might be someone still using a version less than 1.3.4, than \"versions 1.3.4 to 2.0.30\".\n\n20) aha! I just read the BTW. Suggest mentioning that files other than html can be used, within the answer. With a section name like \"BTW\", idiots like me may not read it, as it sounds extraneous. However, the point about extensions is fundamental.\n\n21) Background\nFirst sentence would be slightly less ambiguous if it added \"user's\" to \" language preferences\". Also, perhaps use active voice to improve readability. e.g.\n\nUser agents provide information about the user's language preferences in the HTTP Accept-Language header of the request to a server for a document.\n(Also provide a link to accept-language header)\n\n22) Localisation, practise and other terms use British spelllings.\nWe were hoping Santa brought you an American spell-checker! ;-)\n\n23) There is a question of how to use the recommendation of .pl-pl.\nIs it:\naddlanguage pl .pl-pl\nLanguagePriorityen pl fr\n\ni.e. pl-pl is the extension, it gets assigned a language code, and then LanguagePriority uses language codes?\n\nPerhaps use polish throughout to make it clear.\n\n24) The link for rfc 1766 is wrong.\n\n25) Does the order of the statements in the .htaccess file make a difference? if so what is the preferred ordering? If not, state so.\n\n26) Does the .htaccess only apply to the current directory, or are subdirectories also affected? (I think subdirs are affected, unless they have their own .htaccess).\n\n\n27) The group felt that with the changes we recommended the faq could/should be published.\n\n\n\n"

We should also capture lessons learned.\nAction: MD, write short para for news item about w3c switching to utf-8.\n\nRuss also provided information about the Microsoft Global Development & Deployment Conference, in February.\n\n\nFAQ REVIEW\nMartin's FAQ was not yet ready.\n\n\n\nGUIDELINES REVIEWER'S COMMENTS\n\nJungshik Shin http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Oct/0020.html\nFont naming: Good point, add to guidelines.  Action: RR, check with Microsoft how non-ASCII font names are handled on XP.\nDate & time: The key point we should make is that ambiguity should be avoided. Which format is chosen to achieve that may depend on the circumstances.  ISO format may be useful in some cases, but in others a culturally adapted format might be better. In the latter case it is important to clearly establish which is month and year.\n\nBert Bos:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/2003OctDec/0009.html\n\n[0] Thanks !\n[1] Thanks again!\n[2] We will change it for next release.\n[4] We discussed whether it was appropriate to cover XHTML 1.1 in this document. Decided we should. We will add a note about no lang attribute in XHTML1.1.\n[5] First para: Thankyou for the correction.\nGeneral discussion followed about when to use before/after and start/end rather than left/right and top/bottom. We will need to understand the usage better in order to write the guidelines. There was some acceptance of the idea that localizers should expect to have to change stylesheets as part of the translation process. More discussion needed.\n\n\nNEW ACTIONS\n\nRR, check with Microsoft how non-ASCII font names are handled on XP\n\nMD, write short para for news item about w3c switching to utf-8\n\n\nACTIONS\n\nDC, TT, talk together to scope out new article on 'Unicode & bytes'\n\nRI, to talk with Ian Hickson about what he is developing\n\nDC, talk with RI about developing list of tests we could develop and capturing test results\nDONE\n\nRI, Dig out Martin's previous suggestions for Guidelines section on forms and suggest refinements\n\nMD, Write FAQ about what happens to characters entered in forms that are not in the encoding of the page; how does the charset attribute play into this (if at all); and x-uuencoded - what's that?\n\nLH, write up new version of his FAQs, incorporating comments for 26 Jan.\n\nac, write to public evangelist list about default charset declaration in Apache\n\nLloyd, write up some code samples relating to date formats and link to them from the Q&A page at a later date\n\nAll, send in pointers to existing guidelines \n\n\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ncontact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ \n\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/ \nhttp://www.w3.org/International/geo/ \n\nSee the W3C Internationalization FAQ page http://www.w3.org/International/questions.html\n\n\n\n"

            "subject": "RE: Meeting preread: Language declaration",
            "content": "Feedback is inline indicated by '>'. \n--------------------------------------------------\n\nQuestion\n\n\nShould I use HTTP Content-Language or a meta element to declare the language of my XHTML document?\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n[Read the background information]\n\nA distinction needs to be drawn between declaring the language of content and identifying the language(s) of the intended audience. It is recommended that the lang and xml:lang attributes be used for the former, and the HTTP Content-Language setting or a meta element be used, if appropriate or needed, for the latter.\n\n> In essence, it seems that you're recommending using both. I don't understand the distinction between 'language of content' and 'language(s) of the intended audience'.\n\n\nPrimary language\n\n\nThe discussion about pros and cons of attributes vs. meta elements or HTTP headers centers on information about the language of the document as a whole, ie. the primary language of the document. Note that a document with a primary language of, say, French may also contain fragments in other languages. To indicate the language of content for a fragment of a document there is no other choice but to use the lang and xml:lang attributes. \n\nIn very rare circumstances, a document may have more than one primary language. Here we are talking about documents that repeat the same or parallel content in more than one language, and where both linguistic parts have the same weight. This is rare on the Web because it is usually much easier to link to separate pages for each localized version.\n\n> I think the paragraph above makes a useful point, which you immediately consider when thinking about 'fragments' of different languages, ie what when that 'fragment' is of equivalent size to the rest.\n\n\nDeclaring the language of content\n\n\nWhen declaring the language of a specific range of content, there can and must only be one language specified, and that language information will be inherited by all subelements, unless a lower level element applies a different value.\n\nThe standard way to declare the language of a document is to use the lang and xml:lang attributes in the html tag. Since all other elements in the document are a subset of the html tag, they naturally inherit this value. Existing user agents currently recognize language values declared in this way when they come to apply language-specific styling, default fonts for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, etc.\n\n\nUse of the meta declaration\n\n\nA key issue with the use of the meta tag is that it is not obvious how it's value is inherited by elements throughout the document. In current practise browsers do not recognize the value in the meta declaration when processing the document.\n\n> Pedantic point: no apostrophe in 'its'.\n\nNote also that the meta declaration allows you to declare more than one language. In such a case the meta element could not be declaring the language of content, since a range of content can only be in one language at a time. On the other hand, if you are dealing with a document that has multiple primary languages, one could concieve of this information being useful for classification of the document or enabling easier recognition of document appropriateness when searching. In this case, however, the meta statement is still really indicating the intended audience of the document, rather than declaring the language of a range of content. (Note that this cannot be done using the lang and xml:lang attributes, since they support only one language value at a time.) The author is not aware of any standard way in which such information is used at the moment.\n\n\nUse of the HTTP Content-Language header\n\n\nThe HTTP Content-Language header could be used to declare the primary language of content, as long as only a single value was expressed. As soon as a list of languages is sent in the HTTP header this can no longer serve the same purpose. Note also that precedence rules mean that any declaration in the html tag overrides that in the HTTP header.\n\n> What is/was the purpose of allowing a list of languages to be specified in the HTTP header?\n\nIn addition, there are potential issues surrounding the maintenance and use of server-side information. Many authors may find it difficult to access server settings, particularly when dealing with an ISP. So this, unlike the html attribute approach, is not a solution that is always available.\n\nIt is for these reasons, and because the use of the html attributes is simple, standard and currently implemented in browsers, that the html attribute approach is recommended.. \n\n> I still don't really understand why we don't say 'do it if you can' *  and/or 'check what is being sent' (if you can't change, you can at least know & know what if any impact) and/or 'these are the sorts of questions for your ISP or webmaster/sys admin'.\n\n* CJKV (Ken Lunde, O'Reilly, Oct 2002) says \"Instead of arguing which method is best, why not simply support both methods whenever possible?\"\n\n\nBy the way\n\n\nNote that this discussion is very different from that about the use of the meta charset declaration and HTTP charset header. There is no alternative markup construct in XHTML for declaring the character encoding of a document, and the HTTP header takes precedence over the meta declaration.\n\n> I think the reasons why this is a very different discussion, could be usefully made clearer.\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n> These examples are useful, because I think many people may find it difficult to talk abstractly about where language information is specified, but they can recognize the examples.\n\nIn current practise one can find XHTML documents that provide information about the language of a page in a number of different ways. \n\nOne method is to use the lang and xml:lang attributes on the html tag.\n\nExample:\n<html lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n\nAlternatively, you may find documents that provide this information using a meta element.\n\nExample:\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"en\"/>\n\nLanguage information may also be found in the HTTP header that is sent with a document (see the last line in the following example of an HTTP header).\n\n> Could a useful FAQ be: How do I view an HTTP header and what information does it contain about language? \n\nExample:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 05 Nov 2003 10:46:04 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.28 (Unix) PHP/4.2.3\nContent-Location: CSS2-REC.en.html\nVary: negotiate,accept-language,accept-charset\nTCN: choice\nP3P: policyref=http://www.w3.org/2001/05/P3P/p3p.xml\nCache-Control: max-age=21600\nExpires: Wed, 05 Nov 2003 16:46:04 GMT\nLast-Modified: Tue, 12 May 1998 22:18:49 GMT\nETag: \"3558cac9;36f99e2b\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 10734\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\nContent-Language: en\n\nIt is also worth noting that the meta element and the HTTP header support a list of values. The example below declares the primary languages of the document to be (in equal measure) German, French and Italian.\n\nExample:\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"de, fr, it\"/>\n\nThe question is, which of these methods is the best approach?

For me, \"primary\" means first \nof all or first choice. So there couldn't be more than one.

            "content": "On Friday I added some info to http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html#IDANKKO about representing characters using escapes.  This is still a work in progress.\n\nSplitting the basic techniques document into parts meant that we were no longer able to simply run some xslt on one file to create the overview.  This created what I initially thought was a dilemma, then an opportunity wrt the Outline doc.  Over the weekend I started from scratch on this doc again, with I think a better result.  You can see the result so far at http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/outline/html-authoring-outline.html .  \n\nRather than generate the doc from the existing structure, I have created it from a separate view template. This takes us back in the direction of the 'repository' plus 'view' approach we had before, but with a significant difference.  The 'repositories' are now the documents heading for Note status.  The 'view' is the outline document.\n\nThe fact that the view is derived from a handcrafted template enables us to address navigation around all the techniques independently from the organisation they get in the Notes - which I think will prove to be extremely useful.  We can provide headings for the Notes that provide a cogent grouping of information for those who want to read all the detail in one go.  The outline doc (or should we call it 'overview' or 'index' now?) can be fine-tuned for guiding people to the right information along task oriented lines, and doesn't really need to have the same organisation as the Notes at all.  (As it happens, they are currently still very close, though we ought to do some usability testing around that.)\n\nThe importance of the outline doc is also greater now that we have split information into separate notes.  It really is the starting point now for the HTML/XHTML Authoring Techniques - which I think is good.\n\nNote one useful innovation: You can link from the outline to the detail by clicking on a specific technique text, rather than at the section level. Given the current organisation, however, you can't link back to the outline doc from the Note.  I think this is fine. (Note also that I still have to write the xslt for the resources-only view we used to have.)\n\nOne question in my mind is how to deal with the table of contents for the outline doc.  We previously had an expanding table of contents at the top.  We could do the same, or we could create a higher level page that was only a toc (though we can keep something in the current outline doc like we have currently).  The benefit of this approach would be to reduce complexity on the page and clearly simulate the 'drill down' approach we are employing for task oriented location of info. In that context, the additional clicks are not such an issue - in fact, it would be more additional pages than additional clicks, anyway.  Thoughts?\n\nNote also that I have added some additional columns to the right - though the data is just replicated twice. (We need to start making it correct.)\n\nStill some way to go, but I like what I'm seeing here.  I also like the smaller techniques notes files - they feel much more manageable.\n\nRI\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ncontact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/ \n\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/ \nhttp://www.w3.org/International/geo/ \n\n\n\n"

On the other hand, IANA tags are deprecated\nas new codes are added to the ISO standard. Deprecated IANA tags include\nno-bok (Norwegian \"Book language\" - use ISO 639 nb), i-navajo\n(Navajo - use ISO 639 nv), i-lux (Luxembourgish - use ISO 639 lb),\nand others. For this reason, IANA registration should only be seen\nas a temporary fix in the absence of ISO codes.\n\n\nI think the following should be changed:\n\n\"IANA tags are deprecated as new codes are added to the ISO standard.\"\n->\n\"IANA tags have been deprecated when corresponding codes were added to\nthe ISO standard.\"\n\nI don't think the following is appropriate:\n\"IANA registration should only be seen as a temporary fix in the\nabsence of ISO codes.\"\nThere are IANA codes that will probably last quite long, others not.\nThis is difficult to predict. I think something like \"If you use\nIANA-registered tags, please be aware that they may be deprecated\nsome time in the future in case a corresponding ISO code is registered.\"\nOr because this is already said earlier, just leave this sentence out.\n\nSome other comments:\n\n\"email submission process\": I think this might create the wrong\nimpression that you can just submit proposals by email.\n\nI would also make the distinction between i- tags and other\nregistered tags clearer, e.g. like this:\nIANA registered tags can be of two forms: Primary languages\n(in which case the tag is started with i- to avoid confusion\nwith ...) and sublanguages.\n\n\nRegards,   Martin.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "MINUTES\nW3C I18N GEO F2F\nTechnical Plenary, Cannes, 1-5 March 2004\nAttendees: Martin D??rst, Najib Tounsi, Richard Ishida (Chair I18N GEO), Tex Texin \nDeborah Cawkwell, Addison Philipps\nObservers: Ann Bassetti, Nicolas Duboc\n \nDELIVERABLES FOR END OF CURRENT CHARTER\n\nDiscussion about WHAT to Deliver\n- The Charter (http://www.w3.org/2002/05/i18n-recharter/WG-charter.html#geo).\n- Decision to extract from Techniques, the four complete sections and present separately as Notes; these include the key areas of character encoding, bi-di and language identification. These have now been published as editor???s drafts and are linked from the http://www.w3.org/International/geo/ page. John Yunker had also shown an interest in working on navigation ??? Richard to check on progress.\n- Decision to deliver extracted sections as Notes, rather than web pages. Notes require top-heavy process (W3C stuff, etc), but this information adds weight.\n- Identification of additional sections which were important or near enough completion to be ready for August: forms, XForms.\n- Retention of Techniques structure as a 'roadmap' with links to completed Notes.\n- We will maintain the full list of desirable topics in a separate location. Richard has done some work on this; a little more work needs to be done.\n- Lose 3.4 Specifying the encoding of a link destination. \n- Keep 6.8 Enabling mirroring of layout. \n- How to refer to the FAQs - use a paragaraph to explain that the FAQs have informed the Techniques documents.\n\nDiscussion about HOW to work on the Deliverables for the End of the Charter\n- The focus of work must be on the deliverables, ie the Guideline Notes. However, if people felt more comfortable producing FAQs, Richard could incorporate that information into the Guideline Notes or the FAQ author could additionally prepare Guideline Notes work themselves.\n- Although the focus of work must be on the Guideline Notes, the FAQs and tutorials are a helpful/effective way of amassing content for the Techniques and valuable in their own right. Sometimes one had been produced per week, but they had occupied most of the attention of the group. Would it be helpful to assign a reviewer as well as a writer to each FAQ? The FAQs could feed into the Guideline Notes, especially if that would be a way of producing more information. \n- There was a suggestion to 'divide and conquer' by allocating some people to Guideline Notes and others to FAQs, but it was felt that a lot was gained by group input into each and that, in some ways, division dilutes.\n- Richard emphasised the importance of committing to work and delivering on deadline. Richard had produced a plan of work organised by importance (http://www.w3.org/International/2003/plan.html), which would aid meeting preparation, rather than solely relying on the agenda. 'For Final Review' must be read for the meeting; 'For Early Review' should be read if there's enough time. (Addison: similar problems with the Web Services task force. Now sending people specific assignments. It was important to make small-enough, granular tasks that people could accomplish alongside their day jobs.\n\nDiscussion about GEO output\n- How should tutorials, Techniques & FAQs work together?\n- Some confusion around the difference between tutorials & technique notes:\n - Tutorial: defined around slide sets\n - Techniques: what are all the things I should do\n - FAQ answers a question\n - Articles everything else\n- Suggestion that it might be useful to state the function of the different documents on the web site.\n- An FAQ needs to be very tight with a strong focus on the question - could also be a short article.  \n- Tex: Could be more task-orientated.\n- Glossary to be added culling terms used in current work. Tex to start pulling the glossary together, Richard to search current tutorials and guidelines fro the initial batch of words.\n- Articles from people outside the GEO group. Was it decided that this should be encouraged and if so, how?\n- Dynamic web site features. (More about this?)\n \nCHARTER RENEWAL - DISCUSSION RE GEO ACTIVITIES FOR NEXT TWO YEARS\n(Current charter: http://www.w3.org/2002/05/i18n-recharter/WG-charter.html#geo)\nLocalisation\n- Locale model where the goal was to make localisation a black box. \n- There is little information on cultural design issues; metaphors and gestures are not culturally neutral; calendar: week starts on different day; time & date; division of the day (eg, in Thailand the day is divided into four part). Some localisation issues are more difficult to pin down: colours, how much information on the screen, navigation location in some Asian. Localisation can complicate re-purposing. \n- There is are UI localisation issues such as scroll bar location. Should this be a language issue, as it currently seems to be, or an accessibility issue, ie, depending on left- or right-handedness (cf, is there a distinction between left and right click?). Should this depend on the user agent set-up or the page set-up? Should the group have an opinion or was this outside GEO's remit? \n\nI18N Architecture\n- Architecture for I18N: making I18N core to the build, rather than adding as an extra layer, eg, style sheet structure, bold mark-up.\n- This could mean going back and making changes in your architecture.\n\nSupport For I18N In Programming Languages\n- I18N in programming languages (keg, Perl, JSP) / applications used to automate site-building as a long-term goal. Richard expressed concerns that the scope was to large.\n\nCollaboration\n- Within I18N Activity groups: GEO should work closely with Core and Web Services I18N groups with the new Charter, especially given for the Core the large block of work represented by the Character Model would be finished by new Charter.\n- Across other W3C Groups: Increase collaboration with other W3C Groups. Currently I18N DTD is shared with WAI group. Richard recently inputted to QA group. I18N GEO to co-ordinate with CSS group on test suite.\n\nIncrease The Size/Resource of I18N GEO Group\n- Recruit more people. Could the type of work encourage more GEO members, eg, localisation for Boeing; I18N support in programming languages?\n\nEducation\n- Should more work be done in this area?\n- Need to think about how education & outreach materials should grow: work out scope and structure.\n\nDeliverable\n- Must be deliverable, not too 'blue sky'.\n \nTUTORIAL: CHARACTER SETS & ENCODINGS IN XHTML, HTML AND CSS\n(http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html)\n\nUnicode Knowledge Pre-requisite\n- Does knowledge of Unicode need to be an assumption in the use of the document. Many I18N sites do not use Unicode. However, it would be useful to emphasise the benefits of Unicode for I18N.\n\nGlossary\n- Addition of glossary. Text to cull FAQs (only?). Richard: to find all terms in document and point to where they are used. Tex to provide 'use case': definition.\n\nHTML Character Entities, Numerical Character References (NCRs)\n- The recommendation is not to use. Deborah thought it useful add clarification about why the use of HTML character entities seemed to have been recommended in the past (portability) and why it was no longer a recommendation. (Otherwise this may seem to content developers like a difference in opinion, rather than clear advice.)\n- Clarification about where HTML character entities and NCRs are useful, eg, within attributes, &quot;.\n- Choice of NCRs over character entities, eg, HTML character entities are mnemonic; NCRs are not.\nHex vs decimal, examples of both, reference to use in Unicode standard of hexadecimal. \n\nQuirks section to be cloned, so that it will remain in the tutorial, but another instance will be created. \n\nOutcome\n- Publish with what we've discussed today. Action Richard.\n- Tex: holding page for comments. (Is there an action on this?)\n \nTUTORIAL: USING LANGUAGE INFORMATION IN XHTML, HTML AND CSS\n(http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-lang.html)\n\nLanguage tag ('lang')\n- Are the examples distinct enough, showing that glyphs used vary in small details.\n- Bullet point benefits, eg, for text readers, search.\n- Simplify text, eg, not 'style-generated', not 'ideographic code points'.\n- Add elements where 'lang' tag cannot be used.\n- Not 'lists codes' but 'defines', because it is a standard.\n- *a* few not 'few'\n- look again at use of ';'\n\nSub codes\n- Applies only to first code, not to second one. (Not quite sure what this means.)\n\nUNRESOLVED QUESTIONS \n- Would it be helpful to assign a reviewer as well as a writer to each FAQ? \n\nACTIONS\nRI: check with John Yunker re navigation document for Techniques.\nRI: extract completed sections and present as Working Drafts. DONE\nRI: full list of desirable topics in a separate location (to that of pointers to Notes). A little more work required.\nTT: to start pulling the glossary together.\nRI: to search current tutorials and guidelines fro the initial batch of words.TT: provide 'use case': definition (glossary).\nDC, RI: meet with Ian Hickson (CSS Group & Opera) re test suite collaboration.  DONE\nAll: read 'Language markup in XHTML and CSS'.\nAll: use the Plan document to prepare for each weekly meeting.\nRI: state the function of the different documents on the web site?\nRI: incorporate Tutorial Review comments.\nAll: re-read Charter (http://www.w3.org/2002/05/i18n-recharter/WG-charter.html#geo).\nAll: read TAG document (http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/).\nRI: Quirks section to be cloned.

            "content": "Questions for GEO\n- Is the new structure an improvement? (The old one was a while ago, so you may not remember...)\n- Can you help with any square-bracket questions?\n- Please email comments, etc, before the next meeting, so that I can incorporate them before then.\nThanks in advance.\nDeborah\n--------------------------------\nQUESTION\nWhy should I use the 'lang' attribute?\nThe 'lang' attribute contains information about the language(s) used in the web page.\nThe 'lang' attribute should be used to indicate the main language of the web page; it should also be used to indicate any change of language within the text.\n\nANSWER\nThe 'lang' attribute is required for accessibility and it is becoming increasingly important and useful for rendering the page as appropriate for language and locale.\nIn addition, the 'lang' attribute is useful for search engines, spelling/grammar checkers, XML [what kind of tasks?]. \nUsing the 'lang' attribute will help to future-proof your web pages. \nThe 'lang' attribute will improve the user experience for those using the web in a language other than English.\nImplementing the 'lang' attribute is easy (http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html).\nAccessibility\nThe 'lang' attribute assists speech synthesizers and Braille translators; it is required by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and enforced governmental policies in some countries, eg, UK - Disability Discrimination Act (UK) [other countries? contact WAI? and/or specifically request this information from users - useful way to get people more involved?] \nPage rendering\nCSS2 uses the 'lang' attribute powerfully as a pseudo class.  (http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang.html).\nUnfortunately it doesn't work in IE yet.  But the concept of language specific styling is a very powerful one. [Need to add some examples.]\nSearch\nA common use for meta is to specify keywords that a search engine may use to improve the quality of search results. When several meta elements provide language-dependent information about a document, search engines may filter on the xml:lang attribute to display search results using the language preferences of the user. (http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20020805/mod-meta.html)\nXML\nThe 'xml:lang' attribute is the standard way to identify language information in XML.

            "content": "This is rough at the moment.\nBelow is initial UTF-8 BOM material, that was reduced to have more of a\nfocus on the question. I'd like to re-use the byte stuff (mostly nearer\nthe bottom).\nI think this would be a useful article, because I don't think it's\nexplained simply in one place. Also, it's crucial to the I18N and as\nsuch, should be \nGEO-ed.\n \n---------------------------\n \nNEW ARTICLE: CHARACTER ENCODING AND BYTES\n \nAREAS TO COVER\n \n- How it works without Unicode in terms of bytes\n- Unicode encoding's use of multiple bytes and how that varies across\ndifferent bytes.\n- Implications, eg, 'heavier' character representation.\n \n---------------------------\n \nWHAT IS THE UNICODE BOM (BYTE ORDER MARK)?\n \nThe encoded Unicode Scalar Value (unique reference to a character\ndefined within the Unicode repertoire) corresponding to the Unicode\ncharacter \"Zero Width \nNon-Breaking Space\", whose sequence of byte-values is judged to be\nunlikely to occur at the beginning of any 'normal' text file. \n \nA Unicode BOM has two purposes:\n            - for UTF-16/32, it indicates the order in which bytes\nshould be interpreted (big Endian/little Endian), since the 'unit of\nencoding' is greater than \none byte for both of these encodings, unlike UTF-8; this is the primary\npurpose of a BOM.\n            - to identify a plain text file as containing Unicode text;\nthis is a secondary 'purpose'.\n            \n            \nWHERE DOES IT OCCUR WITHIN BBC WS NEW MEDIA?\n \nIn Notepad files used to create HTML files/Apache includes, when saving\nas UTF-8.\n \nIn BBC World Service New Media, we came across the BOM when working with\nlanguages, which, for the web, required to be encoded in UTF-8 (we\ncurrently use \nUTF-8 only when there is no other alternative); those languages are\nHindi, Pashto, Persian, Urdu, Vietnamese). For those languages, our\ncurrent process is to \nrequest translations of 'furniture' vocabulary, such as navigation\nwords, 'Latest News', etc. These translations are supplied from the BBC\nLanguage Services \nin MS Word. \n            - We create HTML navigational includes using MS Notepad.\n            - We create language service configuration files for use in\nXSL processing.\n            \n            \nPROBLEMS\n \nIn MS Notepad, the Unicode BOM does not appear on-screen when editing\nthe file; however, once uploaded and viewed via the web, the BOM appears\nas a space \nabove the included text. In the case of UTF-8, it appears to serve no\npurpose. In order to remove the extraneous space, the file is opened in\nMacromedia \nHomesite, where the BOM appears as 3 characters, which are deleted\n(corresponding the values EF BB BF, which is the UTF-8 encoding for the\nU+FFEF Zero Width \nNon-Breaking Space Unicode character used for the BOM). It would seem\nthat the second above-identified purpose of the Unicode BOM is\nsuperfluous; the first \nabove-identified purpose is irrelevant to UTF-8 anyway.\n \n \nMISUNDERSTANDINGS\n \nI had thought that the different encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32) of\nthe Unicode character repertoire, represented different (sub)sets of\nthat repertoire. I \nhad thought that any UTF-8 encoding carried double the weight of the\npresented text (as opposed to the mark-up of that presented text).\n \nTo understand the Unicode BOM I had to understand the following...\n \n \nSO WHY ARE THERE THREE DIFFERENT UNICODE ENCODINGS, IF THEY CAN ALL\nREPRESENT THE SAME (UNIVERSAL) CHARACTER REPERTOIRE?\n \nThe 3 different Unicode encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. Each\nencoding can refer to each and every value in the Unicode repertoire.\nThe choice of \nUnicode encoding depends on language and efficiency. \n \n \nHOW DOES THE UNICODE BOM EFFECT EACH ENCODING?\n \nThe Unicode BOM primarily indicates the order in which byte(s) should be\n'translated' into the corresponding Unicode Scalar Value. \n \nTo understand, it is important to understand that:\n \n            In regard to the the Unicode encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16,\nUTF-32):\n \n                        - UTF-8 is encoded using 1-4 bytes. In UTF-8,\nthe smallest indivisable unit of meaning is 1 byte. That byte either\nrepresents a given Scalar \nValue in the Unicode repertoire or indicates that a Scalar Value cannot\nbe obtained with only 1 byte and the system needs to look at subsequent\nbytes.\n                        \n                        Unicode character\nUTF-8 byte 1     UTF-8 byte 2     UTF-8 byte 3     UTF-8 byte 4\n                        \n                        0000 to 007F (ASCII)\n01xxxxxx\n                        0080 to 07FF\n110xxxxx                                  10xxxxxx\n                        0800 to FFFF\n1110xxxx                                  10xxxxxx\n10xxxxxx\n                        10000 to 10FFFF\n11110xxx                                  10xxxxxx\n10xxxxxx                                  \n10xxxxxx\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                        , where the first byte indicates how many\nfurther bytes have been used to encode the given Scalar Value in the\nUnicode repertoire for the \ncharacter being encoded. \n                        \n                        The bytes can be seen as discrete in that the\nfirst byte indicates how many (if any) further bytes are required to\nidentify the Unicode \nScalar Value. \n                        \n                        \n                        The values in the Unicode repertoire from 0-127\nrepresent the ASCII (non-extended set). As 'low' values, these can be\nrepresented in a single \nbyte.\n \n                        - UTF-16 is encoded using 2 or 4 bytes (mostly\n2). Where 4 bytes are required to represent a value in the Unicode\nrepertoire at the higher \nend, the first 2 bytes use a reserved value to indicate that a 2nd 2\nbytes are required to identify the Unicode Scalar Value.\n \n                        - UTF-32 is always encoded using 4 bytes.\n            \n            Where there are encodings which require more than 1 byte\n(eg, UTF-16, UTF-32), a system may read those bytes from 'least\nsignificant numerical value \nto most significant numerical value' or 'most significant numerical\nvalue to least significant numerical value' depending on whether it is\n'little endian' or \n'big endian' respectively.\n            \n            To illustrate this, take the decimal number 'twenty-five'.\nWritten conventionally in decimal format, this becomes '25', that is to\nsay, the digit '2' \nfollowed by the digit '5'.  In this example, the '2' is most significant\nbecause it represents the value 'twenty' or 'two times ten', and '5' is\nthe least \nsignificant because it represents the value 'five' or 'five ones'. We\ncould write a representation of the same value as '52' if we adopted a\nconvention \nwhereby the 'least significant' preceded 'more significant' values when\nwritten out ('serialized'), but if we allow this alternative\nrepresentation, we need \nsome means of specifying which representation has been used.\n            \n            In the case of Unicode, the receiving system uses the\nUnicode BOM and its encoding in UTF-8/16/32 to understand 'direction'.\nThus, the encoded \nrepresentation of the BOM indicates the direction in which the remaining\nbytes should be interpreted. Little endian serializes from the least\nsignificant \n(number), whereas big endian serializes from the most significant\nnumber.\n            \n                        - big or little endian is dependent on the\nprocessor architecure:\n                                    - Motorola, PowerPC = big endian\n                                    - Intel = little endian\n            \n                        - little endian - reads byte\n            \n                        - big endian - reads bytes right-to-left\n            \n            \n \n \n \nUTF-8 is a byte-stream (code-size = one byte), hence byte-ordering is\nirrelevant; each byte is 'atomic' in itself, and does not require to be\npaired with \nanother to derive a 'meaningful' unit of information (this does not mean\nthat a single byte can encode any character, merely that relevant\ninformation can be \nderived from a single byte, whereas a single byte of data whose\n'code-size' is 2 bytes is essentially 'meaningless').\n \nHowever, as the 'code size' of UTF-16/32 is greater than one byte (eg 2\nor 4 bytes), given the fact that different architectures store/serialize\nsuch \nsequences in memory/on disk either 'most-significant-byte-first' or\n'least-significant-byte-first', byte-order is significant (eg\nlittle-endian vs \nbig-endian), and some means of identifying the byte-order is essential\nif byte-sequences serialized on one machine are to be interpreted\ncorrectly on \nanother.\n \nThe Unicode standard does not impose a specific byte-ordering sequence,\non the basis that machines function most efficiently when able to\noperate using their \n'native' serialization order, hence some means of identifying same is\nrequired.\n \nThis is the primary function of the BOM.  Unicode uses the U+FFEF Zero\nWidth Non-Breaking Space (ZWNBSP) Unicode character at the beginning of\na file as its \nbyte-order mark; thus when interpreting UTF-16/32, if an application\nexecuting on a 'big endian' machine 'sees' the value FFEF in the first\ntwo/four bytes of \na file, it is able to infer that the incoming data is UTF-16/UTF-32 'big\nendian, whereas if it 'sees' the value FEFF (which is not a valid\nUnicode Scalar \nValue) it is able to infer that that the incoming data is UTF-16/32\n'little endian'.\n \nUTF-8 is a variable length encoding - characters corresponding to the\nASCII range are encoded using one byte, the Unicode Scalar Values\ncorresponding exactly \nthe equivalent ASCII values.\n \nCharacters whose Unicode Scalar Value is > 127 (decimal) are encoded\nusing two to four bytes.  The most significant bits of the first byte of\nsuch \ncharacters' byte sequences will be 110xxxxx, for characters encoded with\ntwo bytes, 1110xxxx for characters encoded with three byte, and 11110xxx\nfor those \nencoded with four bytes.  The most significant bits of the second, third\nand fourth bytes will always be 10xxxxxx.\n \nThese bit 'patterns' allow a 'UTF-8-savvy' application to distinguish\ncharacters encoded with a single byte from those encoded with multiple\nbytes, since the \nthe most significant bits of the first byte indicates how many bytes\nhave been used to encode any character.  A side effect of this use of\nbit positions to \nsignify encoding size, is that while 4 bytes can theoretically encode\n4,294,967,296 different characters, only 2,164,863 variations are\npossible in UTF-8, \nmost of which are not defined by the Unicode repetoire anyway.\n \nExamples:\n \nUnicode character                                              UTF-8\nbyte 1     UTF-8 byte 2     UTF-8 byte 3     UTF-8 byte 4\n \n0000 to 007F (ASCII)                              01xxxxxx\n0080 to 07FF\n110xxxxx                                  10xxxxxx\n0800 to FFFF                                                    1110xxxx\n10xxxxxx                                  10xxxxxx\n10000 to 10FFFF                                               11110xxx\n10xxxxxx                                  10xxxxxx\n10xxxxxx\n \n \nREFERENCES\n \nhttp://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N7702.html#d8771e16\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/un\nicode_42jv.asp\nUnicode: A Primer, Tony Graham, M&T Books (IDG Books Worldwide), 2000\n(http://www.mulberrytech.com/unicode/primer/)\n \n \nOTHER FAQS\n \nWhich languages fall at the end of the Unicode repertoire requiring 4\nbytes?\nDoes Unicode mean heavier pages?\nWhat a user needs to receive Unicode?\nUsing applications & OS with languages.\n \nDeborah Cawkwell\nSenior Software Engineer \nBBC World Service New Media\n707 NE Bush House\nLondon\nWC2 4PH\nTel: 0207 557 3763\nFax: 0207 836 4332\ndeborah.cawkwell@bbc.co.uk\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice \n \n\nBBCi at http://www.bbc.co.uk/\n\nThis e-mail (and any attachments) is confidential and may contain\npersonal views which are not the views of the BBC unless specifically\nstated.\nIf you have received it in error, please delete it from your system. \nDo not use, copy or disclose the information in any way nor act in\nreliance on it and notify the sender immediately.

It's a bit longer than I \nanticipated and pretty much just FYI, but please go on \nif you are interested in.\n\nAccording to GENGOU O ARATAMERU SEIREI (Government ordinance \nto change the name of era) issued on January 7th, 1999, \nSHOWA era ends on January 7th, 1999 (or SHOWA 64), and \nHEISEI era starts on January 8th, 1999.  There is no \nover-wrap on dates between SHOWA and HEISEI.\n\nAccording to SHOWA KAIGEN NO SHOUSHO (Imperial edict to \nchange the name of era SHOWA) issued on December 25th, \n1926, TAISHOU era ends on December 25th, 1926 (or TAISHOU \n15), and SHOWA era starts on December 25th, 1926.  Because \nof the language used in the edict, it's a bit confusing \nwhether December 25th is included or excluded in SHOWA.  \nThe word \"IGO\" can be interpreted as \"after\" or \"from\", \nand it's making unclear whether SHOWA starts after December \n25th or on December 25th.  Although, it's clear December \n25th, TAISHOU 15 does exist.\n\nAccording to TAISHOU KAIGEN NO SHOUSHO (Imperial edict to \nchange the name of era TAISHOU) issued on July 30th, 1912, \nMEIJI era ends on July 30th, 1912 (or MEIJI 45), and \nTAISHOU era starts on July 30th, 1912.  Because of the \nlanguage used in the edict just like the one for SHOWA, \nit's not very clear whether TAISHOU starts after July \n30th or on July 30th.  It's clear July 30th, MEIJI 45 \ndoes exist.\n\nAccording to MEIJI KAIGEN NO FUKOKU (Declaration of \nchanging the name of era MEIJI) issued on September \n8th, 1868, KEIO era ends in 1868 (or KEIO 4).  Up until \nthis, these are to specify the name of the year, and \nthere is no concept to start one era at a certain date \nof year.  It means the first year of MEIJI era entirely \nover-wraps with the last year of KEIO (or KEIO 4).\n\nThe first year of each era is always referred as GANNEN, \nmeaning the first year of era.  For instance, the first \nyear of HEISEI is called HEISEI GANNEN, instead of HEISEI \n1.  The year number 1 is never used to indicate the first \nyear of era.\n\nHere is the summary:\n\n1868: End of KEIO era (KEIO 4)\n      Beginning of MEIJI era\n1912 Jul 30th: End of MEIJI era (MEIJI 45)\n     Jul 30th: Beginning of TAISHOU era\n1926 Dec 25th: End of TAIISHOU era (TAISHOU 15)\n     Dec 25th: Beginning of SHOWA era\n1999 Jan 7th: End of SHOWA era (Showa 64)\n     Jan 8th: Beginning of HEISEI era\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n"

Phillips\nDirector, Globalization Architecture\nwebMethods, Inc. \n----------------------------------------\nInternationalization is an architecture. \nIt is not a feature. \n\nChair, W3C-I18N-WG Web Services Task Force\nTo participate see http://www.w3.org/International/ws \n---------------\nDear XMLP Editors,\n\nSome time ago I worked with our XMLP rep, Asir, to produce a rewrite of SOAP 1.2 Part 2 Appendix B [1]. This is issue #270 [2] on your issues list. More recently I became the chair of the I18N-WG's Web Services task force, which has been delegated the review of Web Services recommendations, etc., by the I18N-WG Core group. At our recent face-to-face we reviewed the various i18n issues in SOAP 1.2 to ensure that we understood the actions taken by XMLP/SOAP WG and that we had no further comments.\n\nOne of the issues our task force reviewed was Appendix B. As I remarked in our last exchange (see the bottom of this email for a refresher), the text was pretty hard to read and very difficult to understand. The I18N-WG resolved therefore to prepare an improved version, which is included in this message between the ---- lines.\n\nThis version is functionally identical to the previous version. However, it should be easier to understand and therefore correctly implement. Would you please incorporate this version into SOAP 1.2 Part 2 in place of the current version?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\n/s\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part2.html#namemap\n[2] http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/xmlp-lc-issues.html#x270\n\n----------------\n\nB. Mapping Application Defined Names to XML Names\n\nThis appendix details an algorithm for taking an application defined name, such as the name of a variable or field in a programming language, and mapping it to the Unicode characters that are legal in the names of XML elements and attributes as defined in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nNote: Application defined names are generally subject to the specific restrictions of their underlying development environment. Ideally these names should restricted to the subset of Unicode characters in accordance with the guidelines in Unicode Standard Annex #15, Annex 7 (\"Programming Language Identifiers\")[1]. Names that follow these guidelines will generally also follow the guidelines in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nHex Digits\n\n[5]    hexDigit    ::=    [0-9A-F]\n* Note, only uppercase letters A-F are defined here.\n\nB.1 Rules for mapping application defined names to XML Names\n\n1. An XML Name has two parts: Prefix and LocalPart. Let Prefix be determined per the rules and constraints specified in Namespaces in XML [3]. The LocalPart will be determined by transforming the application name of the object as follows.\n\n2. Let \"T\" be the application name. \"T\" must be represented by a sequence of Unicode characters in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) [2]. Let \"M\" be the output of this algorithm, also as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n\nNote: If the name in the application is represented in some non-Unicode character encoding, it must be converted to Unicode before starting the name mapping process. Ideally any such conversion will use a reversable conversion (so that the original byte sequence can be obtained from the Unicode sequence), although this is not possible for some encodings.\n\nNote: Characters in the application name's original encoding that do not have a mapping to Unicode should be handled in some reasonable, application defined manner.\n\nNote: \"A sequence of Unicode characters\" means a sequence of code points (sometimes called Unicode Scalar Values). This should not be taken to imply that the characters are using any particular encoding of Unicode. The conversion algorithm itself may use whatever Unicode encoding is most convenient on that platform. However, it is important to note that surrogate pair sequences (pairs of UTF-16 code points that represent characters in Unicode above U+FFFF) must be handled as a single Unicode code point (their Scalar Value, that is the specific supplemental character they represent), rather than as the individual bytes or surrogate characters in UTF-16. Unpaired surrogates are not permitted. For example:\n\nThe UTF-16 sequence 0xD800 0xDC00 represents the Unicode character U+10000. When performing the following steps, the value U+10000 is considered to be a single Unicode character in the sequence T.\n\n3. Let \"i\" be an integer representing the current position in \"T\", T(i), with a starting value of 1, such that T(1) is the first character in T, T(2) is the second, and so forth. Let \"n\" represent the last position in T, T(n).\n\n4. Starting with 1, iterate across T by increasing i by 1 and perform the following evaluation on each character. \n\n   a. If T begins with the string \"xml\" (or any upper/lower case variation, such as \"xmL\", \"XML\", or \"xMl\"), encode T(1) using rule 4.c.i (that is, output either \"_x0078_\" for \"x\" or \"_x0058_\" for \"X\") and increase \"i\" to 4.\n\n   Note: if the sequence starts with \"xml\"/\"XML\"/\"xMl\"/etc., and is followed by a Unicode combining character, the combining character is not considered part of the letter \"l\" for processing purposes. By contrast, precomposed characters such as U+013B (Latin letter capital L with cedilla) do not trigger this rule. That is \"xm??\" is encoded as xm??, whereas xml(U+0300) is encoded as _x0078_ml_x0300_. [Note that Normalization Form C means that this special case will always produce the same resulting sequence.]\n\n   b. If T(i) falls in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF (that is, there is an unpaired surrogate character in the sequence), stop with an error.\n\n   c. Else if T(i) is not a valid XML NCName character (see [3]) or if i=1 and T(i) is not a valid first character of an XML NCName (see [3]) then:\n\n      i. If T(i) < U+10000 and T(i) is not in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by four hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value followed by an underscore (\"_\") (for example, \"x\" (U+0078) would be encoded as \"_x0078_\").\n\n      ii. Else if T(i) > U+FFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by eight hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value. For example, the character 0x10FFFE would be encoded as \"_x0010FFFE_\".\n\n   d. Else if T(i) = \"_\" (lowline) and T(i+1) = \"x\" or \"X\", output \"_x005F_\" to M.\n\n   e. Else output T(i) to M.\n\n[1] http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/#Programming_Language_Identifiers\n[2] http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/\n[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nHello world -> Hello_x0020_world  // space not permitted\nHello_xorld -> Hello_x005F_xorld  // _x rule\nHelloworld_ -> Helloworld_        \n\n          x -> x\n        xml -> _x0078_ml   // starts with xml\n       -xml -> _x002D_xml  // starts with hyphen-minus\n       x-ml -> x-ml        // not the string xml\n\n     ??lfred -> ??lfred\n   ???????????????? -> ????????????????\n????????????        -> _x1709__x1705__x170E__x1708_   // the Tagalog block is newer and not permitted in XML 1.0\n?????????         -> _x13D9__x13DA__x13A5_  // The Cherokee block is newer and not permitted in XML 1.0\n\nxml??moo -> _x0078_ml_x0300_moo  // Starts with \"xml\".

I have modified Kentaroh's text slightly and added several blocks designed to allay the (legitimate) concerns of the various WS working groups.\n\nKentaroh: could you please incorporate these changes? Others: please send comments to the list for discussion.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n-------\n1 Introduction\n\nThis document specifies a variety of Web Services internationalization usage scenarios and use cases.\n\nThe goal of the Web Services Internationalization Task Force is to ensure that Web Services have robust support for global use, including all of the world's languages and cultures. \n\nThe goal of this document is to examine the different ways that language, culture, and related issues interact with Web Services architectures and technology. Ultimately this will allow us to develop standards and best practices for those interested in implementing internationalized Web Services. We may also discover latent international considerations in the various Web Services standards and propose solutions to the responsible groups working in these areas.\n\nWeb Services provide a world-wide distributed environment that uses XML based messaging to provide access to distributed objects, application integration, data/information exchange, presentation aggregation, and other rich machine-to-machine interaction. The global reach of the Internet requires support for the international creation, publication and discovery of Web Services. Although the technologies and protocols used in Web Services (such as HTTP, XML, XML Schema, and so forth) are generally quite mature as \"international-ready\" technologies, Web Services may require additional perspective in order to provide the best internationalized performance, because they represent a way of accessing distributed logic via a URI.\n\nAs a result, this document attempts to describe the different scenarios in which international use of Web Services may require care on the part of the implementer or user or to demonstrate potential issues with Web Services technology.\n\nThis document describes the following kinds of usage scenarios:\n\n   1. Locale neutral vs. locale-sensitive XML messages and data exchange\n   2. Interaction between Web services and the underlying software system's international functionality.\n   3. Message processing in Web Services. e.g. SOAP Fault message etc.\n\nThe scope of this document is described in the section 1.1 below.\n\n1.1 Scope\n\nThis document follows the definition of Web Services specified in the Chapter 2, Web services Architecture Document [1].\n\nDefinition: A Web service is a software system identified by a URI, whose public interfaces and bindings are defined and described using XML. Its definition can be discovered by other software systems. These systems may then interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed by its definition, using XML based messages conveyed by Internet protocols.\n\nIn order to narrow down the scope, the usage scenarios in this document are limited to the following W3C technologies and deliverables.\n\n    * SOAP V1.2 Documents\n    * WSDL V1.2 Documents\n    * Web Services Architecture Documents\n\nIdeally, internationalized Web Services should be easy to create, publish and discover. \n\nThe scope of Web Services internationalization is:\n\n    * W3C internationalization working group deliverables, including:\n      * Web services requirements\n      * Unicode Inc. technologies and deliverables\n      * Concepts and application of distributed Locales and locale-affected preferences\n      * Web services internationalization best practices\n\n-------\n\nAddison P.

To help illustrate our comments, we have included several scenarios in our Usage Scenarios document, which you can find here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/\n\nThe scenarios that apply to this issue are 2.3 through 2.9.\n\nBasically our concerns are:\n\n1. Most operating environments do not provide a mechanism that will enable Web service providers to enumerate and generate all of the available languages, except by looping over the complete possible list of languages. \n   a. Expanding the SOAP definition to allow an arbitrary number of natural language messages will result in very poor performance. \n   b. On some platforms, it is not possible to loop over the install locales because the list of locales cannot be obtained.\n\n2. Sending back all or many of the available languages will result in very large or greatly expanded documents that provide limited or no additional utility.\n\n3. Most operating environments do provide a mechanism for finding the best matching localized messages for a given (specified) language preference.\n\n4. Of the major transports available for Web services, only HTTP offers any form of language negotiation (via the Accept-Language header). Since the transport is independent of the SOAP document itself and this header is generated by the specific system creating the connection, there are several chained, connectionless and multipoint WS scenarios in which an intermediary system may interrupt the flow of language preference from the requestor to the provider and back.\n\nIn other words, although the proposed revision allows multiple languages, implementers will not be able to use this feature to solve the problem or will only be able to use it in a limited way.\n\nAs a result we feel that, at a minimum, SOAP should either provide a mechanism for specifying the \"international context\" for a Web services interaction or this section should be modified to more emphatically state the need for such a mechanism. Such mechanisms might include:\n\n- A general recommendation that each Web service provide a language negotiation mechanism and that this mechanism be used in providing human readable natural language text, such as SOAPFault reasontext attributes.\n- A specific \"Accept-Language\" SOAP header along the lines of RFC3066 (which defines the HTTP Accept-Language header)\n- An \"International Context\" SOAP header that provides extensible support for other i18n-related information\n\nAt issue is whether XMLP/SOAP should define this mechanism directly in SOAP 1.2 or whether XMLP/SOAP or I18N WSTF should work on defining this mechanism separately (and it be incorporated by reference into future Web services recommendations). We welcome your feedback on how to proceed with this issue.\n\nWe also have the following comments:\n\n1. Specifically state that the first env:Text entry should be considered the \"default\" text, to be used when no match is obtained by the requestor with languages in the list. This ensures that the human reader always has some text available.\n\n2. We note that the various drafts at http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/, including the editor's copy (http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part1.html) do not seem to contain the proposed changes. We would like to opportunity to review and comment on these changes. The text in your proposed resolution appears to address our other concerns except for the issues noted above.\n\nRegards, etc....;\n=========\nMessage-Id: <4.2.0.58.J.20021124053643.04a19690@localhost>\nDate: Sun, 24 Nov 2002 05:48:46 +0900\nTo: public-i18n-ws@w3.org\nFrom: Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org>\nCc: w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org\nSubject: Fwd: XMLP Issue 263 Resolution\n\n\nDear WS I18N Task Force Members,\n\nThis is the first of a series of responses to last call\ncomments on the SOAP 1.2 specification that I sent in to\nthe XML Protocol WG on behalf of the old I18N WG a whil ago.\n\nAt the meeting today, the WS I18N task force went through\nthese responses to decide whether they should be accepted\nor not, and coming up with some comments.\n\nA list of the issues can be found starting at\nhttp://w3c3.inria.fr/2000/xp/Group/xmlp-lc-issues.html#x256.\n\nThe way we want to proceed is that I forward the responses from\nthe XML Protocol WG to the public-i18n-ws@w3.org list, then\nwe will follow up with some proposed answers, and if we don't\nget any comments on the list, we'll forward these back to\nthe XML Protocol list.\n\nFor this first message, I'm copying the I18N IG list, to make\nsure that people on the Core Task Force (officially responsible\nfor reviews) can join the public-i18n-ws@w3.org list or ca\nlook at the archive to follow up on this discussion.\n\nRegards,     Martin.\n\n>Date: Fri, 02 Aug 2002 23:53:44 +0900\n>From: Ryuji Inoue <ryuji@isl.mei.co.jp>\n>To: xmlp-comments@w3.org\n>Cc: duerst@w3.org, ryuji@isl.mei.co.jp\n>Subject: XMLP Issue 263 Resolution\n>\n>Martin,\n>\n>The XML Protocol (XMLP) WG has decided to close issue 263 [1], which you\n>originated, with the following resolution.\n>\n>\n>The XMLP WG has decided to modify SOAP Reason element (5.4.2 in Part1)\n>in the following manner:\n>\n>   - The Reason element information item has one or more Text element\n>     information item children:\n>\n>       <env:Reason>\n>           <env:Text xml:lang=\"en-US\">wrong color</env:Text>\n>           <env:Text xml:lang=\"en-GB\">wrong colour</env:Text>\n>       </env:Reason>\n>\n>   - The Text element information item has any number of character\n>     information item children to explain the neture of the fault.\n>\n>   - Each Text element MUST have xml:lang attribute information item\n>     (prefix of lang attribute information item MUST be \"xml:\").\n>\n>   - When there are multiple Text element information items, values of\n>     xml:lang attribute information items MUST be unique.\n>\n>Applications can make multiple language versions of the fault text\n>available using this mechanism.

To help illustrate our comments, we have included several scenarios in our Usage Scenarios document, which you can find here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/\n\nThe scenarios that apply to this issue are 2.3 through 2.9.\n\nBasically our concerns are:\n\n1. Most operating environments do not provide a mechanism that will enable Web service providers to enumerate and generate all of the available languages, except by looping over the complete possible list of languages. \n   a. Expanding the SOAP definition to allow an arbitrary number of natural language messages will result in very poor performance. \n   b. On some platforms, it is not possible to loop over the installed locales because the list of locales cannot be obtained.\n\n2. Sending back many or all of the available languages will result in very large or greatly expanded documents that provide limited or no additional utility.\n\n3. Most operating environments do provide a mechanism for finding the best matching localized messages for a given (specified) language preference, but this cannot be applied without some language/content negotiation.\n\n4. Of the major transports available for Web services, only HTTP offers any form of language negotiation (via the Accept-Language header). Since the transport is independent of the SOAP document itself and this header is generated by the specific system creating the connection, there are several chained, connectionless and multipoint WS scenarios in which an intermediary system may interrupt the flow of language preference from the requestor to the provider and back.\n\nIn other words, although the proposed revision allows multiple languages, implementers will not be able to use this feature to solve the problem or will only be able to use it in a limited way.\n\nAs a result we feel that, at a minimum, SOAP should either provide a mechanism for specifying the \"international context\" for a Web services interaction or this section should be modified to more emphatically state the need for such a mechanism. Such mechanisms might include:\n\n- A general recommendation that each Web service provide a language negotiation mechanism and that this mechanism be used in providing human readable natural language text, such as SOAPFault reasontext attributes.\n- A specific \"Accept-Language\" SOAP header along the lines of RFC3066 (which defines the HTTP Accept-Language header)\n- An \"International Context\" SOAP header that provides extensible support for other i18n-related information\n\nAt issue is whether XMLP/SOAP should define this mechanism directly in SOAP 1.2 or whether XMLP/SOAP or I18N WSTF should work on defining this mechanism separately (and it be incorporated by reference into future Web services recommendations). We welcome your feedback on how to proceed with this issue: it is part of our charter to work on such issues.\n\nWe also have the following comments:\n\n1. Specifically state that the first env:Text entry should be considered the \"default\" text, to be used when no match is obtained by the requestor with languages in the list. This ensures that the human reader always has some text available.\n\n2. We note that the various drafts at http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/, including the editor's copy (http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part1.html) do not seem to contain the proposed changes. We would like to opportunity to review and comment on these changes. The text in your proposed resolution appears to address our concerns except as noted above.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison (on behalf of W3C-I18N-WG)\n\nAddison P.

            "content": "Dear XMLP Editors,\n\nSome time ago I worked with webMethods' XMLP rep, Asir, to produce a rewrite of SOAP 1.2 Part 2 Appendix B [1]. This is issue #270 [2] on your issues list. More recently I became the chair of the I18N-WG's Web Services task force, which has been delegated the review of Web Services recommendations, etc., by the I18N-WG Core group. At our recent face-to-face we reviewed the various i18n issues in SOAP 1.2 to ensure that we understood the actions taken by XMLP/SOAP WG and that we had no further comments.\n\nOne of the issues our task force reviewed was Appendix B. As I remarked in our last exchange (see the bottom of this email for a refresher), the text was pretty hard to read and very difficult to understand. The I18N-WG resolved therefore to prepare an improved version, which is included in this message between the ---- lines.\n\nThis version is functionally identical to the previous version. However, it should be easier to understand and therefore to correctly implement. Would you please incorporate this version into SOAP 1.2 Part 2 in place of the current version?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison (on behalf of W3C-I18N-WG)\n\nAddison P.

Mapping Application Defined Names to XML Names\n\nThis appendix details an algorithm for taking an application defined name, such as the name of a variable or field in a programming language, and mapping it to the Unicode characters that are legal in the names of XML elements and attributes as defined in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nNote: Application defined names are generally subject to the specific restrictions of their underlying development environment. Ideally these names should restricted to the subset of Unicode characters in accordance with the guidelines in Unicode Standard Annex #15, Annex 7 (\"Programming Language Identifiers\")[1]. Names that follow these guidelines will generally also follow the guidelines in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nHex Digits\n\n[5]    hexDigit    ::=    [0-9A-F]\n* Note, only uppercase letters A-F are defined here.\n\nB.1 Rules for mapping application defined names to XML Names\n\n1. An XML Name has two parts: Prefix and LocalPart. Let Prefix be determined per the rules and constraints specified in Namespaces in XML [3]. The LocalPart will be determined by transforming the application name of the object as follows.\n\n2. Let \"T\" be the application name. \"T\" must be represented by a sequence of Unicode characters in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) [2]. Let \"M\" be the output of this algorithm, also as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n\nNote: If the name in the application is represented in some non-Unicode character encoding, it must be converted to Unicode before starting the name mapping process. Ideally any such conversion will use a reversable conversion (so that the original byte sequence can be obtained from the Unicode sequence), although this is not possible for some encodings.\n\nNote: Characters in the application name's original encoding that do not have a mapping to Unicode should be handled in some reasonable, application defined manner.\n\nNote: \"A sequence of Unicode characters\" means a sequence of code points (sometimes called Unicode Scalar Values). This should not be taken to imply that the characters are using any particular encoding of Unicode. The conversion algorithm itself may use whatever Unicode encoding is most convenient on that platform. However, it is important to note that surrogate pair sequences (pairs of UTF-16 code points that represent characters in Unicode above U+FFFF) must be handled as a single Unicode code point (their Scalar Value, that is the specific supplemental character they represent), rather than as the individual bytes or surrogate characters in UTF-16. Unpaired surrogates are not permitted. For example:\n\nThe UTF-16 sequence 0xD800 0xDC00 represents the Unicode character U+10000. When performing the following steps, the value U+10000 is considered to be a single Unicode character in the sequence T.\n\n3. Let \"i\" be an integer representing the current position in \"T\", T(i), with a starting value of 1, such that T(1) is the first character in T, T(2) is the second, and so forth. Let \"n\" represent the last position in T, T(n).\n\n4. Starting with 1, iterate across T by increasing i by 1 and perform the following evaluation on each character. \n\n   a. If T begins with the string \"xml\" (or any upper/lower case variation, such as \"xmL\", \"XML\", or \"xMl\"), encode T(1) using rule 4.c.i (that is, output either \"_x0078_\" for \"x\" or \"_x0058_\" for \"X\") and increase \"i\" to 4.\n\n   Note: if the sequence starts with \"xml\"/\"XML\"/\"xMl\"/etc., and is followed by a Unicode combining character, the combining character is not considered part of the letter \"l\" for processing purposes. By contrast, precomposed characters such as U+013B (Latin letter capital L with cedilla) do not trigger this rule. That is \"xm??\" is encoded as xm??, whereas xml(U+0300) is encoded as _x0078_ml_x0300_. [Note that Normalization Form C means that this special case will always produce the same resulting sequence.]\n\n   b. If T(i) falls in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF (that is, there is an unpaired surrogate character in the sequence), stop with an error.\n\n   c. Else if T(i) is not a valid XML NCName character (see [3]) or if i=1 and T(i) is not a valid first character of an XML NCName (see [3]) then:\n\n      i. If T(i) < U+10000 and T(i) is not in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by four hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value followed by an underscore (\"_\") (for example, \"x\" (U+0078) would be encoded as \"_x0078_\").\n\n      ii. Else if T(i) > U+FFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by eight hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value. For example, the character 0x10FFFE would be encoded as \"_x0010FFFE_\".\n\n   d. Else if T(i) = \"_\" (lowline) and T(i+1) = \"x\" or \"X\", output \"_x005F_\" to M.\n\n   e. Else output T(i) to M.\n\n[1] http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/#Programming_Language_Identifiers\n[2] http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/\n[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nHello world -> Hello_x0020_world  // space not permitted\nHello_xorld -> Hello_x005F_xorld  // _x rule\nHelloworld_ -> Helloworld_        \n\n          x -> x\n        xml -> _x0078_ml   // starts with xml\n       -xml -> _x002D_xml  // starts with hyphen-minus\n       x-ml -> x-ml        // not the string xml\n\n     ??lfred -> ??lfred\n   ???????????????? -> ????????????????\n????????????        -> _x1709__x1705__x170E__x1708_   // the Tagalog block is newer and not permitted in XML 1.0\n?????????         -> _x13D9__x13DA__x13A5_  // The Cherokee block is newer and not permitted in XML 1.0\n\nxml??moo -> _x0078_ml_x0300_moo  // Starts with \"xml\". Note that combining character U+0300 is considered as separate from the \"l\" in \"xml\".\n\nNote to editor> The last example is the only one that I have changed (added).\n      \n\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Martin Gudgin [mailto:mgudgin@microsoft.com]\n> Sent: Sunday, August 25, 2002 6:03 PM\n> To: Addison Phillips [wM]; asirv@webmethods.com\n> Cc: W3C Public Archive; Jean-Jacques Moreau; Marc Hadley; Nilo Mitra;\n> Noah Mendelson; Henrik Frystyk Nielsen\n> Subject: RE: Algorithm for mapping an application defined name to an XML\n> name\n> \n> \n> Addison,\n> \n> Thanks very much for your detailed comments.

Mapping Application Defined Names to XML Names\n>\n> This appendix details an algorithm for taking an application defined name,\nsuch as the name of a variable or field in a programming language, and\nmapping it to the Unicode characters that are legal in the names of XML\nelements and attributes as defined in [Namespaces in XML].\n>\n> Note: Application defined names are generally subject to the specific\nrestrictions of their underlying development environment. Ideally these\nnames should restricted to the subset of Unicode characters in accordance\nwith the guidelines in Unicode Standard Annex #15, Annex 7 (\"Programming\nLanguage Identifiers\")[1]. Names that follow these guidelines will generally\nalso follow the guidelines in [Namespaces in XML].\n>\n> Hex Digits\n>\n> [5]    hexDigit    ::=    [0-9A-F]\n> * Note, only uppercase letters A-F are defined here.\n>\n> B.1 Rules for mapping application defined names to XML Names\n>\n> 1. An XML Name has two parts: Prefix and LocalPart. Let Prefix be\ndetermined per the rules and constraints specified in Namespaces in XML [3].\nThe LocalPart will be determined by transforming the application name of the\nobject as follows.\n>\n> 2. Let \"T\" be the application name. \"T\" must be represented by a sequence\nof Unicode characters in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) [2]. Let \"M\" be\nthe output of this algorithm, also as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n>\n> Note: If the name in the application is represented in some non-Unicode\ncharacter encoding, it must be converted to Unicode before starting the name\nmapping process. Ideally any such conversion will use a reversable\nconversion (so that the original byte sequence can be obtained from the\nUnicode sequence), although this is not possible for some encodings.\n>\n> Note: Characters in the application name's original encoding that do not\nhave a mapping to Unicode should be handled in some reasonable, application\ndefined manner.\n>\n> Note: \"A sequence of Unicode characters\" means a sequence of code points\n(sometimes called Unicode Scalar Values). This should not be taken to imply\nthat the characters are using any particular encoding of Unicode. The\nconversion algorithm itself may use whatever Unicode encoding is most\nconvenient on that platform. However, it is important to note that surrogate\npair sequences (pairs of UTF-16 code points that represent characters in\nUnicode above U+FFFF) must be handled as a single Unicode code point (their\nScalar Value, that is the specific supplemental character they represent),\nrather than as the individual bytes or surrogate characters in UTF-16.\nUnpaired surrogates are not permitted. For example:\n>\n> The UTF-16 sequence 0xD800 0xDC00 represents the Unicode character\nU+10000. When performing the following steps, the value U+10000 is\nconsidered to be a single Unicode character in the sequence T.\n>\n> 3. Let \"i\" be an integer representing the current position in \"T\", T(i),\nwith a starting value of 1, such that T(1) is the first character in T, T(2)\nis the second, and so forth. Let \"n\" represent the last position in T, T(n).\n>\n> 4. Starting with 1, iterate across T by increasing i by 1 and perform the\nfollowing evaluation on each character.\n>\n>    a. If T begins with the string \"xml\" (or any upper/lower case\nvariation, such as \"xmL\", \"XML\", or \"xMl\"), encode T(1) using rule 4.c.i\n(that is, output either \"_x0078_\" for \"x\" or \"_x0058_\" for \"X\") and increase\n\"i\" to 4.\n>\n>    Note: if the sequence starts with \"xml\"/\"XML\"/\"xMl\"/etc., and is\nfollowed by a Unicode combining character, the combining character is not\nconsidered part of the letter \"l\" for processing purposes. By contrast,\nprecomposed characters such as U+013B (Latin letter capital L with cedilla)\ndo not trigger this rule. That is \"xm??\" is encoded as xm??, whereas\nxml(U+0300) is encoded as _x0078_ml_x0300_. [Note that Normalization Form C\nmeans that this special case will always produce the same resulting\nsequence.]\n>\n>    b. If T(i) falls in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF (that is, there is\nan unpaired surrogate character in the sequence), stop with an error.\n>\n>    c. Else if T(i) is not a valid XML NCName character (see [3]) or if i=1\nand T(i) is not a valid first character of an XML NCName (see [3]) then:\n>\n>       i. If T(i) < U+10000 and T(i) is not in the range 0xD800 through\n0xDFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by four hexDigits\nrepresenting the Unicode Scalar Value followed by an underscore (\"_\") (for\nexample, \"x\" (U+0078) would be encoded as \"_x0078_\").\n>\n>       ii.

This is issue #270 [2] on your\nissues list. More recently I became the chair of the I18N-WG's Web Services\ntask force, which has been delegated the review of Web Services\nrecommendations, etc., by the I18N-WG Core group. At our recent\nface-to-face we reviewed the various i18n issues in SOAP 1.2 to ensure that\nwe understood the actions taken by XMLP/SOAP WG and that we had no further\ncomments.\n\nOne of the issues our task force reviewed was Appendix B. As I remarked in\nour last exchange (see the bottom of this email for a refresher), the text\nwas pretty hard to read and very difficult to understand. The I18N-WG\nresolved therefore to prepare an improved version, which is included in\nthis message between the ---- lines.\n\nThis version is functionally identical to the previous version. However, it\nshould be easier to understand and therefore to correctly implement. Would\nyou please incorporate this version into SOAP 1.2 Part 2 in place of the\ncurrent version?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison (on behalf of W3C-I18N-WG)\n\nAddison P.

Mapping Application Defined Names to XML Names\n\nThis appendix details an algorithm for taking an application defined name,\nsuch as the name of a variable or field in a programming language, and\nmapping it to the Unicode characters that are legal in the names of XML\nelements and attributes as defined in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nNote: Application defined names are generally subject to the specific\nrestrictions of their underlying development environment. Ideally these\nnames should restricted to the subset of Unicode characters in accordance\nwith the guidelines in Unicode Standard Annex #15, Annex 7 (\"Programming\nLanguage Identifiers\")[1]. Names that follow these guidelines will\ngenerally also follow the guidelines in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nHex Digits\n\n[5]    hexDigit    ::=    [0-9A-F]\n* Note, only uppercase letters A-F are defined here.\n\nB.1 Rules for mapping application defined names to XML Names\n\n1. An XML Name has two parts: Prefix and LocalPart. Let Prefix be\ndetermined per the rules and constraints specified in Namespaces in XML\n[3]. The LocalPart will be determined by transforming the application name\nof the object as follows.\n\n2. Let \"T\" be the application name. \"T\" must be represented by a sequence\nof Unicode characters in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC) [2]. Let \"M\" be\nthe output of this algorithm, also as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n\nNote: If the name in the application is represented in some non-Unicode\ncharacter encoding, it must be converted to Unicode before starting the\nname mapping process. Ideally any such conversion will use a reversable\nconversion (so that the original byte sequence can be obtained from the\nUnicode sequence), although this is not possible for some encodings.\n\nNote: Characters in the application name's original encoding that do not\nhave a mapping to Unicode should be handled in some reasonable, application\ndefined manner.\n\nNote: \"A sequence of Unicode characters\" means a sequence of code points\n(sometimes called Unicode Scalar Values). This should not be taken to imply\nthat the characters are using any particular encoding of Unicode. The\nconversion algorithm itself may use whatever Unicode encoding is most\nconvenient on that platform. However, it is important to note that\nsurrogate pair sequences (pairs of UTF-16 code points that represent\ncharacters in Unicode above U+FFFF) must be handled as a single Unicode\ncode point (their Scalar Value, that is the specific supplemental character\nthey represent), rather than as the individual bytes or surrogate\ncharacters in UTF-16. Unpaired surrogates are not permitted. For example:\n\nThe UTF-16 sequence 0xD800 0xDC00 represents the Unicode character U+10000.\nWhen performing the following steps, the value U+10000 is considered to be\na single Unicode character in the sequence T.\n\n3. Let \"i\" be an integer representing the current position in \"T\", T(i),\nwith a starting value of 1, such that T(1) is the first character in T,\nT(2) is the second, and so forth. Let \"n\" represent the last position in T,\nT(n).\n\n4. Starting with 1, iterate across T by increasing i by 1 and perform the\nfollowing evaluation on each character.\n\n   a. If T begins with the string \"xml\" (or any upper/lower case variation,\nsuch as \"xmL\", \"XML\", or \"xMl\"), encode T(1) using rule 4.c.i (that is,\noutput either \"_x0078_\" for \"x\" or \"_x0058_\" for \"X\") and increase \"i\" to\n4.\n\n   Note: if the sequence starts with \"xml\"/\"XML\"/\"xMl\"/etc., and is\nfollowed by a Unicode combining character, the combining character is not\nconsidered part of the letter \"l\" for processing purposes. By contrast,\nprecomposed characters such as U+013B (Latin letter capital L with cedilla)\ndo not trigger this rule. That is \"xm??\" is encoded as xm??, whereas\nxml(U+0300) is encoded as _x0078_ml_x0300_. [Note that Normalization Form C\nmeans that this special case will always produce the same resulting\nsequence.]\n\n   b. If T(i) falls in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF (that is, there is\nan unpaired surrogate character in the sequence), stop with an error.\n\n   c. Else if T(i) is not a valid XML NCName character (see [3]) or if i=1\nand T(i) is not a valid first character of an XML NCName (see [3]) then:\n\n      i. If T(i) < U+10000 and T(i) is not in the range 0xD800 through\n0xDFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by four hexDigits\nrepresenting the Unicode Scalar Value followed by an underscore (\"_\") (for\nexample, \"x\" (U+0078) would be encoded as \"_x0078_\").\n\n      ii. Else if T(i) > U+FFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed\nby eight hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value. For example, the\ncharacter 0x10FFFE would be encoded as \"_x0010FFFE_\".\n\n   d. Else if T(i) = \"_\" (lowline) and T(i+1) = \"x\" or \"X\", output\n\"_x005F_\" to M.\n\n   e. Else output T(i) to M.\n\n[1]\nhttp://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/#Programming_Language_Identifiers\n\n[2] http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/\n[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nHello world -> Hello_x0020_world  // space not permitted\nHello_xorld -> Hello_x005F_xorld  // _x rule\nHelloworld_ -> Helloworld_\n\n          x -> x\n        xml -> _x0078_ml   // starts with xml\n       -xml -> _x002D_xml  // starts with hyphen-minus\n       x-ml -> x-ml        // not the string xml\n\n     ??lfred -> ??lfred\n   ???????????????? -> ????????????????\n????????????        -> _x1709__x1705__x170E__x1708_   // the Tagalog block is newer and\nnot permitted in XML 1.0\n?????????         -> _x13D9__x13DA__x13A5_  // The Cherokee block is newer and not\npermitted in XML 1.0\n\nxml??moo -> _x0078_ml_x0300_moo  // Starts with \"xml\".

To help\nillustrate our comments, we have included several scenarios in our Usage\nScenarios document, which you can find here:\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/\n\nThe scenarios that apply to this issue are 2.3 through 2.9.\n\nBasically our concerns are:\n\n1. Most operating environments do not provide a mechanism that will enable\nWeb service providers to enumerate and generate all of the available\nlanguages, except by looping over the complete possible list of languages.\n   a. Expanding the SOAP definition to allow an arbitrary number of natural\nlanguage messages will result in very poor performance.\n   b. On some platforms, it is not possible to loop over the installed\nlocales because the list of locales cannot be obtained.\n\n2. Sending back many or all of the available languages will result in very\nlarge or greatly expanded documents that provide limited or no additional\nutility.\n\n3. Most operating environments do provide a mechanism for finding the best\nmatching localized messages for a given (specified) language preference,\nbut this cannot be applied without some language/content negotiation.\n\n4. Of the major transports available for Web services, only HTTP offers any\nform of language negotiation (via the Accept-Language header). Since the\ntransport is independent of the SOAP document itself and this header is\ngenerated by the specific system creating the connection, there are several\nchained, connectionless and multipoint WS scenarios in which an\nintermediary system may interrupt the flow of language preference from the\nrequestor to the provider and back.\n\nIn other words, although the proposed revision allows multiple languages,\nimplementers will not be able to use this feature to solve the problem or\nwill only be able to use it in a limited way.\n\nAs a result we feel that, at a minimum, SOAP should either provide a\nmechanism for specifying the \"international context\" for a Web services\ninteraction or this section should be modified to more emphatically state\nthe need for such a mechanism. Such mechanisms might include:\n\n- A general recommendation that each Web service provide a language\nnegotiation mechanism and that this mechanism be used in providing human\nreadable natural language text, such as SOAPFault reasontext attributes.\n- A specific \"Accept-Language\" SOAP header along the lines of RFC3066\n(which defines the HTTP Accept-Language header)\n- An \"International Context\" SOAP header that provides extensible support\nfor other i18n-related information\n\nAt issue is whether XMLP/SOAP should define this mechanism directly in SOAP\n1.2 or whether XMLP/SOAP or I18N WSTF should work on defining this\nmechanism separately (and it be incorporated by reference into future Web\nservices recommendations). We welcome your feedback on how to proceed with\nthis issue: it is part of our charter to work on such issues.\n\nWe also have the following comments:\n\n1. Specifically state that the first env:Text entry should be considered\nthe \"default\" text, to be used when no match is obtained by the requestor\nwith languages in the list. This ensures that the human reader always has\nsome text available.\n\n2.

It's not our intention to \nthrow off your schedule or save all of our comments for the very last \nsecond. I don't think that these particular comments (263) require any \ntextual changes to SOAP at this juncuture and we don't really have a \nsolution on offer here, so I didn't expect anything more.\n\nI should note that our responses were delayed by I18N-WG's rechartering \neffort. The Web Services TF was only formed in the last two months and \nthis was the very first business we undertook at our first meeting, an \nFTF at the end of November. Despite the late date, the WSTF wanted to \nget our comments into your hands as quickly as possible, whatever their \ndisposition.\n\nIn the future we hope to provide feedback and constructive commentary \nearly in your process, where it will do some good.\n\nThanks,\n\nAddison\n\n-- \nAddison P.

To help\n> illustrate our comments, we have included several scenarios in our Usage\n> Scenarios document, which you can find here:\n> http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/\n> \n> The scenarios that apply to this issue are 2.3 through 2.9.\n> \n> Basically our concerns are:\n> \n> 1. Most operating environments do not provide a mechanism that will enable\n> Web service providers to enumerate and generate all of the available\n> languages, except by looping over the complete possible list of languages.\n>    a. Expanding the SOAP definition to allow an arbitrary number of natural\n> language messages will result in very poor performance.\n>    b. On some platforms, it is not possible to loop over the installed\n> locales because the list of locales cannot be obtained.\n> \n> 2. Sending back many or all of the available languages will result in very\n> large or greatly expanded documents that provide limited or no additional\n> utility.\n> \n> 3. Most operating environments do provide a mechanism for finding the best\n> matching localized messages for a given (specified) language preference,\n> but this cannot be applied without some language/content negotiation.\n> \n> 4. Of the major transports available for Web services, only HTTP offers any\n> form of language negotiation (via the Accept-Language header). Since the\n> transport is independent of the SOAP document itself and this header is\n> generated by the specific system creating the connection, there are several\n> chained, connectionless and multipoint WS scenarios in which an\n> intermediary system may interrupt the flow of language preference from the\n> requestor to the provider and back.\n> \n> In other words, although the proposed revision allows multiple languages,\n> implementers will not be able to use this feature to solve the problem or\n> will only be able to use it in a limited way.\n> \n> As a result we feel that, at a minimum, SOAP should either provide a\n> mechanism for specifying the \"international context\" for a Web services\n> interaction or this section should be modified to more emphatically state\n> the need for such a mechanism. Such mechanisms might include:\n> \n> - A general recommendation that each Web service provide a language\n> negotiation mechanism and that this mechanism be used in providing human\n> readable natural language text, such as SOAPFault reasontext attributes.\n> - A specific \"Accept-Language\" SOAP header along the lines of RFC3066\n> (which defines the HTTP Accept-Language header)\n> - An \"International Context\" SOAP header that provides extensible support\n> for other i18n-related information\n> \n> At issue is whether XMLP/SOAP should define this mechanism directly in SOAP\n> 1.2 or whether XMLP/SOAP or I18N WSTF should work on defining this\n> mechanism separately (and it be incorporated by reference into future Web\n> services recommendations).

Let \"M\" be\n> the output of this algorithm, also as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n> \n> Note: If the name in the application is represented in some non-Unicode\n> character encoding, it must be converted to Unicode before starting the\n> name mapping process. Ideally any such conversion will use a reversable\n> conversion (so that the original byte sequence can be obtained from the\n> Unicode sequence), although this is not possible for some encodings.\n> \n> Note: Characters in the application name's original encoding that do not\n> have a mapping to Unicode should be handled in some reasonable, application\n> defined manner.\n> \n> Note: \"A sequence of Unicode characters\" means a sequence of code points\n> (sometimes called Unicode Scalar Values). This should not be taken to imply\n> that the characters are using any particular encoding of Unicode. The\n> conversion algorithm itself may use whatever Unicode encoding is most\n> convenient on that platform. However, it is important to note that\n> surrogate pair sequences (pairs of UTF-16 code points that represent\n> characters in Unicode above U+FFFF) must be handled as a single Unicode\n> code point (their Scalar Value, that is the specific supplemental character\n> they represent), rather than as the individual bytes or surrogate\n> characters in UTF-16. Unpaired surrogates are not permitted. For example:\n> \n> The UTF-16 sequence 0xD800 0xDC00 represents the Unicode character U+10000.\n> When performing the following steps, the value U+10000 is considered to be\n> a single Unicode character in the sequence T.\n> \n> 3. Let \"i\" be an integer representing the current position in \"T\", T(i),\n> with a starting value of 1, such that T(1) is the first character in T,\n> T(2) is the second, and so forth. Let \"n\" represent the last position in T,\n> T(n).\n> \n> 4. Starting with 1, iterate across T by increasing i by 1 and perform the\n> following evaluation on each character.\n> \n>    a. If T begins with the string \"xml\" (or any upper/lower case variation,\n> such as \"xmL\", \"XML\", or \"xMl\"), encode T(1) using rule 4.c.i (that is,\n> output either \"_x0078_\" for \"x\" or \"_x0058_\" for \"X\") and increase \"i\" to\n> 4.\n> \n>    Note: if the sequence starts with \"xml\"/\"XML\"/\"xMl\"/etc., and is\n> followed by a Unicode combining character, the combining character is not\n> considered part of the letter \"l\" for processing purposes.

            "subject": "RE: Issue 263 Respons",
            "content": "This is not a WG response but a comment from me as an individual member\nof the XML Protocol WG (for a WG response, see [1] by David Fallside).\n\nWhile I am glad to see your positive response [2] to David's statement,\nthe purpose of this mail is to provide some background and clarification\nof the resolution provided by the XML Protocol WG. I hope this may be of\nassistance in evaluating the concerns you raise.\n\nThe concerns 1) and 2) seem to imply that the intent of the resolution\nprovided is to have a sender generate a reason text in all languages\nsupported by the sender. However, as you point out in 3), and with which\nI agree, this makes little sense as there is no guarantee that there is\nany overlap between the sender's and the receiver's natural language and\nobvious performance problems as a result of doing so. The purpose of the\nresolution is therefore merely to *enable* the support for indicating\nmultiple natural languages in a SOAP fault.\n\nWhat I don't agree with is jumping to the conclusion that the core SOAP\nmessaging framework should provide a specific language negotiation\nmechanism. I think there are several reasons for keeping things separate\nin this regard:\n\nA) It is not clear to me that one would want a dedicated natural\nlanguage negotiation mechanism for SOAP faults and not for other parts\nof the message, or even for other parameters, i18n or otherwise, to be\ndeclared or negotiated. For example, HTTP provides negotiation for not\nonly natural language but for a variety of parameters such as character\nset, media type, and content encoding, only some of which are i18n\nrelated. Defining a negotiation mechanism is, as you know, not a small\nundertaking: It would require gathering requirements, usage scenarios\n(maybe similar to those you have already begun listing), and determining\nhow it may relate to existing mechanisms. By itself this task is out of\nscope of what the XML Protocol WG is chartered to do.\n\nB) I don't see any requirement for a negotiation mechanism to be\nembedded within the SOAP messaging framework. In fact, it would seem\nuseful to have the general negotiation mechanism be separate so that it\nmay be applicable in other contexts too. For example, the negotiation\nmechanism defined in HTTP based on accept* header fields is also used in\nother protocols like SIP and RTSP. Similarly, an XML-based negotiation\nmechanism may be applicable in a wider context.\n\nC) The very point of negotiation is that there is a bidirectional\ncommunication like for example a request followed by a response. While\nSOAP supports such kinds of interactions, it also supports one-way\nmessages and other message exchange patterns that may potentially\ninclude more than two parties. It is not clear that the same negotiation\nmechanism will apply in these scenarios.\n\nRegarding a few specific comments:\n\n> - A general recommendation that each Web service provide a language\n> negotiation mechanism and that this mechanism be used in providing \n> human readable natural language text, such as SOAPFault reasontext \n> attributes.\n\nI absolute agree making a general recommendation for how to consider\ni18n related issues--this makes a lot of sense. In fact, one could argue\nthat this would be better stated as an architectural principle rather\nthan as part of the SOAP specification. Given the reasons above,\nhowever, I would be weary having SOAP provide or recommend any\nparticular solution in this space as I can see multiple potentially\napplicable solutions.\n\n> - A specific \"Accept-Language\" SOAP header along the lines of RFC3066 \n> (which defines the HTTP Accept-Language header)\n\nNote that the \"accept-language\" HTTP request header field and its role\nin the HTTP content negotiation mechanism is defined by HTTP and not RFC\n3066. RFC 3066 defines an identifier mechanism and a registration\nmechanism for possible values of this header field.\n\n> - An \"International Context\" SOAP header that provides extensible \n> support for other i18n-related information\n\nBefore doing so, I think it should at least be evaluated whether it\nwould make sense to have such a mechanism be isolated to i18n-related\ninformation or whether it should apply to other areas as well.\n\n>We also have the following comments:\n>\n>1. Specifically state that the first env:Text entry should be \n>considered the \"default\" text, to be used when no match is obtained by \n>the requestor with languages in the list. This ensures that the human \n>reader always has some text available.\n\nIn my opinion this is entirely an implementation/configuration issue of\nthe receiver. In general, there is no requirement that there be a human\ndirectly associated with either a SOAP sender or a SOAP receiver, nor\nthat any particular parts of a SOAP message be exposed to a human.\n\nGiven the above, I personally believe the XML Protocol WG made pretty\nmuch the right trade off when considering support for multiple natural\nlanguages in a SOAP fault reason.\n\nThank you,\n\nHenrik Frystyk Nielsen\nmailto:henrikn@microsoft.com\n\n[1] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2002Dec/0019.html\n[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2002Dec/0020.html\n\n\n\n"

Addison to change the bridge. Meeting on the 31st is canceled.\n\n            o Discuss Action Items.\n            o Discuss next FTF meeting. Tentatively at IUC23 in Prague.\n\n-Gave up our slot at the Technical Plenary to GEO and Core. Martin to represent the TF at the plenary mtg.\n-Investigating holding the next FTF in Prague before/after the IUC. Probably before.\n-Able to attend in Prague: Addison, Martin, Tex, Mike?; Unable to attend: Kentaroh, Takao.\n-Cathy Wissink may attend for Takao. Possibly Mark Davis for Kentaroh. Each will update us on any substitutes.\n-Other possible meeting dates: mid-January (Scottsdale, AZ, USA) is where we might catch WS WGs. Since no one can\n attend at that time, that meeting won't work.\n-General note: we need to schedule out our activities so that members can figure out the scope of traveling necessary.\n-Need to figure out location and logistics. Possibilities include cooperation of IUC (Martin/Addison to discuss with\n Richard). Russ Rolfe may host the GEO at Microsoft in Prague. Takao to discuss logistics of that with him.\n\n            o Discussion adoption of Usage Scenarios Working Draft and Call for Participation.\n\n-WSTF to issue the Working Draft (today). Martin will send request, get Tim's approval, etc.\n-Kentaroh will (has already) fixed HTML so that it validates.\n-Addison to send email containing status information and call for participation. Martin to incorp.\n-Other comments: \n   _  Martin unhappy with: gDATE variables. Expunging for now. Will add notes there later.\n   _  Document approved by group. Only changes: add to status section. Fix gTypes, validation.\n   _  Added Tex to list of editors.\n\n            o Decide response to XMLP about Issue 263 (language negotiation in SOAP 1.2)\n\n-SOAP has a short CR period. Will resubmit/remind them about 270 (Appendix B text).\n-Discussion of 263. We can't catch SOAP 1.2. Need to have \"leg to stand on\" by proposing some design ourselves.\n-Decided that main activity at next meeting will be to review existing use cases and triage into activities. We felt that there might be several activities to pursue or that this issue may require broader/narrower scope based on discussion.\n-Addison to send checklist of use cases and proposed categories from USWD before next meeting.\n-No group response except for resubmit (confirm submit for CR).\n-Addison and Martin to send individual responses to Henrik's message.\n\n \n Pending Action Items\n ====================\n     * Organize calendar of activities [Addison]... Addison to post\n     * Post XML version of Usage Scenarios Working Draft (\"USWD\") [Kentaroh]... complete\n     * Call for Use Cases based on draft of USWD [Addison]... pending\n     * Post responses to XMLP [Addison]... complete\n     * Post intro text for USWD [Addison]... complete\n     * Check on list to use for USWD comments [Martin]... complete\n     * Review and approve Working Draft for public review [group]... completed at mtg.\n     * Add Mike McKenna to TF [Martin]... complete\n\n\n\n"

These documents will help identify i18n issues in Web services and may also to provide templates for implementers to address these issues.\n\n  -- This particular area will be one that we need to focus on quickly. We need to decide how to solicit, organize, and present this information. Thus, this will be a (if not \"the\") major topic of our first meeting (where we hope to progress to actually assembling some of the use cases.)\n\nOur second goal is to produce feedback (in the form of requirements) to the WS work groups to address any areas of concern that are identified. In this way we hope to support the actual WS working groups with the feedback and information they need to produce standards that will best serve international users.\n\nA particular area that many of us have identified as being of special concern is that of locale exchange on the Internet. For example, there are mechanisms for language identifiers (xml:lang, RFC3066, etc.) that are well defined, but locales do not enjoy the same support. The WS-TF will include locales and locale identifiers as one of the main areas of concern.\n\nRules and Behavior\n==================\n\nThis public list, as well at the Task Force lists and meetings, are forums in which we will discuss issues and topics that are be of great interest to all of us. As such, it is common for people to have high-spirited discussions and even disagreements. Above all, I think we each expect our fellow participants to behave professionally and to limit our comments and behavior to appropriate, on-topic commentary. Let's leave our personal and petty disagreements for other fora.\n\nSince this is an international group, I urge each of you to communicate as clearly as possible, bearing in mind that not all of us speak English primarily and that cultural difference may make it harder to be understood.\n\nI would encourage you to send in some biographical details to this list so that we get to know each other better.  Please also state your key interests in working with the group.\n\nGroups and Web Sites\n====================\nThe WS-TF is currently in the current part of the Internationalization Activity of the W3C (which falls under the Document Formats Domain, for those of you who follow such things).  It is one of three Task Forces in the I18N WG. One or more of these may become WGs in their own right at some point.  The task forces are described at http://www.w3.org/International/about.html#scope .  \n\nPlease bear in mind that all WS-TF information is in the public domain and much of our activity (such as many of our technical discussions) will take place in a public forum.  Because of the nature of our work, we have both an internal (private) mailing list and activities as well as a public mail list. The public list archives and documents can be read by any member of the public.  Please use care when posting information to ensure that there is no \"leakage\" of private information into the public space.\n\nThe Core TF operates almost wholly within the member-only space, and the GEO TF is entirely public.  If you are on one of the other task forces or a member of another working group, please do not cross-post member-confidential information to the public-i18n-ws list.\n\nThe W3C Internationalization Activity pages are found at http://www.w3.org/International .  \n\nThe WS-TF home page starts at  http://www.w3.org/International/ws - you should be able to find any information you need about the task force from here. I currently maintain the task force's pages.  I am always open to suggestions for improving them, or reminders of things I have forgotten. These pages will mirror the fact that the WS-TF is a work-in-progress, so feedback and additions are always welcome.\n\nThe full list of working group members is in member-only space at http://www.w3.org/International/Group/members.\n\nMeetings\n========\n\nAs announced on the WS home page (http://www.w3.org/International/ws)  the WG will hold its kick-off meeting in November in Boston.  The WS Task Force will hold its Face-to-Face/kick-off meeting as part of this meeting. Our meeting is scheduled for 22-23 November, 2002. You can find specific information on attending the meeting here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211.html\n\nWe will hold other FTF meetings from time-to-time, possibly in conjunction with other Web services working groups or to coincide with other activities that the task force agrees are relevent to our mission.\n\nWe will also establish regular weekly or bi-weekly teleconferences soon.  These will be useful for complex discussions, and for reaching agreement/consensus.  Since we already have members from many countries it will be interesting trying to decide on a time for the telecon.  \n\nMailing lists\n=============\n\nPlease note that the public-i18n-ws list is supposed to be focussed on discussions related to moving forward our work projects.  Please use the www-international list for any general discussion topics (you should all be subscribed to that list).  \n\nSince the archives of this list are public, it is quite possible for people who are only subscribed to www-international to follow our discussions and offer some comments or feedback on the www-international list, so we should bear that in mind.  We can also look to the www-international list for help with cultural information, linguistic or script questions, and the like.  There are currently 376 subscribers to that list, from many places around the world.\n\nW3C Culture and Process\n=======================\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium has a unique culture, and a process.  It may take a while to get an idea of this, but if you have time, having a look at the web site (http://www.w3.org/) would be a good idea.  For general information, see (http://www.w3.org/Consortium).  If you want to, you can read all of the process document http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/, but you probably have better ways of spending your time.  If any process problems come up in our work, the W3C team members will be able to help us.\n\nI am the Chair for the Task Force. Martin D??rst is the Team Contact.  Martin is also the Internationalization Activity Lead. Feel free to contact either of us concerning this task force and its activities.\n\nThat is a long enough message for one day.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions. \n\nI look forward to working closely with you in the future.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

[by the way,\n    W3C has a nice spell checker, just add \",spell\" to any URI on the\n    W3C site]\n\nIntroduction: \"This document follows SOAP V1.1\": We should try to update\n    this to SOAP V1.2 as soon as possible, because that's what W3C is\n    working on. Kentaro, do you have any idea on how much work this might be?\n\n2.3 Locale-Neutral Datatypes: This lists datatypes such as 'duration',\n    and all those starting with 'g' as 'locale neutral'. It is true\n    that in terms of formatting (an important concern with localization),\n    these are locale-neutral. But on a different level, they are not at\n    all locale-neutral.\n\n2.4 Default currency: I think this is a good example to show some of\n    the things that we will have to discuss in more detail. Making sure\n    that the right currencies are transmitted is definitely crucial.\n    But the proposal of having a 'default currency' header is in my\n    opinion much too close to an actual specification (which we are\n    currently not chartered to do), and doesn't currently have enough\n    justification (e.g. saving bandwidth, simple interface with legacy\n    implementation,..., I'm just guessing).\n\n2.6 Locale Dependent Datatypes: I think this example should give\n    more motivation and detailled examples of where transmitting\n    locale-dependent representations is necessary (e.g. because\n    using a locale-independent representation may loose information).\n\nHope this is enough food for further discussion.\n\n\nRegards,     Martin.\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "All:\n\nThis really is an excellent document. Thanks again Kentaroh for your valuable contribution.\n\nMy comments on this draft:\n\nSection 2.2.2: We should note that xml:lang can also imply the language.\n\nIt should also be noted that human-readable messages (such as fault messages) often contain formatted substitution values (\"On {0,date} at {1, time} there were {2,number,integer} errors.\") that are locale affected. Neither xml:lang nor Accept-Language are entirely suitable for getting the formats of these values.\n\nSection 2.4.2: This isn't actually locale sensitive data. The currency type is loosely linked to a locale in most cases (that is, the country in many locales implies a currency), but the relationship is locale->currency and it is 1:[0..n], not 1:1 or 1:n. That is, a locale may not imply ANY currency. In addition, a currency may not imply a locale either (the Euro and USD span several locales, and some currencies like BEF may imply more than one language and hence locale).\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that if we're going to show \"locale sensitive data\", it should actually *take* a locale field and not some other value. I agree that 2.4.2 describes an internationalization problem. I'm just not sure it describes a locale problem. I think that there are very few examples of data structures that take a locale field (except for a locale, but that is solopsistic).\n\nAlso 2.4.2: Timezone requires more data in order to fully disambiguate. The GMT offset varies according to the daylight savings time rules (and thus the current date). It would be better to adopt the tz standard names as used by (for example) Java.\n\nFor similar comments, see: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-p3p-public-comments/2000Feb/0009.html.\n\nSection 2.5: I'm also not sure I agree with this concept. Sending picture strings is well-and-good if all clients are the same OS and programming language, but the semantics are bound to be difficult in this area. And it is more difficult to tell who's preferences should override the other. In Windows I can set quite detailed preferences for numeric display, for example. I would expect that a well-internationalized client might obey these settings to display XML data to me. Having the server create picture strings (for example) strikes me as quite problematic. This suggests that the server has to have specific client preferences, if I understand correctly.\n\nSection 2.6.2: I agree that this kind of operation requires special handling. Locale negotiation is necessary to enable locale-sensitive data exchange. I'm not sure I agree that we should enable locale-sensitive data fields, though. XML Schema date/time formats, for example, are capable of exchanging the raw date value and the local system has more information about things like calendar preference.\n\nThe problem here, for example, is that some systems (notably Java) do not have standard mechanisms for everything. Calendars are a good example. Japanese calendar. Islamic calendar. Any non-Gregorian Calendar isn't supported by Java directly (without a special library like ICU). This means that Kentaroh's example is a valid one: Japanese users may wish to have the server create that Heisei date string.\n\nSection 2.8 through 2.11. This describes various strategies for negotiating a locale between the sender and receiver.\n\nAs this email is getting long and I need to think about sections 2.8->2.11 carefully, I'll stop here.\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

Each of these\ncases is really quite different when looking at the issues in\nour context. The currency almost always has to travel with\nthe number itself (but not necessarily the currency formatting\ndetails). Date formatting is much more complex than simple number\nformatting.

Issue 263\nrelates to the language of SOAP Fault messages--the human readable text\nreturned by a Web service when there is an error.\n\nThe feeling of the task force members present was that the response of the\nXMLP group to this issue, while an improvement, was inadequate and\nunsatisfactory and it is our intention to frame some sort of response by the\ntime of our next (first) teleconference on 7 December. It is very important\nthat we respond to this issue quickly because of the fact that the SOAP 1.2\ncomment cycle nearing its end and the fact that the comments from XMLP-WG\nare becoming somewhat stale.\n\nThis particular issue is clearly an illustration of several specific issues\nnot currently in the Use Case document for which I drew the action item of\ncreating the scenarios. I will post my results to the lists at the same time\nthat I send them to our editor, Kentaroh, in order to speed up public\ncomment and to spur additional thought about this specific matter and\nadditional useful commentary.\n\nIn briefly reviewing my notes on this issue, I have enumerated for myself at\nleast five use scenarios only involving language selection in SOAP\nHeaderFault and SOAP Fault messages (!).\n\nAt the FTF, it was suggested that our reply to XMLP basically be along the\nlines of \"this is nice, but not enough\". The problem that we foresaw at the\nmeeting was that XMLP will require from us a specific solution for how to\nachieve language negotiation. The closest use scenario currently in our\nworking document is 2.9 (Locale Identification). The potential actions we\ncan take are:\n\n1. Do nothing. It is possible to consider language negotiation beyond the\nscope of the SOAP spec. Doing nothing in SOAP 1.2 would leave our Task Force\nfree to consider solutions and best practices at a later date.\n2. Recommend that XMLP add a requirement that each binding provide a\nspecific solution to language negotiation, but not specify the solution for\nany particular binding.\n3. Recommend that XMLP provide a specific solution that applies to all SOAP\ndocuments.\n\nI will post the use case scenarios on-line shortly. In the meantime,\nconsider how this issue should be addressed.\n\nOn a personal note, if we choose the third alternative, we had best be\nprepared to offer up the design for language negotiation in a SOAP document\nor XMLP will (rightfully) hand us our heads and ignore our suggestion.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

            "content": "Team,\n\nOne of the issues we reviewed in the WSTF face-to-face was the ugly Appendix B (app name to XML name mapping) section [1]. I had a hand in addressing previous versions of this awful, impenetrable text (see mail thread below).\n\nI would like to forward a more readable version to the XMLP editors. I composed one such on the flight home yesterday, which is between the --- lines in this message. Before I do that, I am offering an opportunity for review here. There are, no doubt, some issues with this text.\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part2.html#namemap\n\n----------------\n\nB. Mapping Application Defined Names to XML Names\n\nThis appendix details an algorithm for taking an application defined name, such as the name of a variable or field in a programming language, and mapping it to the Unicode characters that are legal in the names of XML elements and attributes as defined in [Namespaces in XML].\n\nHex Digits\n\n[5]    hexDigit    ::=    [0-9A-F]\n* Note, only uppercase letters A-F are defined here.\n\nB.1 Rules for mapping application defined names to XML Names\n\n1. An XML Name has two parts: Prefix and LocalPart. Let Prefix be determined per the rules and constraints specified in Namespaces in XML [Namespaces in XML]. The LocalPart will be determined by transforming the application name of the object as follows.\n\n2. Let \"T\" be the application name. \"T\" must be represented by a sequence of Unicode characters in Unicode Normalization Form C (NFC). Let \"M\" be the output of the algorithm, also as a sequence of Unicode characters.\n\nNote: If the name in the application is represented in some non-Unicode character encoding, it must be converted to Unicode before starting the name mapping process. Ideally any such conversion will use a reversable conversion (so that the original byte sequence can be obtained from the Unicode sequence), although this is not possible for some encodings.\n\nNote: Characters in the application name's original encoding that do not have a mapping to Unicode should be handled in some reasonable, application defined manner.\n\nNote: \"A sequence of Unicode characters\" means a sequence of code points (sometimes called Unicode Scalar Values). This should not be taken to imply that the characters are using any particular encoding of Unicode. The conversion algorithm itself may use whatever Unicode encoding is most convenient on that platform. However, it is important to note that surrogate pair sequences (pairs of UTF-16 code points that represent characters in Unicode above U+FFFF) must be handled as a single Unicode code point, rather than as the individual bytes or surrogate characters. Unpaired surrogates are not permitted.\n\n  That is, the UTF-16 sequence 0xD800 0xDC00 represents the Unicode character U+10000. When performing the following steps, the value U+10000 is considered to be a single Unicode character in the sequence T. \n\n3. Let \"i\" be an integer representing the current position in \"T\", T(i), with a starting value of 1, such that T(1) is the first character in T, T(2) is the second, and so forth. Let \"n\" represent the last position in T, T(n).\n\n4. Starting with 1, iterate across T by increasing i by 1 and perform the following evaluation on each character. \n\n   a. If T begins with the string \"xml\" (or any upper/lower case variation, such as \"xmL\", \"XML\", or \"xMl\"), encode T(1) using rule 4.c.i (that is, output either \"_x0078_\" for \"x\" or \"_x0058_\" for \"X\") and increase \"i\" to 4.\n\n   Note: if the sequence starts with \"xml\"/\"XML\"/\"xMl\"/etc., and is followed by a combining character, the combining character is not considered part of the letter \"l\" for processing purposes. By contrast, precomposed characters such as U+013B (Latin letter capital L with cedilla) do not trigger this rule. That is \"xm??\" is encoded as xm??, whereas xml(U+0300) is encoded as _x0078_ml_x0300_. [For reviewers, note that NFC means that these sequences will always evaluate identically.]\n\n   b. If T(i) falls in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF (that is, there is an unpaired surrogate character in the sequence), stop with an error.\n\n   c. Else if T(i) is not a valid XML NCName character (see [Namespaces in XML]) or if i=1 and T(i) is not a valid first character of an XML NCName (see [Namespaces in XML]) then:\n\n      i. If T(i) < 0x10000 and T(i) is not in the range 0xD800 through 0xDFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by four hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value followed by an underscore (\"_\") (for example, \"x\" (U+0078) would be encoded as \"_x0078_\").\n\n      ii. Else if T(i) > 0xFFFF, output to \"M\" the sequence \"_x\" followed by eight hexDigits representing the Unicode Scalar Value. For example, the character 0x10FFFE would be encoded as \"_x0010FFFE_\".\n\n   d. Else if T(i) = \"_\" (lowline) and T(i+1) = \"x\" or \"X\", output \"_x005F_\" to M.\n\n   e. Else output T(i) to M.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nHello world -> Hello_x0020_world  // space not permitted\nHello_xorld -> Hello_x005F_xorld  // _x rule\nHelloworld_ -> Helloworld_        \n\n          x -> x\n        xml -> _x0078_ml   // starts with xml\n       -xml -> _x002D_xml  // starts with hyphen-minus\n       x-ml -> x-ml        // not the string xml\n\n     ??lfred -> ??lfred\n   ???????????????? -> ????????????????\n????????????        -> _x1709__x1705__x170E__x1708_   // the Tagalog block is new and not permitted in XML 1.0\n?????????         -> _x13D9__x13DA__x13A5_  // The Cherokee block is new and not permitted in XML 1.0\n\nxml??moo -> _x0078_ml_x0300_moo  // Starts with \"xml\".

            "content": "Dear David and Hugo:\n\nRecently the W3C Internationalization Activity (W3C-I18N-WG) completed its rechartering effort. As you probably know, this working group supports the various W3C activities to make it possible to use Internet technologies worldwide.\n\nAs part of the rechartering, the I18N-WG has added two additional task forces concentrating on specific areas of immediate interest to the internationalization community. One of these is the Web Services I18N Task Force. I'm writing to you as the chair of this group to solicit your support and let you know about our activities.\n\nFor detailed information, you can view our public site here http://www.w3.org/International/ws. There is also a more detailed explanation of the task force in our new charter [1].\n\nWe are currently engaged in a Call for Participation. I would like to forward this call to the various WS-WG public lists in hopes of recruiting more members to support our activities. Our initial meetings include a Face-to-Face meeting in the Boston area November 22-23 and we'd like to have as many people on board by then as possible.\n\nThe Task Force has two main goals. \n\nOur short term goal is to produce a set of use cases that describe internationalization issues in web services. These documents will help identify i18n issues in Web services and also to provide templates for implementers to address these issues.\n\nOur second goal is to produce feedback (in the form of requirements) to the WS work groups to address any areas of concern that are identified. In this way we hope to support the actual WS working groups with the feedback and information they need to produce standards that will best serve international users.\n\nOf course we must closely coordinate our activities with those of the various working groups. As \"the other WS group\", we want to augment rather than detract from the efforts of the main WGs and by working closely together W3C-I18N and WS-CG can assure that this is the case.\n\nI'd like to suggest that we arrange a time to talk in the near future so that I can coordinate our calendar and activities with the various WG milestones and activities.\n\nI look forward to working closely with you in the future.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/2002/05/i18n-recharter/WG-charter#web-services\n\n\nAddison P.

            "content": "Gentlemen,\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to address your group directly. I look forward to working with each of you and the various Web services work groups in the future.\n\nSince our time was limited, I want to reiterate the main points so that there is no misunderstanding of our purposes:\n\n1. The I18N WS TF was started because of the level of interest in Web services from within the internationalization community in general. It is not, to my knowledge, anyone's opinion that \"you did something wrong\" or were singled out for our attention. It is merely that many of us are working on Web services and i18n at the same time and have an interest in promoting your activities and developing support for globalization capabilities in Web services.\n\n2. Our primary activity will be to develop use cases and requirements that demonstrate how Web services can be effectively used in an \"internationalized way\" and possibly to demonstrate where specific areas of improvement might be considered.\n\n3. We will also take an active role in reviewing standards as they are developed, in coordination with the I18N Core TF. By being more focused we feel we can improve the quality and timeliness of the i18n comments and feedback.\n\nAs we discussed, it is possible (even probable) that many of the \"i18n issues\" with Web services are actually more general issues with the base standards (like XML Schema, for example) that you rely on. In these instances, the WS TF will work towards promoting changes or additions to these standards to assist you in your goals.\n\nBecause our TF has yet to finish formalizing our structure, the specific \"hows\" and \"whats\" of our activity have yet to be fleshed out. Based on your recommendations, I will be contacting each of the WS working groups to solicit feedback on schedules, cooperation, and how we can best integrate our activities with those of the groups actively working on Web services.\n\nThanks again for the opportunity to meet with you. I recognize that your time is valuable. I look forward to sharing our activities with you in the future as best fits our two organizations.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

            "subject": "Pointers to a few WS document",
            "content": "Hi,\n\nThere are a few documents available in the webpages of various WS groups\nwhich probably need some clarifications or enhancements regarding\ninternationalization. I think we should review them as a group and convey\nour internationalization concerns and suggestions (if any) to the spec.\nleads.\n\n1.  XQuery  There are a few subtle internationalization issues associated\nwith XQuery. For example, the results of the queries corresponding to the\nrequirements 3.4.2 and 3.4.7 (of http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlquery-req) may get\ninfluenced by the locale. If the relevant XQuery gets executed in a remote\nnode, that service provider's locale may influence the query result.\nIdeally speaking, the query should be executed in the caller's locale to\nmaintain the remote-local transparency.\n\n            Also, the intent of Section 3.4.19 of the above mentioned\ndocument is not very clear to me. Is it implying that XQuery language MUST\nbe able to access the locale and time zone 'context' under which the\nrelevant query should get executed or something else? Some may consider\nSection 3.4.19 is alluding to remote-local transparency.\n\n2.  WS-I          The present version of the Basic Profile, Version 1.0 (\nhttp://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/Basic/2003-03/BasicProfile-1.0-BdAD.html) is\ncompletely silent about possible inter-operability issues regarding\ninternationalization. Section 4.1 (see also R1016) of the document provides\nexamples of SOAP 'faultString' (of SOAP 1.1 spec., which should be the\n'faultReason' of SOAP 1.2 spec.). The document should at least mention the\nproblem inherent in the present SOAP specifications about the selection of\nthe language/locale for the 'faultString'/'faultReason'; it may also\nprovide a reference to the appropriate sections of our use case document.\n\n3. WSRP     The Web Services for Remote Portlets Specifications, Working\nDraft 0.92  (\nhttp://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsrp) document\npaid a lot of attention to internationalization. quite a few data\nstructures contain 'locales', and 'LocalizedString' components. It seems\nthe spec. uses 'locales' as explicit parameter to API invocations; the WSDL\ndocuments of Section 14 are not available in OASIS web site, sigh!\n\nThis specifications probably demands closer scrutiny specially regarding\nthe following four points.\n\n3a.   The exact definition of 'locale' used in the spec. Apparently the\nspec. is using the RFC1766 language as 'locale' (see Sections 5.1.5,\n5.1.10, and footnotes 6 and 7).\n3b.   Section 5.1.22 mentions a problem similar to one of our use document.\nIf the 'desiredLocales' is empty or missing (is it optional?), the spec.\nmandates that all localized string be returned. This may not be possible in\nall installations.\n3c.   It seems that in this spec. the desired 'locale' is passed as an\nexplicit parameter. Probably 'context' is a better choice for conveying\nsystem-level environmental variables.\n3d.   Section 13 lists the 'faults' that can be generated from WSRP. Some\nfaults can have detailed messages associated with them (like\nInterface.OperationFailed).

Action Item Review\n>    - Tex: WSDL review\n\nTex: looking at WSDL. It Mentions URIs: need to understand if there is an IRI implication. Also need to think about aliasing of descriptive text or possibly service names for the purposes of searching. Tex will put some comments together by next meeting.\n\n>    - Deb: WS-Choroegraphy review\n\nin progress. next week: rough form of document.

Deb/Mike arranged to call each other offline to discuss in depth cooperation on this topic.\n\n>    - Addison: Post aggregation document\n\nin progress. move up to website this week.\n> \n> 2. Discuss I18N-WG coordination comments\n\nAP:   I'm concerned that we've fallen off schedule and had a period of low participation and lack of delivery. Solicits comments...\nTex:  Hit a period of lower participation due to very busy period. Interest remains high (general consensus)\nTex:  looking at spec size: plenty of work to do. Outside involvement might be too daunting to take on. We should persevere as a group and invite participation on an as-needed basis only.\nAP:   Should we consolidate our observations into best practices or more easily digested format? What goal do we wish to pursue?\n(General discussion): Want to publish something relevant based on Usage Scenarios and other work. Where should we try to publish this? Probably not worthwhile to go back to the IUC. Need to deliver documents that are relevant and well-constructed and we have a forum for that already. Good documents will drive interaction with other teams. Will also allow individuals to present materials and positions as they see fit.\nMD:   WWW-conference in < month, 1 session on WS. MD to speak and needs something to say...\nTex:  Do a presentation to clarify the significant scenarios. Here are some Scenarios. Here are a few issues within them of particular interest. Here are a few solutions or suggestions. Look for the compelling items.\n(Discussion)\n\nDecision: We need to edit and reorganize the Usage Scenarios document, creating summary blocks for the general types of issue or approach that we feel is significant. For example, the SOAPFault problem. The best way to do this is to edit the Usage scenarios document, adding any material we can gather quickly, and \"slide-ize\" the biggest (most interesting) items.\n\nPlan: Hold a mini-WSTF-FTF in the Boston area. We will try for 12/13 May. Addison, Tex, Martin. \n\nAddison will try to get webMethods office again.

            "subject": "FW: Lloyd's FAQ resurfaces (long",
            "content": "All:\n\nSomewhere under Richard's response below is my initial reaction to Lloyd's\nFAQ about Accept-Language (A-L) and Locale. I have a little heartburn about\nthe specific wording of this FAQ because I feel that it stresses the wrong\nthings about inferring locale from A-L.\n\nI have copied the WSTF list because our group is active in the area of\nlocales.\n\nI agree with nearly all of the detail in the FAQ, but not with the\npresentation.\n\nI would prefer it if the question were rephrased \"How can I obtain a locale\nfrom a browser (user-agent)? Can I get it from the Accept-Language?\" I would\nlike the answer to be \"Yes\", rather than (as it appears now) to be \"No\".\n\nI actually think that nearly all of the current draft is perfectly crafted\nand correct. The whole would be better, though, IMO, if it started with:\n\"Yes, but it is not a good idea to use HTTP Accept-Language\n<emph>alone</emph> to determine the locale preferences of the user.\"\n\nThe page should include reference to the fact that many Web servers, server\nside scripting languages, and operating environments, by default, parse and\ninfer their native locale objects from Accept-Language. For example, .NET\nuses the A-L to determine the default CultureInfo, Java Servlet provides a\ngetLocale() and getLocales() pair of methods that parse A-L, and so forth.\nThese objects are very useful in obtaining resources and other \"language\npreference\" material. They are less useful, as pointed out by the FAQ, in\ndetermining many of the fine grained attributes of users or in designing the\ninternational behavior of a site. A language preference of es-MX doesn't\nnecessarily mean that a postal address form should be formatted or validated\nfor Mexican addresses. I might still live in the USA (or elsewhere).\n\nThe rhetorical question \"Do you want to shove Polish content at a user just\nbecause they are running a user agent in Warsaw?\" might be answered yes in\nsome (many) cases. I think that the particular approach that a website takes\nwhen displaying the homepage depends on the application. If you don't have a\ncookie, logged in user, or other information about a request, it may\nactually be BETTER to follow what limited information you do have (including\nA-L) than ignore it. Do you want to shove French content at a user just\nbecause they haven't clicked on Polish yet? When all you have is an\nAccept-Language, what is your implementation decision?\n\nFinally, I think that the bulleted list at the bottom isn't all that\nappropriate. Of the items listed, only one (date/time formats) can and\nshould be wholly or partially inferred from a locale. The remainder\n(timezone, currency, measurement system, paper size, Tex's shoe/clothing\nsize, physical location) are all orthogonal or, at best, distantly related\nto locale systems. In proper international design, one would not necessarily\ninfer any of these from the user's concrete locale setting, let alone from\nA-L.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to comment.\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

You could, if you want, send these to public-i18n-geo@w3.org\nnow - I signed you up a few days ago.\n\nI guess what you're missing is some information: we do have John Yunker\nworking on more comprehensive guidelines for navigation (and he's quite\nkeen on this topic).  The guidelines are more appropriate for 'how to'\ntype of information such as you are suggesting.  Ideally that would\nexist already, and this FAQ would point to it, but one step at a time...\n\n> If A-L is good for content selection, why not locale selection?\n\nHmm. I'm wavering on this...  Maybe we should soften the text a little.\n\nSome of the points you make lower down (eg. Currency) would be worth\nsending to the geo list.

            "content": "The virus problems on the list ate my message...\n\nSo here it is again. Slight revision to it in case the first one eventually\nsurfaces on the list ;-).\n\nAddison\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Addison Phillips [wM] [mailto:aphillips@webmethods.com]\nSent: Wednesday, August 20, 2003 2:05 PM\nTo: public-i18n-geo@w3.org\nCc: public-i18n-ws@w3.org\nSubject: FW: Lloyd's FAQ resurfaces (long)\n\n\nAll:\n\nSomewhere under Richard's response below is my initial reaction to Lloyd's\nFAQ about Accept-Language (A-L) and Locale. I have copied the WSTF list\nbecause our group is active in the area of locales.\n\nI agree with nearly all of the detail in the FAQ, but not with the overall\npresentation. I would prefer if the question were rephrased \"How can I\nobtain a locale from a browser (user-agent)? Can I get it from the\nAccept-Language?\" I would like the answer to be \"Yes\", rather than (as it\nappears now) to be \"No\". My concern is that the emphasis is in the wrong\nplace. If you re-emphasize the first paragraph like the following, the point\nis clearer:\n\n\"Yes, but it is not a good idea to use HTTP Accept-Language\n<emph>alone</emph> to determine the locale preferences of the user.\"\n\nThe page should include reference to the fact that many Web servers, server\nside scripting languages, and operating environments, by default, parse and\ninfer their native locale objects from Accept-Language. For example, .NET\nuses the A-L to determine the default CultureInfo, Java Servlet provides a\ngetLocale() and getLocales() pair of methods that parse A-L, and so forth.\nThese objects are very useful in obtaining resources and other \"language\npreference\" material. They are less useful, as pointed out by the FAQ, in\ndetermining many of the fine grained attributes of users or in designing the\ninternational behavior of a site. A language preference of es-MX doesn't\nnecessarily mean that a postal address form should be formatted or validated\nfor Mexican addresses. The user might still live in the USA (or elsewhere).\n\nThe rhetorical question \"Do you want to shove Polish content at a user just\nbecause they are running a user agent in Warsaw?\" might be answered yes in\nsome (many) cases. I think that the particular approach that a website takes\nwhen displaying the homepage depends on the application. If you don't have a\ncookie, logged in user, or other information about a request, it may\nactually be BETTER to follow what limited information you do have (including\nA-L) than ignore it. Do you want to shove French content at a user just\nbecause they haven't clicked on Polish yet? When all you have is an\nAccept-Language, what should your implementation decision be?\n\nFinally, I think that the bulleted list at the bottom isn't all that\nappropriate. Of the items listed, only one (date/time formats) can be wholly\nor partially inferred from a locale. The remainder (timezone, currency,\nmeasurement system, paper size, Tex's shoe size, physical location) are all\northogonal or, at best, distantly related to locale systems. In proper\ninternational design, one would not necessarily infer any of these from the\nuser's concrete locale setting, let alone from A-L.\n\nThanks for the opportunity to comment.\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

You could, if you want, send these to public-i18n-geo@w3.org\nnow - I signed you up a few days ago.\n\nI guess what you're missing is some information: we do have John Yunker\nworking on more comprehensive guidelines for navigation (and he's quite\nkeen on this topic).  The guidelines are more appropriate for 'how to'\ntype of information such as you are suggesting.  Ideally that would\nexist already, and this FAQ would point to it, but one step at a time...\n\n> If A-L is good for content selection, why not locale selection?\n\nHmm. I'm wavering on this...  Maybe we should soften the text a little.\n\nSome of the points you make lower down (eg. Currency) would be worth\nsending to the geo list.  Would you like to do that, adapting the stuff\nrelating to how-to's in the light of my earlier comment?\n\nRI\n\n\n============\nRichard Ishida\nW3C\n\ncontact info: http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/geo/\n\nSee the W3C Internationalization FAQ page\nhttp://www.w3.org/International/questions.html\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Addison Phillips [wM] [mailto:aphillips@webmethods.com]\n> Sent: 19 August 2003 20:11\n> To: ishida@w3.org\n> Subject: RE: Lloyd's FAQ resurfaces\n>\n>\n> Gee... you're not going to like me any more...\n>\n> I don't like the flavor of this FAQ.

Its purpose is to give an overview of the\n    Christian, Hebrew, Persian, and Islamic calendars in common use. It\n    will provide a historical background for the Christian calendar,\n    plus an overview of the French Revolutionary calendar, the Maya\n    calendar, and the Chinese calendar.\n    (excellent resource!

He\n    recorded the birth of all his children according to the solar\n    calendar. This created problems for his second son, Tan Zheng, when\n    he applied for passport to come to India in the 1970s. The Hunan\n    passport office refused to believe that his date of birth was\n    recorded in the solar calendar, as he was born in 1932. It promptly\n    converted his solar birthday into another solar birthday. Few modern\n    Chinese could imagine that Tan Yun-shan did this in the early\n    decades of the century to his own birthday. One year, this 5th of\n    the 9th moon coincided with the 10th of October which was the\n    national day of the Republic of China. This gave him an occasion to\n    switch calendar. Henceforth, everyone easily remembered that he was\n    born on the \"Double 10th Festival\", forgetting the original date\n    recorded in the lunar calendar.\n\nhttp://www.archives.gov/facilities/ca/san_francisco/holdings_guide_04.html\n          Geneology and immigration documents - example would be \nservices that provide digital versions of documentation\n\nhttp://www.vn-tourism.com/english/what.htm\n\n    *Kate Festival *\n\n    This is the largest and the most joyful festival in Ninh Thuan and\n    Binh Thuan provinces, where live many Cham people. The ceremony\n    takes place at Poklong Giarai Tower, Po Rome Tower, Po Nagar Tower\n    Temple, from Sept.25th to Oct. 10th (on the 1st of July according to\n    the Cham calendar - corresponding to August or September by the\n    Lunar calendar).  ....\n\nCheers,\n\n       Mike____\n\nMark Davis wrote:\n\n>Yes, it is tricky.\n>\n>  \n>\n>>Alas xsd:date allows a timezone identifier...\n>>    \n>>\n>\n>An (optional) timezone identifier is actually reasonable.

Calendar-dependent events\n\nA Web service is set up to calculate a calendar date and send it back to\nthe requester.  The value returned represents a specific date on the calendar, \nnot a timestamp value as might be associated with a particular locale or\ntimezone.  The service may need to take in information such as the calendar \ntype, year, and related descriptive information.\n\nScenario A:  A service calculates the date for Easter, Passover, or Ramadan for \nany given year, returning a date value in {fill in the format, I don't know the \nright wording here}. These religious holidays are partly based\non astronomical events, such as lunar phases, as well as historical tables.\nThey are not strictly calendar dependent in the way that many secular holidays,\nsuch as various national independence days or leader's birthdays are, nor are \nthey predictable, for example, the fourth Thursday in November. Thus the need \nfor a service to calculate the date might be necessary.  The\nSOAP request would contain a holiday and a year in ISO 8601 format.  In \naddition, some other data may be required, such as for Easter there may be a \nparameter specifying \"Orthodox\" or \"Western\".  The Web service would in turn \ncalculate the appropriate date and send a message back to the requester with the\ncalculated date.  Some other service may be used to convert the returned date \nvalue into a specified calendar type, such as the Japanese calendar.\n\nScenario B:  A service calculates historical dates in different parts of\nthe world and returns an equivalent ISO 8601 date to the\nrequester.  The SOAP request would contain a date and its country of\norigin.  For example, a request might have the date 1812/08/26 and the\norigin \"Russia\".  Russia was using a different calendar from places such as\nItaly or France at that time; what would appear as the same date was actually \nseveral days off.  While this may look like it is part of the locale due to\nthe country of origin, it should not be treated as such.  Locales are\ntypically associated with the end user, not with a piece of data, and a\nlocale does not contain information on historical times.\n\nScenario C:  A service calculates Chinese New Year for any non-Chinese\ncalendar type.  The SOAP request would include a parameter with the\ncalendar type, such as \"Gregorian\", \"Hebrew\", or \"Japanese Imperial\".\nThe calendar type is again irrelevant to the locale, since the\nrequester may be looking for information unrelated to user preferences\nor system settings. {in light of all the comments, I have no idea what to do \nwith this scenario.  maybe we should replace it with Tex's scenario.}\n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Hi Mark,\n\nActually that's what I thought we were actually putting in our scenarios. The original scenario was to calculate certain religious holidays (that is, holidays that have non-trivial rules that require calculation or a table to discern), which is what you're saying. That is, not to compare different calendars, but to create xsd:date fields, in ISO8601 format, using the Gregorian Calendar, in SOAP documents conveying information about dates and times, and illustrating the \"range\" issue you wrote eloquently about earlier (and the considerations that developers might need to apply to working with human/calendar oriented dates vs. timestamps).\n\nOf course today's thread has mostly been in an ironic mode... I don't think the words \"dinosaur\", \"carbon-14\", or \"gondwanaland\" will appear in the usage scenarios anytime soon (except as a threat to errant developers: \"failing to internationalize your Web service will result in your being burnt to carbon and teleported back in time to dwell with the dinosaurs in Gondwanaland\"). Tex has suggested some additional, *different* scenarios involving calendric differences, mostly historical, which can be included in the document if he or someone else writes them up.\n\n... that said, putting my cajoling hat on and addressing the group: we need text for scenarios (preferably the planned ones first), rather than a discussion of whether to write text or not. Please follow Andrea's example and send scenarios (or other text for the missing sections of our document).\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\nAddison P.

It is much clearer to \nread it that way.  For example \"In the sections that follow, you will see the \nword \"locale\" used ...\" here \"locale\" is best italicized.  I don't recommend \nunderlining as it tends to be associated with links.  The quotes make it look \nlike it's a term only morons use or something, and we're referring to it just in \ncase it's the only way the concept can be understood.  This occurs for all sorts \nof words and phrases throughout the text.  Similarly, if we're trying to \nintroduce a key word or phrase, instead of surrounding it with quotation marks, \nit should be in bold, or bold italic, or even just italic.  I can go through an \nedit and do this, if you'd like.\n\nAlso, it would read much more easily if the parenthetical comments were limited. \n  Many could just be enclosed in commas.\n\n2.1 Basic Framework: Anatomy of a Web Service Interaction\n\nIn the diagram, the purple arrows don't appear to be discovery, they simply get \nor input the WSDL.  Of course, color is subjective, and one could call those \narrows \"fuchsia\" and call the discovery arrows \"purple\", but then that would \nleave no blue arrows.  Unless I'm misunderstanding the diagram?\n\n2.1.1 Discovery\n\n\"It may also contain contextual information, either required or options, \ngenerally contained in headers, such as the information required for \nquality-of-service, security, transactionality, and so forth.\"\n  - awk, how about:\n\"It may also contain required or optional contextual information for other areas \nof the service, such as quality-of-service, security, transactionality, and so \nforth.  This information is generally contained in headers.\"\n\n2.1.2 Request\n\n\"5. ... recognized, and valid for a service supported by the provider agent \n(e.g. it was not in error) ...\" - replace \"e.g.\" with \"i.e.\", if you want to \nknow why, ask.\n\n3.1 What is Internationalization?\n\n\"Internationalized software responds to changes in \"locale\" or other \ninternational preferences. Some examples of changes to behavior include:\"\n  - no list, the next text sequence is:\n\"There are many capabilities that internationalization might enable in a Web \nservice. Some of these preferences might include:\"\n- (the previous 2 sentences don't really go together)soooooooo, what are we \ntalking about here? Changes to behavior, or enabling preferences?  Or both, and \nthere's a missing list?\n\n3.2 What are Locales?\n\n\"The creation and translation of these materials into other languages is \ntypically called \"localization\" and this process is commonly confused with the \nbroader topic of internationalization.\"\n  - I would not call i18n a broader topic, as that implies that l10n is a subset \nof it.  How about:\n\"The creation and translation of these materials into other languages is \ntypically called \"localization\" and this process is commonly confused with \ninternationalization.\"\nWe've already defined i18n earlier in the document.

            "content": "Well, there are two issues here: terminology and contents.\n\nTerminology\n\nAs far as terminology goes, I believe it is very dangerous to use the\n'naked' term \"locale\", since the usage varies so widely. Even in your own\nmessages sometimes you appear to mean tags, sometimes data, sometimes\nconventions. And the meaning of a given message can vary widely depending on\nwhich interpretation the reader gives to it. This will only give rise to\nmisunderstandings on a very core issue.\n\nFor clarity, certainly in the working group discussion, we should always\nhave fully-qualified names, and say \"locale data\", or \"locale settings\",\netc. Otherwise we don't really know what we are agreeing or disagreeing on.\n\nContents.\n\nI have a certain amount of sympathy for the open-ended approach to locale\ntags. Having such a structure would allow people to interchange more\ninformation that is relevant to cultural expectations.\n\nAs in the example given earlier, I would like to be able to communicate the\nsettings that use en-US conventions typically, but then have a date format\nof \"yyyy.MM.dd\".\n\nBut such an open stucture still needs careful definition or else it is\nuseless (or worse) across different systems. This is tricky when faced with\nthe variation among different OSes and other systems. Take the subtag for\ncollation, for example. What are the values, and how is the standard\ndetermined? Even for *binary* unicode comparison there are two choices in\nuse: UTF-16 order and UTF-8 (= UTF-32) order. And when we get into\nlanguage-sensitive collation, which one is meant? Java's? Window's?\nSolaris's? Which version of that system?\n\nOr is it always a \"best effort\", and thus not consistent across platforms\n(or versions of the same platform)?\n\nI do see some relationship with what we are doing in terms of locale data\nfor the OpenI18n locale repository (currently hosted on the ICU site, but to\nmove soon), since it faces the same kinds of issues.\nhttp://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/locale/\nhttp://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/locale_data_markup.htm\nl\n\nMark\n________\nmark.davis@jtcsv.com\nIBM, MS 50-2/B11, 5600 Cottle Rd, SJ CA 95193\n(408) 256-3148\nfax: (408) 256-0799\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: \"Addison Phillips [wM]\" <aphillips@webmethods.com>\nTo: \"Mark Davis\" <mark.davis@jtcsv.com>\nCc: <public-i18n-ws@w3.org>\nSent: Friday, January 31, 2003 12:45\nSubject: RE: [I18N-WSTF] Teleconference Notes...\n\n\n>\n> There are fundamental problems in getting agreement on what a locale\nactually is.\n>\n> Personally, I fall most closely into camp #1 on your list. Although I\nacknowledge the other items there are completely valid, I think there is\nsome value for this group in taking a narrow view of what a locale is. My\nversion of #1 is:\n>\n> \"A locale is a collection of settings related to regional or cultural\npreferences. As a collection, it is an abstraction of a specific \"cultural\npreferences\" or \"regional settings\" for use by computer systems, not meant\nas a perfect model of an individual's preferences. Locales provide software\ndevelopers with the means of writing software that expresses itself in the\nmost appropriate way for a given set of users.\"\n>\n> Thus my preference for talking about \"locale tags\" or \"i18n context\nidentifiers\" instead of \"locales\". Once we start down the path of closely\ndefining a locale, we end up having to deal with the different locale models\nextant, the differing implementation details, dissatisfaction with the\nassumptions behind locales such as their lack of personalization, etc. Is\nthis necessary to create internationalized Web services? I don't believe it\nis.\n>\n> In fact, it might be counter-productive.\n>\n> Among the models for Web services platforms is the \"pure WS environment\",\nin which developers directly author Web services for the purpose of being a\nWeb service. It might be possible create and describe an \"Internet locale\nmodel\" that takes the full range of issues into account in this case.\n>\n> Another model is the \"wrapper\" model, in which Web service provider\nproducts wrap existing business logic in Web services. In this case I think\nit would be best that they way you author a \"Web service\" be analogous if\nnot identical to how you write \"regular\" logic. Or, another way: your\nregular logic will work as designed when you turn it into a WS.\n>\n> Thus, by ignoring what the \"locale container\" actually \"contains\", I think\nwe could create platform neutral \"locale and i18n preferences\" to enable\nmulti-locale support. More importantly, I think we could sell the result to\nWS standardizers and implementers who don't care what a locale is (or isn't)\nand have a vested interest in their existing systems (and locales).\n>\n> ~Addison\n>\n> NB> The foregoing is a personal view, not one currently endorsed by the\nWSTF.\n>\n> > -----Original Message-----\n> > From: Mark Davis [mailto:mark.davis@jtcsv.com]\n> > Sent: Friday, January 31, 2003 10:03 AM\n> > To: Addison Phillips [wM]\n> > Cc: public-i18n-ws@w3.org\n> > Subject: Re: [I18N-WSTF] Teleconference Notes...\n> >\n> >\n> > >Basically, the discussion revolved around the problem of passing\nlocales\n> > ...\n> > >What we're talking about here aren't locales, though, but locale tags\nor\n> >\n> > By the bare word \"locale\", people can mean *many* different things, as\nyou\n> > did so in your two recent messages.

The question\nis whether we can make a sensible compromise (something that meets some kind\nof need) or if charset negotiation is beyond the scope of our current\nefforts. I merely proposed it as \"one of the things we might need to\nexchange\". We should decide how to deal with it.\n\nIt may be that \"charset considered harmful\" would be a better focus for our\nefforts here. Another possibility would be to make a more definitive\nstatement about the use of Unicode in Web services. If Web services are to\ninsulate their callers from the implementation details of the back-end,\nthere should probably be a more definitive statement about how to do that.\nSort of a \"best practices when dealing with charsets\".\n\nIf we did it that way, the problems cited elsewhere would still exist, but\nthe solution would be implementation defined in a way that hides the details\nfrom \"public view\".\n\nIn any event, we need a) some usage scenarios to show what the problems\nmight be and b) some proposed requirements for dealing with it/them. If\ncontributors (including myself) can be found, then we can make progress on\nthis issue. Otherwise it is a random aside... but I suspect that this issue\nwill have to be dealt with at some point. Better for us to be prepared for\nit.\n\nthanks,\n\nAddison\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Mark Davis [mailto:mark.davis@jtcsv.com]\n> Sent: Monday, February 03, 2003 12:02 PM\n> To: Addison Phillips [wM]; Paul Deuter; Martin Duerst\n> Cc: public-i18n-ws@w3.org; debasish@us.ibm.com\n> Subject: Re: [WSTF] My view...

These are common \"patterns\" (in the technical/programming sense of \"pattern\", as well as the time-honored sense):\n\n1. Propagation (change in \"A\" also changes \"B\")\n2. Synchronization (change in either \"A\" or \"B\" changes the other also, as with \"single-view-of-customer\")\n3. Aggregation (changes in both/either \"A\" and \"B\" are reflected in \"C\")\n4. Sequential process (simple, step-by-step process, such as quote-to-order)\n5. Managed or transaction process(transactional process, with features like rollback)\n6. Invocation (RPC-like, also called Direct API Integration)\n7. Document exchange (B2B or EDI, for example)\n8. Shared process (two of #4 that talk to one-another)\n9. Federated query or notification (\"A\", \"B\", or \"C\" can query \"D\")\n\nNote that most Web services talk (and most of our discussions) hava centered on #6, but the most interesting problems are in the other patterns. Of course, there is no solution for i18n of #6 either ;-).\n\nI think if we were to document the patterns a little better we could write usage scenarios for each that would be more useful.\n\nAddison P.

The team did discuss error messages in general, but this conversation does not require specific review.\n\nb) Deb: Do we agree about the contents of an i18n context? In our discussion we decided that our immediate need is to create and consider usage scenarios that drive the requirements for this. In addition, we can go from requirements to scenarios (that is, create scenarios that illustrate what we feel the requirements are).\n\nc) We also discussed the need for WSArch to consider higher level requirements for contextual exchange and define the mechanisms. This discussion included further review of our own action plan. We need to return to gathering Usage Scenarios and developing Requirements. Focus needs to be put on developing these in a structured way so that they form \"packets\" of requirements and scenarios that can be targetted to different groups such as WSDL, SOAP, etc.\n\nd) Discussion: the W3C is a little slow in implementing basic standards. How do we get i18n issues considered in the adoption of recommendations? Some of us felt that the current methodology is not fast at developing basic \"foundational\" standards. We discussed that there is a tendency for complex specs (which need a larger investment from I18N-WSTF in evaluating than compared to simple or basic standards) to develop along lines of interest to the other WS work groups.\n\ne) Tex: the W3C could pay more attention to staffing up (i18n WG) to support this work.\n\nf) Addison: [action] Send integration patterns whitepaper link. Check ULocale paper link.\n\ng) Addison: [action] to do some patterns usage scenarios\n\nh) Martin/Addison: [action] mail Deb Mike's email address so that he can follow up on transaction scenarios\n\n\n\n"

My experience and my understanding\nof the interoperability problem is that\nUse of Unicode CAUSES the problem, rather than\nsolves the problem.\n\nBefore introduction of Unicode, the Japanese characters\nare transmitted in one of the three legacy encodings,\nShift_JIS, EUC-JP and ISO-2022-JP.  Because all of them\nare defined based on the base Japanese national\ncode sets, the conversion among them was well defined, and\nno character loss happens.  \n\nAfter introduction of Unicode, if we use a Unicode based\nencoding as transmission encoding between two systems\nwhich use the same or different legacy encodings, the data\nloss happens because of the incosistency in legacy-to-\nUnicode mappings between the two systems.\n\nUnicode enhances interoperability between the two\nencodings that share some characters, like between\nEUC-JP and EUC-KR, from 0% to some degree,\nbut it also reduces interoperability between the legacy\nencodings that shares the same base code sets,\nfrom 100% to 99.99%, in my opinion.\n\nSo I would like to propose to remove the phrase and\nthe sentence mentioned above, and add a note that\nwarns the interoperability issue.\n\n----\nT. \"Kuro\" Kurosaka, Internationalization Architect\nIONA Technologies, Santa Clara, CA USA / +1 408 350-9684 \n\n\n\n"

            "content": "While reviewing the WS i18n usage scinario document, I have\nnoticed that there is a semantic difference between XML and HTML\nlanguage specs.\n\nIn section 8.1 of HTML 4.01 spec at\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1\nthere is an example that reads:\n<P><Q lang=\"en\">Her super-powers were the result of\n&gamma;-radiation,</Q> he explained.</P>\n\nand:\n<HTML lang=\"fr\">\n<BODY>\n...Interpreted as French...\n<P lang=\"es\">...Interpreted as Spanish...\n<P>...Interpreted as French again...\n<P>...French text interrupted by<EM lang=\"ja\">some\n         Japanese</EM>French begins here again...\n</BODY>\n\nFrom these examples and explanaition, the lang\nattribute just aids the client system to do a better job by\ngiving it a \"hint\".

            "content": "Team:\n\nThank you for a productive and lively call today. Here are my notes, somewhat cleaned up and \"clarified\"\n\n~Addison\n\nMeeting notes, 7 January\n--\nPresent: Addison (chair, scribe), Kuro (IONA), Kentaroh, Deb, Martin, Tex\n\nRegrets: Takao, Mike\n--\nAction Items:\n\n1. Martin: will follow up with Russ Rolfe in case MS has any space in Prague for an FTF. This is a low priority item.\n2. Team: write up and send to list a \"position\" on the locale problem (See notes below for what that means). Due prior to next meeting.\n3. Deb: send specific comments on WSUS to list.\n4. Addison: post tentative calendar of activities for year.\n\n--\nAgenda Items:\n\n1. Discussed FTF. May just need to schedule one separately from other activities (e.g. maybe not at an IUC). We agreed to further study the FTF *after* we have a better understanding of upcoming activity. Note that we need at least 8 weeks of advance notice on an FTF, so this needs to happen quickly. It is likely that we will have enough information to decide this at the next meeting.\n\n2. Need to extend the extant use cases to be more complete. Some of the use cases are too skeletal to understand. This is a lower priority item, but contributors of scenarios should take a look over their cases and flesh out if necessary.\n\n3. Discuss if we should we merge language and locale negotiation categories in triage table. General agreement that this should be done.\n\n4. Categories: \"best practices\" vs. \"best problems\"? Suggestion that we need to get more coverage for neglected areas, that we need to more \"orthogonally\" define the triage categories, and that we need to do more research to achieve \"total coverage\". Also agreed that some of the \"best practices/implementation guidelines\" items describe well-known or well-understood problems that have concrete solutions and that some merely describe areas where more works needs doing or for which there are not well-understood solutions.\n\n   4a. Discussed the categories themselves. Dissatisfaction with them as is was expressed. They don't cover the requirements areas neatly and there is a lot of crossover. Concern that \"implementation guidelines\" is an inaccurate title, since these aren't really guidelines.\n\n5. Discussed potential need to be more methodical about finding issues. Maybe look at structure of WS and WS architecture documents. Discussed how to get a more representative collection of use scenarios and whether this should be our next focused activity. Ultimately rejected spending time trying to get \"total coverage\" in order to focus in a single area (locales: see below).\n\n6. Discussed the fact that WSUS drives requirements. Need to find out root problems, collect requirements, and then pursue solutions. This may include working on other team's Recommendation documents (e.g. SOAP/XMLP, WSDL, WSArch, etc.) or it may include developing our own Recommendation(s) as appropriate.\n\n7. Discussed the idea that we need to make a blueprint from WS Arch document or some other \"armiture\" to better describe the coverage that WSUS provides.\n\n8. Decided to focus our activities on the language/locale/i18n-context negotiation problem. This was cited as the most pressing and obvious area of difficulty (and of the most interest to the community). By focusing on this activity we can ensure that we make forward progress without getting lost in the vast possibilities that WS provides.\n\n9. In order to proceed, decided that we need to establish the requirements in this area. Deb, Addison, others volunteered to produce \"point of view\" (POV) documents that establish the problem domain and suggest solutions. By doing this we hope to identify the \"commonality\" amoung the various usage scenarios and define our activities. Agreed that we would each attempt to produce our POV as far in advance of our next meeting (21 january) as possible.\n\n--\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: public-i18n-ws-request@w3.org\n> [mailto:public-i18n-ws-request@w3.org]On Behalf Of Addison Phillips [wM]\n> Sent: Monday, January 06, 2003 11:26 AM\n> To: public-i18n-ws@w3.org\n> Subject: [I18N-WSTF] Reminder: Teleconference TOMORROW\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> W3C-I18N-WG Web Services TF teleconference [WSTF]\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> Bridge   : +1-617-761-6200 (Zakim) with conference code 4186 \n> (spells \"I18N\")\n> Duration : 60 minutes\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> SCHEDULE CHANGED FOR NEW YEAR!!!\n> Day      : Tuesday\n> Dates    : 7, 21 January & 4, 18 February\n> Start    : 23:00 GMT, 18:00 Eastern, 15:00 Pacific, 08:00 Tokyo \n> (next day!)\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------\n> -----------\n> Zakim information    : http://www.w3.org/2002/01/UsingZakim\n> Zakim bridge monitor : http://www.w3.org/1998/12/bridge/Zakim.html\n> Zakim IRC bot        : http://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot.html\n> Zakim Calendar entry : \nhttp://www.w3.org/Guide/1998/08/teleconference-calendar#s_731\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREMINDER: the next scheduled teleconference for the WSTF is tomorrow.

            "subject": "[WSTF] My view... [long",
            "content": "Folks:\n\nThis email outlines my approach to the locale/language issue we discussed in the last telecon. It is somewhat long.\n\nI consider \"locale\" to be an environment setting or settings that govern how data is (to be) processed. Language preference may either be an aspect of \"locale\" or may be a separate environment setting. There are cases (described below) in which the locale is also a data element which is part of the processing, but this is a special case and I think it is important to deal with it as such.\n\nIn traditional software, the developer doesn't need to explicitly obtain a Locale object or setting in order to write internationalized code. The default behavior of locale-aware functions obtain and use the locale from the system environment. Yes, the developer must call the correct functions or methods, but s/he must only obtain a locale when the desire is to override the user's preference (the default).\n\nA notable failing of enterprise and client-server architectures has been the failure to simulate this relationship and provide multi-locale support, that is, a server that can process data for clients running in different locales at the same time. Well-designed \"ML\" client-server systems negotiate the locale for each client session with the server and the server tracks and processes data with the client's preferences.\n\nWeb services are a form of client-server architecture in which the \"Web service container\" calls a function or method for the \"client\". There is a \"service description\" (WSDL file) that describes to the client what data to pass, where the container server is, what protocol(s) to use, and so forth. The client uses the service description to build a SOAP document containing the necessary fields (required and optional) and sends it to the container, which invokes the actual service with the data.\n\nIf there is a failure, a SOAP fault is sent to the client. The failure can be in either the container or in the service itself. Depending on the nature of the service, the container may or may not return a SOAP document with data or a result.\n\nNow the problems here are:\n\n1. When designing the actual service (the underlying method or function), the developer should not need to deviate from standard i18n practices. If the service's data model doesn't require a locale, then the developer shouldn't have to artificially provide one just to internationalize the service. Consider a Java method that adds to integers together:\n\n  public int addInts(int var1, int var2)\n\nThe method is not locale affected, nor does it take or return any locale affected data types or values. However, the method may return an error message (\"loss of precision\" or \"integer overflow\", for example), so it needs to provide for localization. It is unnatural to force the developer to specify the method as:\n\n  public int addInts(int var1, int var2, Locale userLocale)\n\nThe Web service container should provide this functionality.\n\n2. When generating WSDL for a service (as part of deploying the service), a multi-locale enabled container may add its own proprietary header value that allows the client to specify the execution locale. Since the extension is proprietary, it may not be possible for the client to accurately provide a suitable value to the container. Likewise, the client may not be able to interpret the results. Consider some WSDL generated by the product I was using at the FTF. As a Java product, it rendered java.util.Locale objects by using the constructor that takes three strings: \"language\", \"region\", \"variant\". How would a C#, C++, or perl program invoke this service accurately?\n\nIn other words, a proprietary solution may not be interoperable and may expose the implementation to readily.\n\n3. If the service container generates its own header, this may conflict with a service that reasonably does require a Locale argument to invoke it. Consider this Java service:\n\n   public int compareString(String var1, String var2, Locale userLocale)\n\nThe userLocale allows the client to override the default locale to get the result. If the container also generates a proprietary header, the client may have a hard time implementing the service correctly. And the semantics may vary for \"locale\".\n\n4. If the service is not internationalized or has limitations on its invocation (consider many legacy host systems), there is no way to tell how the service was actually executed or to know about these limitations.\n---\nAside: These last two scenarios Deb described in an off-list email last week. These are \"runAsClient\", \"runAsSpecified\" and \"runAsServer\" scenarios, Deb.\n---\n\nIMHO, the \"big picture\" (requirements) here are:\n\n1. Web services needs a non-proprietary negotiation mechanism for locale and language preference.\n2. The mechanism should be based on locale tags or an XML \"locale\" or \"i18n context\" data structure that is platform neutral.\n3. The mechanism should be part of the service invocation context (e.g. in the header or envelope, not the payload or body). Implementers should create APIs and runtimes that use this as intended (described above), but non-i18n implementations will merely ignore it or get locale-of-the-server.\n4. Services that need a locale \"object\" may use the tags/structure in the body (e.g. in the service's \"contract\") to pass locale information. Developers can thus provide \"i18n demo\" services ;-).\n5. The mechanism must be able to deal with both client preference (\"Accept-Locale\") and server capability (\"Content-Locale\"). It must have an analog for the \"null\" (neutral, POSIX, C) locale.\n6. Web services providers and client vendors should be able to count on this mechanism being available and invoke services with it without knowing if the back-end system can service their requests. This is a way of saying this is not \"mustUnderstand\", I guess.\n\nI'm on record as favoring tags over an XML structure, but I'm willing to be persuaded (and try persuasion ;-)). I have use cases galore from webMethods that relate to the various aspects of the above.\n\nSome things to think about:\n\n--RFC3066 language tags (that is xx-YY) are sufficient for identifying Java locales and possibly C# CultureInfos, but not for POSIX, C/C++, Mac, and other native programming environments.\n\n--There is bound to be confusion about language (\"Accept-Language\") and locale.\n\nI have lots more to say, but let's start with this. Is this an accurate description of what our requirements should be? How can I flesh out the problems better?\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAddison\n\nAddison P.

            "subject": "Re: [WSTF] My view... [long",
            "content": "Addison,\n\nThanks for drafting out a very nice initial requirement document.\n\nI have certain general comments and questions related to your document.\nSome of the comments in terse forms may be considered as candidates for\ninclusion in your list of requirements.\n\n1.  Do we have to treat 'language' and 'locale' separately? As you very\nmentioned, this can generate unnecessary confusion. Can we consider\n'language' to be an optional part of a 'locale'?\n\n2.  Instead of terms like \"Accept-Language', 'Accept-Locale',\n'Content-Locale', I prefer the use of the term 'Internationalization\nContext'. A 'context' is (a) system level information, and (b)\ntransparently provided and managed by middleware infrastructure. A\nsystem-level data should not appear in any application-level method or\noperation signatures. To maintain remote-local transparency in distributed\nheterogeneous managed environments we need to use contextual system-level\ninformation containing locale(s), etc. I view this particular category of\ncontextual information as the 'Internationalization Context'.\n\nNote that in your example of \"addInts(...)\" we are actually using\n'internationalization context', which is transparently propagated, managed,\nand made available (using APIs) by the so called \"Web service\ncontainer'--the middleware.\n\nI believe, there is no need to deviate from the principle of 'not exposing\nany contextual information in method signatures' in your \"compareStrings()\"\nexample. That 'userLocale' parameter in this particular example should also\nbe viewed as an implicit parameter derived from the 'invocation\ninternationalization context'.\n\nIncidentally, your \"compareStrings()\" example highlights the 'life-cycle\nmanagement' policy for internationalization context. The\ninternationalization context probably has the shortest life-cycle span when\ncompared to other contexts. Within a user 'session', the\ninternationalization context can potentially be different during each\ninteraction with the Web service.\n\n3.  Whether contexts will be carried in headers (for SOAP) or trailers (for\nXYZ protocol) is an issue related to binding. First we need a formalism to\nexpress contextual information in WSDL fundamental entities like\n'serviceType', 'portType' etc. WSDL binding specifications can then define\nthe exact mechanisms for propagating various contextual information\nincluding our internationalization context. For SOAP-binding of WSDL,\ncertainly all the contextual information should be carried in SOAP headers.\n\n4.  We may need to express the management policies and attributes related\nto 'invocation internationalization context' (and in general for other\ntypes of contexts too) at various levels of granularity in WSDL\ndescriptions. The default management policy for internationalization\ncontext must be 'runAsCaller'.\n\nAll the management policies are to be enforced by Web service containers.\nFor container-managed instances, a Web service programmer should not able\nto change the internationalization context programmatically. In isolated\ninstances though, a Web service developer may want to exercise complete\nprogrammatic control over the invocation internationalization context for\none or more components. The WSDL of those components can be associated with\nsomething like \"Application Managed Internationalization\" policy.\n\nThe management policy (container-managed internationalization or\napplication-managed internationalization) and attributes (runAsCaller,\nrunAsServer, runAsSpecified) can be specified at various levels at WSDL\ncomponents. WSDL need to define how the policy specified at a higher level\nentity (say associated with a portType pT) affects the policy at a related\nlower level entity (say operation oP contained within pT).\n\nThe management policy and attributes should be made available at Web\nservice discovery namespaces like UDDI. An Web service client should be\nable to browse UDDI namespace and base its selection of a Web Service using\nits internationalization context (probably along with other contexts too)\nmanagement policy and attributes. Certainly for a general Web service\nclient, the 'runAsCaller' deployment attribute of a web service W1 promises\nmore towards distributed localization when compared with 'runAsServer'\nattribute for a similar Web service W2. If all other factors are the same,\nthe Web service requester may select W1 for its superior\ninternationalization capability.\n\n5. Do you think that 'time zone' should also be a part of\ninternationalization context? This is a very sensitive question. I know for\nsure that some distributed architectures are already frustrated with the\nDaylight Savings business and are embracing UTC. Still for user's\nconvenience, shall we propose to carry the time zone information along with\nlocale(s) in internationalization context? UTC-oriented Web service\ncomponents may simply ignore the time zone present in internationalization\ncontext.\n\n6.  To my knowledge there is no standard definition of locale. The\nRFC3066-type tags is probably suitable for modern programming environments\nlike Java,  C#, ICU, or the ANSI C++ library (I am not too sure about it, I\nhave to double check). POSIX, and XPG4 (the classical C and C++\ninternationalization environment) can not natively provide a multi-locale\nenabled (ML) environment anyway. I do not know about native Macintosh\nenvironment. Can a native Macintosh programming environment be ML enabled?\n\nFor systems which do not recognize RFC3066-type tags, can we go for\npluggable adapters? For interoperability, the adapters will be used by Web\nservice containers for converting (often approximately) RFC3066 type of\nlocale data to the native locale and back.\n\nI guess we can discuss these and other issues in our next teleconference.\n\nThanks,\n\nDeb\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                     \n                      \"Addison Phillips                                                                                                              \n                      [wM]\"                     To:       <public-i18n-ws@w3.org>                                                                    \n                      <aphillips@webmeth        cc:       Debasish Banerjee/Rochester/IBM@IBMUS                                                      \n                      ods.com>                  Subject:  [WSTF] My view...

Do we have to treat 'language' and 'locale' separately? As you very\n> mentioned, this can generate unnecessary confusion. Can we consider\n> 'language' to be an optional part of a 'locale'?\n\nYes, from the point of view that language is an aspect of locale. However,\nthere are two arguments for keeping language preference separate:\n\n1. Language negotiation mechanisms already exist and are fully documented. A\nnew locale negotiation mechanism must co-exist with these language\nmechanisms. Therefore, although locale contains a language preference, we\nneed to say how that overrides or is overridden by the language mechanisms.\n\n2. Some folks (not necessarily me) think that language negotation should be\nkept entirely separate from processing locale.\n>\n> 2.  Instead of terms like \"Accept-Language', 'Accept-Locale',\n> 'Content-Locale', I prefer the use of the term 'Internationalization\n> Context'. A 'context' is (a) system level information, and (b)\n> transparently provided and managed by middleware infrastructure. A\n> system-level data should not appear in any application-level method or\n> operation signatures. To maintain remote-local transparency in distributed\n> heterogeneous managed environments we need to use contextual system-level\n> information containing locale(s), etc. I view this particular category of\n> contextual information as the 'Internationalization Context'.\n\nAgreed, but I used this shorthand to draw a parallel with existing HTTP\nprotocol, which others seem to understand readily.\n\n>\n> Note that in your example of \"addInts(...)\" we are actually using\n> 'internationalization context', which is transparently\n> propagated, managed,\n> and made available (using APIs) by the so called \"Web service\n> container'--the middleware.\n\nI think that was my point when I said \"It is unnatural to force the\ndeveloper to specify the method as:\", that in normal programming you do NOT\nwant to clutter things up with extra locale objects all over everywhere. You\nonly want to declare a locale object when you normally would declare one\n(that is, the locale is actually significant for your data structure or\nprocess)\n\nFor WS tools that take existing code and \"web service-ize\" it, this makes a\nlot of sense: you don't have to rewrite the code. For WS authoring tools\n(e.g. you write the method as a Web service ab initio), it promotes a clean\npractice that is easily understood.\n\n>\n> I believe, there is no need to deviate from the principle of 'not exposing\n> any contextual information in method signatures' in your\n> \"compareStrings()\"\n> example. That 'userLocale' parameter in this particular example\n> should also\n> be viewed as an implicit parameter derived from the 'invocation\n> internationalization context'.\n\nThere is no need, you're right, as long as you want to write a service that\nuses the \"user's default locale\" to perform the process. By contrast, one\nmight wish to write a locale-affected service and let the user override the\nlocale. Perhaps compareStrings is a poor choice. Maybe a more complex\nexample is called for. Say \"localeAffectedAddInts\" which takes two\nlocale-formatted strings? I don't know off-hand, but my point was that IF\nthe developer makes a design time decision to provide a locale as part of\nthe interface, THEN it is for the express purpose of overriding the default\nuser locale.\n\nIt puts the locale in the service's \"contract\" so that there is no guesswork\nabout what the service is doing.\n\nIn webMethods tools, for example, we actually have special locale values for\n\"user\", \"server\", \"null\" (locale-neutral, like C or POSIX locale), and so\nforth, that can be applied to pass the context value to a service that takes\nan explicit locale argument (that is, so you don't have to specify the\nuser's locale, for example, at design time, you just get it from the\nservice's \"InvokeState\"). This is DIFFERENT than a service that takes no\nexplicit locale argument and just uses its invocation state/i18n context to\nhandle problems like resource management and the like.\n\n>\n> Incidentally, your \"compareStrings()\" example highlights the 'life-cycle\n> management' policy for internationalization context.

Within a user 'session', the\n> internationalization context can potentially be different during each\n> interaction with the Web service.\n\nHm... each interaction with a Web service is a separate session anyway,\nunless you use something like the EWS framework. Even in the context of\n\"service flows\" (like orchestrated with BPEL4WS or whatever), each service\nis separately invoked and has its own i18n context.\n\nNote that in terms of \"larger orchestration\" of Web services, you probably\na) want a consistent user context and b) most Web service \"client\" systems\nwill probably be reading the value from the operating environment or some\nstatic configuration anyway... ;-)\n>\n> 3.

My concern is whether we are JUST doing SOAP, or whether the scope\ngoes all the way to, say, HTTP human-interactive (or somewhere in the\nmiddle.......)\n\n>\n> 4.

The default management policy for internationalization\n> context must be 'runAsCaller'.\n\nI disagree. For >>International aware<< systems, yes, that would be the\ncase. But the default now is UNaware systems and these will default to\n'runAsServer'. Hence, I think the default is 'runAsServer' unless the\ncontainer a) supports the i18n context and b) you send it one.\n\n>\n> All the management policies are to be enforced by Web service containers.\n> For container-managed instances, a Web service programmer should not able\n> to change the internationalization context programmatically.

However, the programmer may 'ignore' the\ncontext and use another explicit value in written code. Or the service may\noverride the value when invoking other services or in the return values. The\nnature of Web services, though, suggests that this isn't much of an issue.\nThe next SOAP document received begins a new transaction or, at least,\ninteraction in the sequence of transactions and it can, of course, have an\ni18n context of its own.\n\n>\n> The management policy (container-managed internationalization or\n> application-managed internationalization) and attributes (runAsCaller,\n> runAsServer, runAsSpecified) can be specified at various levels at WSDL\n> components. WSDL need to define how the policy specified at a higher level\n> entity (say associated with a portType pT) affects the policy at a related\n> lower level entity (say operation oP contained within pT).\n\nGenerally the policy and attributes are intrinsically related to the actual\nservice's implementation. For the non-WS folks: a \"portType\" in WSDL is a\ncollection of \"operations\". An \"operation\" is a sequence of inputs (receive\nSOAP doc) and outputs (send SOAP doc). A \"binding\" associates a \"portType\"\nwith a specific transport protocol.\n\nI agree that these details need careful thought through. Part of me is of\nthe opinion that i18n attributes might occur down at the \"message\" level,\nsince that is generally closest to the the actual method implementation. The\ncontext exchange itself would be defined at a higher level, perhaps.\nConsider:\n\n        <wsdl:message name=\"addIntsInput\">\n                <wsdl:part name=\"var1\" type=\"xsd:integer\"/>\n                <wsdl:part name=\"var2\" type=\"xsd:integer\"/>\n                <i18n:policy value=\"runAsCaller\"/>\n        </wsdl:message>\n\n>\n> The management policy and attributes should be made available at Web\n> service discovery namespaces like UDDI.

If all other factors are the same,\n> the Web service requester may select W1 for its superior\n> internationalization capability.\n\nI somehow doubt it. What's more interesting at the UDDI level is whether the\nservice is \"available in my language\", has a description \"in my language\",\nand offers processing that is useful to me in my locale or context. A Web\nservice that runsAsCaller but returns everything in Chinese is less useful\nto me than one that is hard coded to return English---but only because I\ndon't speak Chinese, eh?\n\nI think it more likely that users will want a different quality of\ninformation about Web services in registries.\n\n>\n> 5. Do you think that 'time zone' should also be a part of\n> internationalization context? This is a very sensitive question.\n> I know for\n> sure that some distributed architectures are already frustrated with the\n> Daylight Savings business and are embracing UTC. Still for user's\n> convenience, shall we propose to carry the time zone information\n> along with\n> locale(s) in internationalization context? UTC-oriented Web service\n> components may simply ignore the time zone present in internationalization\n> context.\n\nNo, I don't. Although I have invested significant time in TZs of late.\nHeaven knows that there are few corners of i18n that confuse developers more\nthan how to deal with TZ!!\n\nAt issue here is that transporting \"zone affected\" dates and times is just\nabout like transporting \"locale affected\" data formats. You wouldn't send\n\"1.234,45\" as a number. Sending \"18:35\" as a time is just as bad.\n\nDates and times in WS should use the ISO8601 (explicit, Gregorian, long)\nformats wherever possible. Ideally, we would have millis-since-epoch-UTC\nlike java.util.Date, but I digress.\n\nTelling me your time zone does no good. I don't want to perform costly, time\nconsuming conversions when xsd provides explicit formats and let's you deal\nwith problems like DST changes.\n\nOkay, I can see how some systems might require TZ to be complete and TZ is\northogonal to locale, so if we are going to communicate using TZ affected\nformats, we need a separate data field.\n\n>\n> 6.  To my knowledge there is no standard definition of locale.

I do not know about native Macintosh\n> environment. Can a native Macintosh programming environment be ML enabled?\n\nNope. There is no standard definition. RFC3066 is actually something I'm\nwary of, since it invites the confusion with language tags (already a mire\nof confusion). Most modern programming environments, such as those cited,\ncan get by or do something meaningful with 3066 tags, but there are all of\nthese annoying exceptions for each one.\n\n>\n> For systems which do not recognize RFC3066-type tags, can we go for\n> pluggable adapters?

I suppose. But I think some\neffort should go into allowing the extra, non-3066 information to flow along\nwithout getting lost.
