(This changes when images become a -requirement for accessibility-.) \nYou do bring up a good point, however, that many people who can see are also not \"visually capable\" and may not be able to provide graphics easily.

These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way. For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process. These insure a sensible flow chart... at least a chart that \"parses\" correctly. On the other hand, I've seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they're using.I'll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day. \nOther examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set. \nAlso, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards. \nNow, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can't be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules? Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines: we're just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that.
