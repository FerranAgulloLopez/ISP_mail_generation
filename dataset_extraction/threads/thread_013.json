This will give an example from a real web server (I would include\nan example in this message, but a multi-chunk message would be too large).\nAlso, have you read the section of the HTTP/1.1 RFC on chunked transfer\nencoding?  It's basically just a hex number (chunk length), newline,\ncontent, another hex number (another chunk length), another newline,\ncontent, then a 0 after the last chunk.  There are optional headers that may\nbe in there too, so check the RFC to get the full details and some\nimlementations like to add superfluous characters (spaces) after the chunk\nlength and before the newline.\n\nAlso, as a response to earlier messages as to why to avoid chunked transfer\nencoding--it's simple, chunked transfer encoding is needlessly complicated,\nand is not even needed for persitent connections.  HTTP/1.0 supports\npersistent connections with the \"Connection\" field set at \"Keep-Alive\" and\nby using the \"Content-Length\" field to specify the file boundry.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0170226"}, {"subject": "re: problem with chunked encoding in http1.", "content": "Ignore the second part of the last message, I didn't read the full response\nin one of the e-mails.

Proxies commonly don't support incomming FTP connections.\nYou can access FTP through HTTP, even through the protocols differ.\n\nSMTP is not comparable with HTTP in any kind. It handles mail transmission\ninstead of file/hypertext transport.\n\nSOCKS is not comparable with HTTP in any kind. It's designed for incomming\nand outgoing TCP and UDP traffic through a firewall.\n\nThese protocols are for very different different goals than HTTP is.\n\n>Why not other protocols are tunneled over HTTP?\n\nIt's not practical. And also security may suffer.\nICQ, for example does support tunneling through HTTP, however I doubt it's\nused frequently. SOCKS is a better alternative for this...\n\n>\n>If my application (written in say VC++), wants to use HTTP-tunneling\n>what necessary and sufficient conditions it should have at\n>Client and Server\n>ends.\n\nHTTP tunneling supports only TCP outgoing, however SOCKS support TCP and UDP\nincomming and outgoing, even as knowing the IP address and port where that\nis opened for transactions.\n>\n>There is still confusion on PROXING and HTTP-TUNNELING.\n>If HTTPS uses HTTP-TUNNELING and HTTP-TUNNELED data cant be\n>seen by anybody,\n>why encryption is needed for that data (Digital certificates\n>for HTTPS)?\n\nYou make a TCP connection to the proxy and request the proxy to make a\ntunnel to a server. The data send through the HTTP tunnel (like most(!)\ntunnels) can be read by everyone. A protocol like SSL or TLS adds the\nsecurity (others cannot write and optionally not read). Over a security\nprotocol HTTP is send.\n\nHTTPS is simply HTTP send over a security protocol, like SSL, TLS or others.\n\n\n- Joris\n>\n>Thanks in advance.\n>\n>Yog\n>\n>> -----Original Message-----\n>> From: Joris Dobbelsteen [mailto:joris.dobbelsteen@mail.com]\n>> Sent: Thursday, August 30, 2001 2:54 PM\n>> To: 'Rompo Punyanitya'\n>> Cc: WWW WG (E-mail)\n>> Subject: RE: Http Tunneling\n>>\n>>\n>> >-----Original Message-----\n>> >From: Rompo Punyanitya [mailto:rpunyani@bigpond.net.au]\n>> >Sent: Wednesday, 29 August 2001 11:46\n>> >To: Joris Dobbelsteen\n>> >Subject: Re: Http Tunneling\n>> >\n>> >  Doesn't it mean that HTTP tunneling is also act and serve the same\n>> >functionalities as HTTP proxy then?

For example, a client might have started to send a new request\n   at the same time that the server has decided to close the \"idle\"\n   connection. From the server's point of view, the connection is being\n   closed while it was idle, but from the client's point of view, a\n   request is in progress.\n\n   This means that clients, servers, and proxies MUST be able to recover\n   from asynchronous close events.\n\nThe use of \"Connection: close\" is a SHOULD-level requirement in the\ncase where \"the server chooses to close the connection immediately\nafter sending the response\" (section 8.1.2.1), but since you say that\nthe server in your case is waiting 0.5 seconds, it's hard to say if\nthis is really \"immediately\" or if it is just a shorter delay than you\nlike.\n\n    I understand that servers will close idle connections after some\n    time, but in this case a FIN packet arrives typically within 0.5\n    seconds of the last successful request, which may be before or\n    after the client has sent the next request.  The client is not\n    pipelining requests - it waits for a response to each request\n    before submitting the next - but does not expect the behaviour\n    described above.  The servers in question are not stressed.\n\nThe client is *required* to expect that behavior -- see the MUST-level\nrequirement quoted above.\n\n    If this behaviour is normal, can you confirm the natural corollary\n    to this - that any HTTP/1.1 client must cope with a 'null' response\n    to any 2nd or subsequent HTTP/1.1 request by creating a new socket\n    and re-submitting the request - even where no 'connection: close'\n    response header was included with the previous response?\n\nSection 8.1.4 goes on to say:\n\nClient software SHOULD reopen the\n   transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests\n   without user interaction so long as the request sequence is\n   idempotent (see section 9.1.2). Non-idempotent methods or sequences\n   MUST NOT be automatically retried, although user agents MAY offer a\n   human operator the choice of retrying the request(s). Confirmation by\n   user-agent software with semantic understanding of the application\n   MAY substitute for user confirmation. The automatic retry SHOULD NOT\n   be repeated if the second sequence of requests fails.\n\n-Jeff\n\nP.S.: My personal belief is that a well-implemented server with\nsufficient resources will try to keep a persistent connection\nopen for as long as possible.

The specification, however, does\n> not require this, and in many server architectures it seems to\n> be difficult to maintain large numbers of idle connections without\n> excessive resource consumption.\n\nThe right amount of time seems to be dependent on a number of factors,\nincluding the nature of the server (origin/proxy/gateway), the type of\napplications being used via the server, and the mix of content.  A good\nstudy of HTTP timeouts on a general-purpose server can be found at\n\n    http://www.inria.fr/rrrt/rr-3840.html\n\nThose numbers are based on a traditional daemon listening to a socket\ninterface.  An HTTP server that is tightly integrated with the TCP\nimplementation can do better by managing available ports as potential\nconnections, resulting in significantly less overhead than a user process\nwatching for more requests on a standard TCP socket.  The socket interface\njust isn't smart enough to efficiently handle adaptive timeouts on\nhigh-scalability servers.  The OS needs to manage both TCP wait states\nand the \"between\" states of connection-accept-til-first-data-segment and\nconnection-close-til-client-acks-last-data, since otherwise the amount\nof time spent in those states prevents adaptive timeouts from making new\nconnections available fast enough.\n\nIn other words, a client cannot anticipate the nature of a server's\ntimeout, because HTTP allows it to be tuned according to the needs of\nthe server implementation.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0501783"}, {"subject": "Apacha 1.3 and up Virtual host questio", "content": "I used to do my own dns but then i set a router up and never have been able to get it to work again so i resorted to dns2go.

While IE6 has been around for a while, MS is only\njust now (night before XP launch, of course) deploying upgraded passport\nservers that use it.  \n\nIt looks to be somewhat of a perversion of the spec (sure, no matter how they\ndo it, it isn't \"per spec\" since the spec doesn't cover such a thing, but\nsome ways completely violate the whole concept of HTTP more than others),\nbut that isn't new.\n\nThe server sends something like:\n\nWWW-Authenticate: Passport1.4 lc=1033,id=3,ru=http://registernet.passport.com/mobilepin.srf%3Fru%3Dhttp://memberservices.passport.com/memberservice.srf%253Flc%253D1033%26lc%3D1033%26cbid%3D486%26id%3D3%26cb%3D%26lc%3D1033,tw=20,kv=2,ct=1003992089,cb=,cbid=486,ems=1,ver=2.1.0068.1,tpf=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX,cbid=486\n\nto request authentication...only it doesn't send it with a 401,\nbut with a 302, presumably so non-IE6 browsers will ignore it and\nget the \"normal\" login swizzling process.\n\nThen the browser magically figures out to authenticate (built into XP, of \ncourse) and sends a \"normal\" authorization header:\n\nAuthorization: Passport1.4 from-PP='t=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\n\n(identifiers X'ed out)\n\nThe odd thing I have seen, is that if I authenticate in one browser\nwindow, then open a second window, I am not always authenticated in the\nsecond browser window.  That smells of some really ugly violation of\nthe concept of how HTTP is \"supposed to work\".\n\nI'd be quite interested if anyone has any pointers to docs on the\nprotocol, nothing obvious on MS's site aside from a few references\nto it.  I certainly agree that nothing out there really satisfies \nthe most important needs for authentication on the web, but am far from\nconvinced that this MS attempt adds any value at all.\n\nAnyway, just FYI.

Two requests are unrelated, they\ndon't share any kind of common information. With FTP you have a\nsession/state: authentication, path. This can be useful in several\nsituations. With the cookies a method was designed to create session/state\nover a sessionless/stateless protocol. Other methods used are to pass\ninformation witht the URL, as is still in use, especially at chatboxes or\nwebmail systems. Cookies really enhanced this. This way you can store\ninformation more dynamically and it can be saved over multiple ..., well\n'browsing sessions' :-)\n\n\nA nice chapter would be \"Cookies and Privacy\". On this subject there is\nnumberous information\nI'll give you two statements, were I believe in the last one.\n\nCookies violate privacy, because web masters (or companies) can save\ninformation about your specific browsing patterns and can gather your\npersonal information, directly from your own computer. This is why he always\ndisabled cookies on his system.\nThis can be argumented by someone (it was once on a dutch radio-broadcaster)\nwho, in my opinion, didn't know much about HTTP or cookies.\n\nCookies violate privacy in a way that they can only save information about\nyour browsing patterns, but this can also be done, somewhat more\nanonymously, using your IP address, DNS name/domain, browser type,\nauthentication and such. Next cookies are generated ONLY by the server side,\nso only information that is reveiled to him is accessable to him and can be\nstored in a cookie. Also cookies can only be read by those for who it's\nintended.\nAlso, sessions can be created using cookies and e.g. using the URL.\nInformation this is discoved and stored in a cookie, can be discovered\notherwise and stored on the server.\nNext this kind of information, especially regarding advertisements, is\nalready stored on servers.\n\n\nIf you have some more questions, please ask...\n\n\n- Joris Dobbelsteen\n\n\n\n>-----Original Message-----\n>From: jario [mailto:jario@ieg.com.br]\n>Sent: Sunday, 25 November 2001 20:22\n>To: http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com\n>Subject: cookies history\n>\n>\n>Hi, all.\n>\n>I am developing a thesis regarding the protocol HTTP and I seek for the\n>history of the origin of the cookies.\n>How did they appear?\n>Which reason of the netscape of you create them?\n   Don't understand this question to good.\n>\n>Do you can help me?\n>\n>Thanks\n>\n>Jario\n>\n>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0669471"}, {"subject": "An Question about SHTT", "content": "hey ,\n\nthnx very much for the information. do you have something about a\nflow-chart of http (or shttp)\nI need to know what is happening from the moment I press enter after I\nentered an URL in the AdresBar\nnot like \"it goes to the server and then to the DNS\" but more like the\nrealation with TCP/IP,SSL and certificates.\nI'am on a Reseach and I need this information. can you help me with it?\n\nThank you\n\nGreetings\n\naitmess@hotmail.com\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0680595"}, {"subject": "RE: cookies histor", "content": "1.

Using RFCs or a registry provides some advantages and\ndisadvantages.\n\nThe use of RFCs means that headers are generated with a useful description\nhow they operate. It takes a lot of time for new headers to be documented,\nbut I think this might be worth the effort, but only in some cases.\n\nOn the other hand, creating a registry makes it possible to get a long list\nof mostly useless headers, you don't know where to use them for. If you want\nto set up a registry, ensure that you make some good RULES for adding\nheaders to the list. Make sure the list doesn't get poluted: all the useless\nnames.\n\nA domain name registries (e.g. the .nl domain) runs out of name-space,\nresulting in strange, stupid and funnie names. Even sentences without spaces\nare registered.\n\nMost companies just use there own headers for there products and I don't\nthink they conflict with others. A registry ensures this doesn't happen.\nSome examples could be:\n\n- header names are reviewed. They must be supplied with a name and\n(generalized) description (of working). If agreed to the header, it's put on\nthe list.\n- naming rules: add e.g. company or product name in the header\n\nGeneral purpose headers must be published in RFCs, so others can use them.\nThese don't follow the restrictions for the registry. I suppose you could\ncombine both, in order to benefit from the little time needed to register a\nheader on the registry and RFCs for general purpose headers, usable for\nmultiple applications.

When using\nRFCs, this is already ensured, but the two major complaints are that RFCs\ntake a long time to be published and we don't want a list of RFCs that just\nhandle HTTP extensions that are not meaningful to many applications (will\nnot be implemented in most products). Most companies don't take the time\nneeded to publish the RFC claiming there headers and giving a specification\nof it.\n\nSo why a registry?\n- Fast registration of headers\n- No more (less?) conflicting headers (people register them)\n\nBut why RFCs?\n- They will conform to the HTTP standard\n- Others will know how it interacts with HTTP\n\n\nI would like to (and will) end with note that using a registry doesn't mean\nwe should not require a description of the header any more, it can also mean\nthat we use the same procedure as RFCs, but that the 'registration time' is\ndramatically shortened. This ensure 'good headers' to be registered.\n\nOf course, already described headers cannot be overridden and must be kept.\nOthers should be prevented from registering headers with these names.\n\n- Joris\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0789158"}, {"subject": "Re: SOAP IANA consideration", "content": "OK, so we all want to promote interoperability, right?

But I am\n    seeing a lot of disagreement in this thread about what rules for\n    a HTTP header name registry would promote interoperability most.\n\nThat's a good point.  Promoting interoperability is certainly the\nprimary objective.  But I sense that a secondary objective (at least,\namong some people) is a desire to provide differentiation between\n\"standard\" and \"non-standard\" headers, since (as we saw in the\nproliferation of HTML tags) the creation of new IDs is not without\npotential negative consequences.  (Mostly lack of interoperability,\nbut sometimes more subtle than that.)\n\n    As far as I am concerned it is crazy to try to use an IETF\n    registry to force some minimal level of documentation\n    requirements on all HTTP headers.  Implementing a new header is\n    as simple as adding a line in a CGI script, and many people who\n    have the need and ability to implement new headers will simply\n    not care about getting formal IETF approval of their\n    documentation, if they intend to publish documentation at all.\n\nThe value of having a registry that does require minimal\ndocumentation is that (1) it encourages documentation, for people who\naren't entirely irresponsible, and (2) it allows us to define what\n\"interoperability\" means with respect to a given header name.\n\nImplementors who choose to add header names without going through\nthis process are thus (implicitly, at least) accepting the risk of\nnon-interoperability.  That is, they have only themselves to blame\nif, later on, their software runs into interoperability bugs.\n\nThe catch here is that, if an implementor widely deploys a system\nusing a non-registered header, then this creates future problems for\nstandards-track extensions which inadvertently choose the same\nheader.  So, when Koen writes:\n\n    It would be useful if somebody ran a service which helps\n    everybody in picking new header names that nobody else is using\n    yet.\n\nI agree with him.\n\nThis suggests that the most effective approach (for maintaining\ninteroperability) is the creation of TWO lists.\n\n    1. An IANA registry of \"Standardized HTTP Headers\" that only\n    includes headers described in standards-track documents, or the\n    equivalent.  (I would include \"Best Current Practices\" documents,\n    since protocols such as HTTP/1.0 never entered the IETF Standards\n    Track.)\n\n    2. An IANA registry of \"Known non-standardized HTTP Headers.\" The\n    purpose of this list would simply be to publicize the use (or\n    intended use) of header names, so as to avoid collisions.  As\n    Koen wrote (my paraphrase), \"to maximally promote\n    interoperability [this index should] have very low requirements\n    for registration.  In principle the *only* requirement for\n    registering a header should be the honest intention to start\n    using this header in internet HTTP-type traffic.\"  RFC2434\n    explicitly allows this kind of FCFS registry.\n\nI hope this two-pronged approach satisfies everyone, since we end up\nwith as much documentation as possible, without either unduly\nburdening people trying experiments or application-specific\nextensions, and without implying any approval of non-standards-track\nextensions.\n\n-Jeff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0821853"}, {"subject": "handling ProxyConnectio", "content": "G'day,\n    I'm looking for valid values for Proxy-Connection.

If Proxy-Connection is received by a proxy\nthat doesn't understand it but forwards it to another proxy which does try\nto implement it, the connection will hang on the response.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0942806"}, {"subject": "Contenttype, MIME and multipar", "content": "G'day people,\n    I'm working on the bit of code to figure out multipart messages.\nAfter reading over a few of the RFC's, I was wondering if there are any\ngood urls people know of which provide intepretations of the standard.\nI'm working on this part by myself, so I'd like to see someone elses\ninterpretation for verification purposes.  \n \nThanks in advance...\nMatt Lynch\nDeveloper\nStimulus Solutions \n\n  _____  \n\nEmail: Matt@StimulusSolutions.com.au\nPhone: 8259 0368\nMobile: 0425 274158\nICQ: 1314140\nWeb: http://www.stimulussolutions.com.au\n\n  _____  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-0950585"}, {"subject": "FW: I-D ACTION:draft-nottingham-http-header-reg00.tx", "content": "----- Forwarded message from Internet-Drafts@ietf.org -----\n\nDate: Wed, 09 Jan 2002 16:02:35 -0500\nFrom: Internet-Drafts@ietf.org\nReply-To: Internet-Drafts@ietf.org\nTo: IETF-Announce: ;\nSubject: I-D ACTION:draft-nottingham-http-header-reg-00.txt\n\nA New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.\n\n\nTitle: HTTP Header Field-Name Registries\nAuthor(s): M.

Get your piece of this \naction!!! \n\n\nMULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is being \ntaught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the \nWall Street Journal have stated that between 50\\% and 65\\% of all goods and \nservices will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's. \n\n\nThis is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 3,500,000 millionaires \nin the WORLD, 20\\% ( 700,000) made their fortune in the last several years \nin MLM. Moreover, statistics show that over 100 people become millionaires \neveryday through Multi-Level Marketing. \n\nYou may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump (A \nMULTI-BILLIONAIRE, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD) made an \nappearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if \nhe lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, \nTrump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. \nThe audience started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and \ndead-panned his response \"That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all \nsitting out there!\" \n\nWith network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions \nfrom sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you \nintroduce to the business. \n\nResidual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time or \nmoney once and getting paid again and again and again. In network \nmarketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others. \n\nThis program is currently being utilized in more than 50 different \ncountries across the world. \n\nThe enclosed INF0RMATION is something I almost let slip through my fingers. \nFortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and \nstudy to it. \n\nMy name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for \nthe past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated. After \nunproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the \npast year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, \nfriends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my \nbusiness and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and \nborrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT \nTHAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to \nshare the experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER \nFINANCIALLY!!! \n\nIn mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to \nreceiving this program I had been sending away for INF0RMATION on various \nbusiness opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were \nnot cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or \nthe initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would \nwork or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one \nyear...it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! \n\nBut like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I \ndidn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing \nlist. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make \nsure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a \nMONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start, \nwithout putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and \nfigured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I \nwas still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects \nof it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 \n24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the \nprogram was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\" \n\nInitially I sent out 100,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time \non-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for \nprinting to send out the program, and because all of my orders are \nfulfilled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it \nis, I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not \n\"rip-off\" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. \n\nIn less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. By \nJanuary 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to \n\"RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T, \nSEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!\" My first step in making $46,000 in 90 \ndays was done. \n\n\nBy January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. Your goal is to \n\"RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND \nOUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, \nRELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $46,000 GOAL.\" Well, I had 196 orders for \nREPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. \n\n\nBy March 1, of my e-mailing of 100,000, I received $42,000 with more coming \nin every day. \n\nI paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time \nto read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!! Remember, \nit won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must \nfollow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in \na different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In \norder for this program to work, you must meet your goal of 20+ orders for \nREPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $46,000 or more \nin 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! \n\nIf you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is \na great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to \nparticipate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial \nsecurity. \n\nIf you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like I was, \nor you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! \n\nSincerely, \n\nJohnathon Rourke \n\n\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It \nworks exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this \nexciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send \nthis to may send out 100,000 or more...and your name will be on everyone of \nthem! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers \nyou will reach. \n\nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, INF0RMATION, materials and \nopportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! \n\n\"THINK ABOUT IT\" \n\n\nBefore you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a \nlittle time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure \nout what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible \nresponse and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make lot of \nmoney! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have \nwill vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! \nJody Jacobs, Richmond, VA \n\nHERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ \n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n\nThis method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that \nyou could use up to $46,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say \n\"BULL... \", please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, \nbut a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you \ndo: \n\nAs with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new \npartners and selling our products. Because of the global nature of the \ninternet, you will be able to recruit new multi-level business partners \nfrom all over the world, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR \nORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in \npersonal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store or office. \nThis is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere. \n\nThis is what you MUST do: \n\n1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below \n(you can't sell them if you don't order them). \n\na. For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU \nARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case \nof a problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the \nreport. \nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL \nPROBLEMS! \n\nb. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. \nYou will need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer \nand resell them. \n\nc. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five \nreports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to \nsend to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. \n\n2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to \neach report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is \ninstructed below in steps \"a\" through \"g\" or you will lose out on the \nmajority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you'll \nalso see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has \nbeen tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. \n\na. Look below for the listing of available reports. \n\nb. After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement and \nREM0VE the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it \nthrough the cycle and is no doubt counting their $46,000! Also, change the \nname of the company, the address, and the REM0VE e-mail address on the top \nof this document to your own. \n\nc. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. \n\nd. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. \n\ne. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. \n\nf. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. \n\ng. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. \n\nPlease make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! \n\n3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save \nit to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this \nletter. \n\nYour cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can \nafford $25). You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail \nis FREE! \n\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports \nyou purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing INF0RMATION which \nincludes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free \nclassified ads and much, much more. \n\nIn addition you will be provided with INF0MATION on Internet Marketing \nClubs such as INTERNET MARKETING RESOURCES(IMR): This is one the premiere \ninternet marketing clubs on the INTERNET. This club provides a forum where \ninternet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets \non Internet Marketing. In addition, members of this club are provided free \ninternet marketing tools and services for the Do-Yourself-Internet-Marketer. \n\nThey will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1,000,000 \nfresh e-mail addresses each week. This club will provide you with hundreds \nof free resources which include: How to obtain free web sites, how to \nobtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site, how to send bulk \ne-mail into AOL and Compuserve, how to market your products on newsgroups, \nfree classified ads, electronic malls, bulletin boards, banner ads and much \nmore. \n\nThere are two primary methods of building your downline: \n\nMETHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL \n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and \nwe'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. \nLet's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.3\\% response. Using a good \nlist the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out \nhundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with \nthis example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.3\\% response, that \nis only 6 orders for REPORT #1. Those 6 people respond by sending out 2,000 \nprograms each for a total of 12,000. Out of those 0.3\\%, 36 people respond \nand order REPORT #2. Those 36 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of \n72,000. The 0.3\\% response to that is 216 orders for REPORT #3. Those 216 \nsend out 2,000 programs each for a 432,000 total. The 0.3\\% response to that \nis 1,296 orders for REPORT #4. Those 1,296 send out 2,000 programs each for \na 2,592,000 total. The 0.3\\% response to that is 7,776 orders for REPORT #5. \n\n\nThat's 7,776 $5 bills for you, CASH!!! Your total income in this example is \n$30 + $180 + $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 for a total of $46,650!!! \n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,994 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO \nWILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A \nMOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS \nINSTEAD OF 2,000. \nBelieve me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost \nto participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have \nan internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! \n\nREPORT #2 and #5 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing, tell you \nwhere to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists \nand show you how to send out 1,000,000 e-mails for free. \n\nMETHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n\n1. Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are \nHUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small \njust to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 6 people to \nparticipate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet \nwill EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR \nORGANIZATION gets ONLY 6 downline members. Follow this example to achieve \nthe STAGGERING results below. \n\n1st level--your 6 members with $5 ($5 x 6)........................$30 \n2nd level--6 members from those 6 ($5 x 36)....................$180 \n3rd level--6 members from those 36 ($5 x 216)............ $1,080 \n4th level--6 members from those 216 ($5 x 1,296)....... $6,480 \n5th level-6 members from those 1,296 ($5 x 7,776)... $38,880 \n...............................................$46,650 \n_________________________________________________________________________ \n\n\nRemember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit \n6 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people \nto participate!

Especially the rule \nof not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and \nyou'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It \nreally is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little \ncost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, \nand you'll be on your way to financial security. \nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand \n\nMy name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost \naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When \nI received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \"junk mail.\" I \nmade fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and \npercentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my \nsupposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of \nher, and was ready to lay the old \"I told you so\" on her when the thing \ndidn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received \nover 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 \nbills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it \nwouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby.\" I \ndid have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the \"rat race\" \nand it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. \nMitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL \n\nThe main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is \nhonest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of \nmoney in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this \nout. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal \neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the \nfirst 14 weeks, with money still coming in. \nSincerely yours, \nPam Hedland Halmstad, Sweden \n\nNot being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to \nparticipate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the \ninitial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't \nget enough orders to at least get my money back. I surprised when I found \nmy medium-size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so \noverloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make \nmore money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing \nabout this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply \nisn't a better investment with a faster return. \nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n\nI had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I \nshouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to \nget another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program, \n11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more \nthan $41,000 on the first try!! \nMohamed, Cairo, Egypt \n\nThis is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, \nand will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our \nmoney. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do \nit. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden \nopportunity. \nGood luck and happy spending! \nSam Lee Suva, Fiji Islands \n\n\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO FINANCIAL \nFREEDOM! \n\nNOW IS THE TIME FOR YOUR TURN \n\nDECISIVE ACTION YIELDS POWERFUL RESULTS \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you need help with starting a business, registering a \nbusiness name, learning how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local \noffice of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) \n1-(800)827-5722 for free help and answers to questions.

This is the letter \nyou\nhave been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of\nthis letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below,\nto see if it really can make people money.

To assist\nyou with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you\npurchase will provide you with very invaluable marketing information which\nincludes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free\nclassified ads and much more.\n\n= = = = =There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: = = = = =\n\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we\nwill assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%\nresponse, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\nby sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those\n50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded \nand\nordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500, 000\ne-mails.The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000\n(50 million) e-mails.\n\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report\n# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3....\n$5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\n\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE \nRESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL SURELY EARN BACK YOUR \nMINOR INVESTMENT (US$25), STILL GETTING INVALUABLE MARKETING INFORMATION AND \nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY !\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.\n\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even\none 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are \npresently\nover 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, \nmany\npeople will do just that, and more!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n\nAdvertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method\n# 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you \nmust\ndo is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same\nday service on all orders.\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and\naddress on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they\nreceive the report.\n\n=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\n====================================================\nNotes:\n1) Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY only) for each Report.\nBecause of the global coverage of the program, Checks, other currencies\nor Money Orders can NOT be accepted. (US$ notes you can obtain from your\nnearest bank/major hotel/money exchanger)\n2) Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets\nof paper.\n3) On one of those sheets of paper, Write:\n   1.

This is possible because every\nuser has a different cache. But MS provides an option to disable caching of\nencrypted content.\n\nI guess browsers will threat encrypted content the same way as unencrypted\ncontent: doesn't matter to them. I suppose you should set up a web site the\nsame way, whether it's send using HTTP or HTTPS.\n\nEnabling compression is also a good way to save bandwidth. There may be some\ncomplications with bad developed proxies when using HTTP (unsecured).\nIf you enable Encryption on MS/IIS you should ensure that the content\ndoesn't expire directly because of compression (see IIS help for more about\nthis).\n\nEnsure you use encryption as less as possible, as it requires much\nprocessing overhead and content will only be cached by user agents. Ensure\nmost content is cached by everbody (cache-control: public).\nContent that will change regarly must have expire times and preferably\ncached by everybody.\nEnsure to support reporting \"Not Changed\" status, which could also save a\nlot of bandwidth.\nContent that is specific to users and/or contains sensative information\nshould be cached by the user-agent only, and optionally require revalidation\n(getting new content or \"Not changed\" status).\n\nIndeed, you can sacrafise bandwidth for user-friendlyness: entire page over\nsecure channel or unsecured channel. I would really recommend this.\n\nNote that home-pages should not be encrypted: this is where most users will\ncome and hopefully directly leave. Also home-pages don't include sensative\ninformation (usually).\nDo authentication over HTTPS, even as sending sensative content. You should\nnot cache too much about messages about switching between secure and\nunsecure channels. This happens at many sites.\n\nYou can, like most webmail applications, mix unsecured and secured, in an\neffort to save bandwidth and reduce processor utilization.\n\nHope these suggestions will help you a little bit...\n\n- Joris\n\n>-----Original Message-----\n>From: M?r ?rlygsson [mailto:mar@anomy.net]\n>Sent: Monday, 11 February 2002 12:05\n>To: http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com\n>Subject: HTTPS and cache on the client-side\n>\n>\n>Hi.

I  attended a business\nseminar held at Kumasi, Ghana in May  2001. At this \nseminar, I was introduced to one Dr. Wisdom Mensah,\nthe president of  MAR DOWELS ETS. Dr. Mensah is an\naccomplished and widely known farmer  in this part of\nthe region, He is a respected personality, who\nspecializes  in cattle and goat farms, including\nvarious agricultural products for  export. He has\nfarms in different countries of West Africa. But above\n all he is one of the greatest suppliers of cattle,\nand dairy products in this side coast. \n    \n Realizing my profession, Dr. Mensah, took me into\nconfidence to inform  me of the enormous amount of\nmoney he spends in purchasing of a particular,  but\nvery important medicine for his livestock. He\nintimated me that he buys quantities of 200-250\ncartons of this product at a time for $5000.00  per\ncarton. He was curious to know if my organization\ncould source a  cheaper supplier of the same product\nfor him given the trends of fall  in the price of beef\nin most markets.\n   \n  Anxiously at the office, I discussed this with my\ncompany's director,  who decided it would be best if\nwe handle the supply ourselves. We carried  out\nresearch and discovered that we could obtain the same\nproduct at an exact cheaper price of production in  \nOVERSEA    at $2,000.00 per carton. We immediately\nmade a proposal to MAR DOWELS to make supply to him at\n$4,800 per carton for which he accepted. For my\ninvolvement in the entire arrangement, my director\noffered to give me a 30% of whatever profit realized\non each supply I readily accepted. \n    \n On the 12th June  2001, the first supply of 120\ncartons were made to MAR DOWELS. My director at this\njuncture practically forgot our understanding. When I\nquestioned, I was given a mere token of appreciation.\nAny further\n protest from me was threatened with a dismissal from\noffice. I quickly tried to repair the damage and\nmaintain my civility but his relationship with me has\nceased to be cordial. I was under the impression that\nbusiness\n between him and Dr. Mensah has also ended in a bitter\nnote as he led me to believe.\n\n Only recently, I intercepted some mails from MAR\nDOWELS to my director. I was shocked to find out that\ntwo additional supplies have been made to them and\nwhich I was not informed. This time Dr. Mensah is\nrequesting\n for a supply of 500 cartons of the same product\nbecause of a suspected  out break among his livestock\nin Niger Republic. He has requested that  these\nsupplies be made before the 21/01/ 2002. He is also\nrequesting\n for another supply meant for storing of 1,500 cartons\nagainst the unpredictable  new millennium. However the\n500 cartons are more urgently needed at the moment.\nThese letters will never reach my director's desk. \nInstead I contacted Dr. Mensah and convinced him that\nI can arrange for an International supplier who can\nsupply the same product at $4, 200 per carton. At This\nparticular moment, Dr. Mensah, is awaiting further\ndirective from my foreign contact and me as he has\nsuspended all dealings with my director. I can not\nhandle this transaction alone because I am still\nworking fo my boss.  If you can handle this project,\nplease contact me on my e-mail: Michaeldams@yahoo.com \nfor more details on how to go about it. I contacted\nyou because I need a foreign partner who can honestly\ngo into business with me. You just claim to be the\nsupplier and I will introduce you to the company from\nwhere the supplies will be made. All I care for is the\n30% profit after the transaction. This business could\nlast long if well  negotiated. I expect your urgent\nreply, thank you.  \n\nBest Regards \nMichael Adams\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nFind the one for you at Yahoo!

He was curious to know if my organization\ncould source a  cheaper supplier of the same product\nfor him given the trends of fall  in the price of beef\nin most markets.\n   \n  Anxiously at the office, I discussed this with my\ncompany's director,  who decided it would be best if\nwe handle the supply ourselves. We carried  out\nresearch and discovered that we could obtain the same\nproduct at an exact cheaper price of production in  \nOVERSEA    at $2,000.00 per carton. We immediately\nmade a proposal to MAR DOWELS to make supply to him at\n$4,800 per carton for which he accepted. For my\ninvolvement in the entire arrangement, my director\noffered to give me a 30% of whatever profit realized\non each supply I readily accepted. \n    \n On the 12th June  2001, the first supply of 120\ncartons were made to MAR DOWELS. My director at this\njuncture practically forgot our understanding. When I\nquestioned, I was given a mere token of appreciation.\nAny further\n protest from me was threatened with a dismissal from\noffice. I quickly tried to repair the damage and\nmaintain my civility but his relationship with me has\nceased to be cordial. I was under the impression that\nbusiness\n between him and Dr. Mensah has also ended in a bitter\nnote as he led me to believe.\n\n Only recently, I intercepted some mails from MAR\nDOWELS to my director. I was shocked to find out that\ntwo additional supplies have been made to them and\nwhich I was not informed. This time Dr. Mensah is\nrequesting\n for a supply of 500 cartons of the same product\nbecause of a suspected  out break among his livestock\nin Niger Republic. He has requested that  these\nsupplies be made before the 21/01/ 2002. He is also\nrequesting\n for another supply meant for storing of 1,500 cartons\nagainst the unpredictable  new millennium. However the\n500 cartons are more urgently needed at the moment.\nThese letters will never reach my director's desk. \nInstead I contacted Dr. Mensah and convinced him that\nI can arrange for an International supplier who can\nsupply the same product at $4, 200 per carton. At This\nparticular moment, Dr. Mensah, is awaiting further\ndirective from my foreign contact and me as he has\nsuspended all dealings with my director. I can not\nhandle this transaction alone because I am still\nworking fo my boss.  If you can handle this project,\nplease contact me on my e-mail: Michaeldams@yahoo.com \nfor more details on how to go about it. I contacted\nyou because I need a foreign partner who can honestly\ngo into business with me. You just claim to be the\nsupplier and I will introduce you to the company from\nwhere the supplies will be made. All I care for is the\n30% profit after the transaction.

It seems to me that if a client,\nfor example, regularly places an order and receives and acknowledgement\nthere is a possible replay attack.  \n\nIf an intermediary attacker intercepts the order he can impersonate\nthe server and offer a nonce from a previous transaction.  The client\nthen submits the order which is grabbed by the attacker and then the\nattacker replays a previous acknowledgement with the dates changed.  A\nsimilar attack might involve sending a fake 304 when in fact the\nresource has changed.  This is what hash dates is supposed to prevent.\nAm I missing something.\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1169076"}, {"subject": "WSCH : A Revolutionary Acne Treatment and More                   ", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-11774941"}, {"subject": "Te interesa la econom?a ", "content": " <http://www.cityeconomika.com/> \n\n  \n     27 de Febrero de 2002 \n  \n\nLo invitamos a conocer CityEconomika.com <http://www.cityeconomika.com>\n, el primer portal dedicado exclusivamente a la econom?a de C?rdoba y el\ninterior del pa?s.

It occurs (optionally)\nas a field in the Authorization request header and in the optional\nAuthentication-info response header.   Nowhere else.

Preventing the stripping of both digest and dheaders is done by\nthe digest-required parameter in the request Authorization header.\nHere is a quote from the specification:\n\n       \"If the value of the digest-required parameter is \"true\", the\n       response to this request MUST either include the \"digest\" field\n       in its Authentication-Info header or the response should be an\n       error message indicating the server is unable or unwilling to\n       supply this field. In the latter case the requested entity MUST\n       not be returned as part of the response.\"\n\nIf we decide on dheaders then this would change to \"MUST either\ninclude the \"digest\" field and the \"dheaders\" field or...\"\n\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1207359"}, {"subject": "?????????? ?????? ???? ??2?? ???????????????? ???? ?????? ???? ????????????????.[??.??", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-12076929"}, {"subject": "Propuesta de Consultor?", "content": "Buenos Aires, enero de 2002.- \n\nAtenci?n Sr. Gerente General \n\nMolestamos su atenci?n a efectos de adjuntarle nuestra propuesta de servicios \nde consultor?a en planeamiento estrat?gico, la cual en momentos como los actuales, \ncreemos que ser? de su inter?s. \n\nEstamos informandole que proximamente le enviarios nuestro bolet?n \"Reflexiones\", \nen el cual abordamos cuestiones de inter?s estrat?gico y econ?mico, para la alta \ngerencia empresaria. \n\nLe saludo atentamente \n\nDr. Obdulio Dur?n \n\nPara contactarse con nosotros por favor NO RESPONDA A ESTE MENSAJE, utilice la \ndirecci?n dap_consulting@yahoo.com o ll?menos al 15-4414-2008\n\n\nPor secci?n 301, p?rrafo (a)(2)(C) de S.1618.

Livello - Diagnostica/Recupero \n       \n        Questo livello ? applicabile solo ad unit? Floppy Disk, Hard Disk, Cartucce Removibili e Sistemi RAID, e consiste nel tentativo di recuperare i dati SENZA L'USO DELLA CAMERA BIANCA con conseguente contenimento dei costi, e utilizzando il ns. sistema di lettura a basso livello. Questo livello, nella maggior parte dei casi, permette di recuperare i dati da unit? che :\n      - Hanno problemi nella struttura logica del files dovuti a cancellazioni, formattazioni, partizionamenti, crash di sistema, operazioni errate o causati da Virus informatici.\n      - Hanno difetti nell'elettronica di gestione.\n      Dopo aver eseguito la diagnostica, ove possibile, verr? generate una File List contenente l'elenco di tutti i files recuperabili* o ricostruibili**. Tale lista verr? inviate mezzo Email al cliente e seguir? mezzo Fax/Email il preventivo per la lavorazione.\n      L'eventuale recupero ? inteso per tutti i files indicati in file list. Di norma non ? possibile selezionare solo i files che si desiderano recuperare.\n      I dati recuperati verranno salvati su supporti CD-R. \n        \n      2? Livello - Diagnostica in Camera Bianca    \n        Questo livello ? sostitutivo del 1? in quanto l'intervento comporta L'APERTURA DELL'UNITA' IN CAMERA BIANCA per sostituire parti meccaniche/elettroniche interne difettose, isolare i danni presenti sui dischi, ricostruire la struttura delle partizioni, delle cartelle e dei files. Al termine di queste operazioni, se la superficie del disco non ? irrimediabilmente compromessa, verr? generata una File List contenente l'elenco dei files recuperabili* o ricostruibili**. Tale lista verr? inviata mezzo Email al cliente e seguir? mezzo Fax/Email il preventivo per il 3? Livello, cio? il recupero dei dati. \n        \n      3? Livello - Recupero dati da Camera Bianca   \n        Questo livello ? successivo al 2?. L'eventuale recupero ? inteso per tutti i files indicati in file list. Non ? assolutamente possibile selezionare solo alcuni files. Verranno salvati sia i dati recuperati*, che i dati ricostruiti**.\n      I dati recuperati verranno salvati su supporti CD-R. \n\n\n* i files recuperati sono quelli completi \n** i files ricostruiti sono quelli recuperati parzialmente, e non vi ? alcuna garanzia anche se ? probabile che parte del contenuto sia intatto.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIl modulo non ? assolutamente impegnativo, e la prevalutazione tecnica ?

Please let me know\nif you think I did any violence to them or the intent.\n\nLarry\nHTTP Working Group Meeting, December 8, 10, 1997\nChair: Larry Masinter\n\nMinutes were recorded by Jim Whitehead, Daniel Veillard and Rohit Khare,\nedited by Larry Masinter. These minutes combine the notes from Monday\nDecember 8 and Wednesday December 10.\n\nWe reviewed issues from the issue list.  Most of these issues reflect\nedits that were already in the 'rev-01' draft but needed additional\nreview.\n\nNew issue AUTH-INFO-SYNTAX: New issue, reviewed for the group, but no\nconculsion.\n\nNew issue DIGEST-PROBS: Reviewed briefly, but take to the list.\n\nHenrik presented CONTENT-ENCODING and a proposed solution: add to\naccept-encoding \"*\" (meaning all encodings), \"identity\" (meaning no\nencoding), and qvalues (for yes and no).  There are some proxy issues\nwith respect to content-encoding, and transfer encoding: a\nContent-Encoding can go through proxies, but a Transfer-Encoding\ncannot. Dropping q values would avoid 406 codes from existings HTTP/1.1\nservers, but would not fix some current problems.  After discussion on\nwhether any clients will support this, and a proposal of a\n\"Decline-Encodings\" header, the preferred solution is to use the\nsolution in the issues list. This will be discussed more on the mailing\nlist.\n\nIssue PUT-RANGE: Few people had reviewed the rev-01 draft. There was no\nimplementation experience with this in the room ( Henrik claims that he\nmight have implemented something similar, once). On Wednesday, we\ndiscussed that the use might be in a proxy which updates a byterange of\nits _cached_ copy at the same time it passes back to the origin. But 1)\nin WebDAV, many proxies may have partial views of the update\nchanges. So, you'd have to recheck e-tags to update caches -- and\nredownload all that material. 2) more to the point, editing ususally\nadds and removes material, which put-range does not do. This feature\nrequires a robust version number to detect the feature; a server that\ndid PUT but not byteranges would REPLACE the whole resource; thus it\nshould be forbidden, not just discouraged.  We agreed to leave PUT with\nbyte-ranges out of HTTP/1.1 (discouraged or forbidden). The WebDAV group\nmay propose a PATCH method to handle this capability instead.\n\nIssue DIGEST_SYNTAX: was reviewed, but will be discussed on the list.\n\nIssue PROTECTION-SPACE: People are happy with the current language, but\ncurrent implementations don't behave as specified; the spec doesn't\nbreak any existing implementation. We'll go forward with the current\nlanguage in rev-01.\n\nIssue CONTRADICTION: The Proxy-Length change introduced an error. The\nproposal in rev-01 was accepted.\n\nIssue IMS_INM_MISMATCH: The proposal in rev-01 was accepted.\n\nIssue BYTERANGE_SYNTAX: This is a subtle problem; some implementors seem\nto want to be too smart. We need to specify that you should do the\n\"dumb\" thing, not the \"smart\" thing.  The proposal in rev-01 was\naccepted.\n\nIssue PROXY-REDIRECT: The functionality is desirable (e.g., for\nswitching to a new protocol in the future, via use of proxies), but\nsomeone from needs to develop a draft to address this\nproblem. Resolution: add note to spec. to deprecate 305, and note that\nit should not be implemented.  Document security problem with this\nstatus code.\n\nIssue RE-AUTHENTICATION-REQUESTED: Most current clients do not discard\ncredentials when they receive a 4xx status code.  Roy Fielding had\nsuggested that an extra header should be used to inform the client to\ndiscard credentials.  One problem with this approach is the server does\nnot know if the client really has discarded credentials. Resolution: add\na note to the security considerations indicating that this issue exists,\nbut has not been addressed in the specification.  This should not be in\nthe Draft Standard 1.1 spec. Scott Lawrence may develop an\nInternet-Draft to address this issue outside of the Draft Standard.\n\nIssue RANGE_WITH_CONTENTCODING: Should range requests apply before or\nafter content coding?  On Wednesday, we agreed to \"last call\" the\nresolution in rev-01.\n\nIssue TRAILER_FIELDS: Discussion on why this is needed, and whether\nclients are likely to support this. On Wednesday, we agreed to \"last call\"\nthe resolution in rev-01.\n\nIssue HOST: Resolution in rev-01 is closed.\n\nIssue RE-VERSION: (Wednesday) If you DON'T upgrade the request, you'll\nget a lower-version answer for your cache -- a subsequent 1.1 request\nCAN'T be satisfied from a 1.0 cached response. 1.0 requests can be\nanswered from 1.1 responses. Richer responses can always be used to\nanswer simpler queries. Henry Sanders will post his remarks to the list,\nand then RE-VERSION will be closed.\n\nNew issue DIGEST-SCALING: (Wednesday)\nRFC 2069 had one concern raised: Digest does not work well with proxies\nand not at all across multiple servers. Paul Leach will soon post to the\nlist a small tweak which addresses both (and issue a new I-D?).\n\n================================================================\nState Management:\n\nDave Kristol reviewed State Management\n\nTimeline: \n- December, 1995 [sic!]\n  state management sub-group formed\n- April, 1996\n  first Internet Draft, http-state-mgmt-00\n- July, 1996\n  I-D submitted as prospective RFC, minor wording tweaks for\n  IESG in Oct., Nov.\n- February, 1997 \n  RFC 2109 issued\n\nRFC 2109 Issues:\n- compatibility (interoperability):\n  client behavior on unrecognized attributes \n- privacy\n  especially \"unverifiable transactions\" user\n- interface requirements\n  arising from support of privacy protection\n\nRFC 2109 Followup, since February:\n- compatibility (interoperability)\n  Define Set-Cookie2 response header\n- privacy and user interface requirements\n  temporarily delete contentious parts\n\nMajor Changes Since RFC 2109:\n- Set-Cookie -> Set-Cookie2\n- add CommentURL attribute\n- add Discard attribute\n- add Port attribute\n- fuss with Domain, domain-matching\n- clarify behavior for unrecognized or duplicate attributes\n\nState Management Progress Plan\n- current draft:  http-state-man-mec-05\n  \"pure protocol\" (more or less)\n- do Last Call on -05\n- restore privacy/user interface parts\n- discuss and seek consensus\n- reach Last Call\n- submit result to supersede RFC 2109\n\nWhere to look:\n- DMK's cookie page\n    http://portal.research.bell-labs.com/~dmk/cookie.html\n- Current draft\n    draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-05.txt\n- HTTP-WG mailing list\n    http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/\n- http-state mailing list\n    http://www.bell-labs.com/mailing-lists/http-state\n\nFollowing the slide presentation, there was discussion on the privacy\nconsiderations in the draft.

On Wednesday,\nit was reported that a small group of developers reviewed the\noutstanding issues with state management and found one technical and one\npolitical problem left. Technically, domain matching does not work with\nflat (intranet) domains where \"foo.\" is an FQDN. The political issue is\nuser notification of cookies from unverifiable transactions -- should\npeople be tracked by an external source of inline images or applets or\naudio?\n================================================================\nExtensions\n\nScott Lawrence gave a presentation on OPTIONS and PEP:\n  Motivation - Extensibility\n    Both OPTIONS and PEP were intended to provide more robust\n    extensibility mechanisms for HTTP/1.1.\n  Extensibility of HTTP/1.1\n   -Clients can advertise some kinds of capabilities using Accept-*\n    headers.\n   -Clients and Servers can prevent inappropriate caching by 1.1 Proxies\n    using Vary and Cache-Control.  This may result in cache misses that\n    could have been hits, but can if used correctly prevent hits that\n    should have been misses.\n   -Clients have _very_ limited ability to discover whether or not a\n    Server implements a given extension.  The response version number\n    and the OPTIONS method are the only mechanisms available.\n   -No mechanisms for discovering which optional or extension headers\n    are supported.\n   -No mechanisms for discovering which optional or extension headers\n    are supported, or what definition of a given header is implemented.\n   -Discovery of Proxy capabilities by either Clients or Origin Servers\n    is worse.\n  History\n   -These issues have been discussed on the WG list since (at least)\n    early 1995, insufficient consensus has been reached to incorporate\n    stronger general purpose discovery mechanisms into the standard.\n  Issues Resolutions for Draft Standard\n   -OPTIONS: Incorporate only the minimal definition (no defined body\n    for OPTIONS response, only use the Allow header field).\n   -PEP: Possibly proceed as an Experimental RFC, nothing in Draft\n    Standard.\n  Futures\n   -Extensions to HTTP are being actively developed, both by and within\n    IETF (UAhint, Safe, Content Negotiation, State Management, WEBDAV,\n    Hit Metering)\n  Guidelines for Extensions\n   -HTTP-WG has learned (and relearned) about many problems inherent in\n    each of the possible means of extending HTTP (new methods, new\n    headers, new values or semantics in existing headers).  Protocol\n    mechanisms have not been defined to avoid or mitigate all of these\n    possible pitfalls.\n    \n   -It would seem to be a good idea to develop an archival document\n    (FYI, BCP?) to capture some of this knowledge as advise to others\n    who will develop and attempt to deploy HTTP extensions.  This will\n    not be a work item of the HTTP working group.\n\nAfter discussion Monday & Wednesday, a new working group (HTTP EXTEND)\nwill be chartered. It is important to move forward on this because there\nare a large number of working groups that want to layer themselves on\ntop of HTTP.\n\nThere is a need to develop a document which explains both the \"dos\" and\nthe \"don'ts\" of extending HTTP.  This document should start with the\n\"don'ts\" so they can be captured to prevent future bad practice.\n\nThe HTTP Extension group will develop PEP, the HTTP extension guidelines\ndocument, and the OPTIONS draft.  The Extensions team reported a\nstrawman charter for 1) producing an FYI document of guidance on adding\nfeatures, headers, and methods to HTTP, 2) extending error response\ncodes, 3) and simplifying PEP and OPTIONS into a reliable extension\nhook. It is NOT an HTTP/1.2 group. Josh Cohen and Scott Lawrence will\nchair and edit, respectively, an investigation into how-to-extend, not\nwhat-to-extend.\n\nOther extensions were discussed, e.g., transactional HTTP. People forget\nabout interaction with proxies in general; it should be explicitly\nconsidered.\n\nThe group will also take on Schulzrinne's extened error codes work. (The\narguments against on http-wg were really bogus.)  A report on experience\nreading PEP: it was necessary to talk to Henrik to figure it out. A\nrequirements document may be necessary and will be considered.\n\nThere is no formal requirement for a separate BOF, but the IESG\nmay need to announce the working group.\n================================================================\nKeith Moore asked for volunteers for a document to integrate TLS &\nHTTP. Rohit Khare volunteered.\n================================================================\nInteroperable implementations:\n\nTo advance to Draft Standard, we need to document at least two\nindependent, interoperable implementations of each feature. It isn't\nnecessary that the features be in the same implementation, and the\nimplementations need not be shipping products.\n\nTuesday night, a half-dozen client, server, and proxy developers sat\ndown with the chair and editor to walk through the draft section by\nsection. The main insight was that we'll need much more systematic\nsupport to document the hundreds of requirements in HTTP/1.1. Caching,\nin particular, seems to be the most fraught with difficulty. Scott\nLawrence agreed to continue his (very useful) Thursday testing bees; and\nthere was a survey of interest in face-to-face implementation bake-offs\nor conference calls.\n================================================================\nWeb Privacy\n\nUser Services sponsored a BOF on Web Privacy. April Marine reported the\nbroad support for investigating the nexus of trust issues around the\nWeb. A detailed charter awaits debate, though, on web-priv@nasa.gov. A\nsecond BOF is projected for LA.\n================================================================\nContent Negotiation\n\nRecipient Feature Profile (nee content-negotiation), weaves together\nextensibility threads from HTTP, printing, fax, mail, and many other\napplication-layer protocols. Ted Hardie reported the conviction the\ngroup will set up a registry as quickly as possible. Then, it may tackle\naggregation of features and a prototypical example of how to store\nprofiles within LDAP, etc.\n================================================================\nHTTP-NG\n\nW3C has been working on experiments for HTTP-NG, which had a BOF at 39th\nIETF and will surely be heard from in 1998.\n================================================================\nCONCLUSION\n\nA poll (\"Will there be an HTTP/1.2?\") had a lot of responses, split\n50-50.\n\nThis was the last planned meeting of the HTTP working group. The group's\nchartered work is nearly complete, and no further meetings will be\nnecessary. Additional work will happen in other groups or outside a\nformal working group. The mailing list will remain open.\n\nWe're not really done: one estimate was that 20 more issues will be\nraised from the interoperability testing.  But regardless, this was the\nLAST meeting. Scott Lawrence commits to continuing Thursday\ninteroperability tests until such time as testing becomes\nuninteresting. The HTTP-WG mailing list will remain open indefinitely\n(or until Standard status 2 years from now).\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1264466"}, {"subject": "???? ???? ???? ?????????? ???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-12649990"}, {"subject": "[?? ??] ???? ???????? ???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-12656481"}, {"subject": "[????] ???????????? ?????????? ????????????", "content": "         ?? ?? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ???? ???? ???? ?? 50???? ??????

I think these changes\ncan be characterized as largely fixes to interoperability\nproblems between authenticating agents and proxies.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n            entity-digest =\n                    <\"> KD (H(H(A1)), unquoted nonce-value \":\"\n                         transaction-info \":\" H(entity-body)) <\">\n                                       ; format is <\"> *LHEX <\">\n\n            transaction-info       =\n              H(\n                Method \":\"\n                digest-uri-value \":\"\n                media-type \":\"   ; Content-Type, see section 3.7 of [2]\n                content-coding \":\" ; Content-Encoding, see 3.5 of [2]\n                dheader-content\n                )\n\n    dheader-content   = *DIGIT \":\" ; HTTP response status code\n                                *DIGIT \":\"         ; entity-length, see ??\n                                date \":\"  ; contents of origin HTTP date header\n                                last-modified \":\" ; last modified date\n                                expires   ; expiration date\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n            AuthenticationInfo = \"Authentication-Info\" \":\"\n                                1#( digest \",\" digested-headers | nextnonce )\n\n            nextnonce          = \"nextnonce\" \"=\" nonce-value\n            digest             = \"digest\" \"=\" entity-digest\n    digested-headers   = \"dheaders\" \"=\" <\"> dheader-content <\">\n\n\n            date              = rfc1123-date  ; see section 3.3.1 of[2]\n            last-modified     = rfc1123-date  ; see section 3.3.1 of [2]\n            expires           = rfc1123-date\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1285475"}, {"subject": "???G?????n?i?D?", "content": "HI,?A?????n???\n???b???^???v???\n\n???????o?{?@???K?O?????^??????,\nhttp://english.idv.st\n?W???o???O???}.\nhttp://vbb.learnhome.com/bbs/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=79\n?????????o???O??????.?????A?^???i?B??????,\n?????[?J?Q???a.?n?[?J???????R??.\n\n????,?p?G?A?{?b?b??20%???H???d,\n??????,?i?H?N?v??,?Q?v?u??6.6%.\n?O?i?D???A?b??20%???Q??...???r.\n?q???O:0927-984-036.?????O????.\n???????L,?L?|?H?????H???d?????????A.\n\n???A?^???i?i???t,\n???B?\\?????Q?????H???d.\n0927-984-036.?????O????\nSEE YOU THEN.\n\n????E?O:janetwu2121@yahoo.com.tw\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-12857069"}, {"subject": "????????????????????", "content": "ly\nContent-Type: text/plain ; charset=\"GB2312\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????

This is because both the shared\nsecret and dheader-content are ingredients of the entity-digest.  All\nthat we can hope to do is assure that the response was sent by someone\nwho knows the password.\n\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1304877"}, {"subject": "Low Cost Term Life Insurance                 L", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13052165"}, {"subject": "??????/????100????/??????&lt;????&gt; ??   `   ?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13058940"}, {"subject": "09:17:39 - ??????????????????  09:17:3", "content": "????????   deleteaddess@btamail.net.cn\n\n                     ????????\n1  ????????        2002-2003??          280??\n2  ????????        2002??               250??\n3  ????????        2001-2002??          200??\n4  ????????        2000-2002??          100??\n5  ????????        2000-2001??          100??\n6  ????????        2001??               70??\n7  ????????        2001-2002??          198??\n8  ????????        2001-2002??          160??\n9  ????????        2001??               120??\n10 ????????        2002-2003??          150??\n11 ????????        2001??               90??\n12 ????????        2002??               90??\n13 ????????        6??-7????????        100??\n14 ????????????    2002??      ??320??/??   ????320??/??\n15 ????????        1998????????????\n16 ????????        2001-2002??       ????\n17 ????(????????)  2002??               100??\n18 ????(????????)  2002??               80??\n19 ????????(????????2002??????)         300??\n20 ??????????????????-??????????(1.2)   40??\n21 ??????????????????-??????????(1)     20??\n22 ??????????????????-??????????        20??\n23 ????(????????)  2002??               80??\n24 ??????????????????              \n\n????????????????????????\n\n????????????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????   ??????315700\n??    ????0574-65761641  63370814\n??    ????0574-65761642\n------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                            \n??    ????????????????\n????????????????????????\n??????????3901340009000055822\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13065666"}, {"subject": "ADV:ADLT ?????????? ????????????..??????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13073456"}, {"subject": "[????] ??????????. ???????? ???", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13080053"}, {"subject": "[ietfswap] &lt;none&gt", "content": "DATA\nDATA\nTo: \nDate: Fri, 29 Mar 2002 17:41:50 PST\nSubject: FW: Candidates Needed\nMessage-Id: <200203291732544.SM00812@bmarchant.intellectmarch.com>\n\nIRG IS RECRUITING RECRUITERS\n*******************************************\nNo experience necessary.

I'm assuming\nthe sender and receiver agree on their shared secret.  The question I'm\nasking is, What's the purpose of dheader-content?\n\nI thought the original idea for dheader-content was that the receiver\ncould verify that the message headers were unchanged from what the\nsender had sent.  But we discovered that proxies, particularly, might\nchange the actual message headers.  So we created dheader-content, so\nthe information in the headers would be captured somewhere that proxies\nwouldn't muck with.\n\nBut, as far as I know, we haven`t said that the receiver should verify\nthat the stuff in dheader-content matches the stuff in the message\nheaders.  For example, we didn't say the first component ought to match\nthe received response status code.  (And it might not, because of\nintervening proxies.)\n\n\nIf we're not going to specify how to verify that the stuff in\ndheader-content matches the stuff in the message headers, then how does\ndheader-content differ from just some arbitrary nonce string that gets\ntossed into the digest?  And if that's all we're doing, then let's\nsimplify the specification and not pretend we're using headers.\n\nDave Kristol\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1315053"}, {"subject": "[????]????????,??????

It is ok if a proxy has changed them and they no longer\nmatch dheaders.  In this way the receiver can, for example, tell from\nthe dheader status code that the server acknowledges a successful PUT,\neven if some proxy has removed this information by changing the status\ncode.  Also a receiver can see that the origin server sent no Date\nheader (maybe no clock) and even though a proxy has added one, the\nreceiver knows not to use it when calculating the entity-digest.\n\n> But, as far as I know, we haven`t said that the receiver should verify\n> that the stuff in dheader-content matches the stuff in the message\n> headers.

The receiver\nshould not expect dheaders and actual message headers to match.\nIf the entity-digest checks out then the dheaders matched the\norigin servers headers.\n\n> \n> If we're not going to specify how to verify that the stuff in\n> dheader-content matches the stuff in the message headers, then how does\n> dheader-content differ from just some arbitrary nonce string that gets\n> tossed into the digest? \n\nThe main difference is that nonce is opaque and dheaders has\nsemantics.  The contents of dheaders is certifiably created by someone\nwho knows the shared secret.  We trust them to be telling us the true\nvalues of the origin headers: date, expires, l-m-d and status.  The\ndheaders field could not have been changed en route if the\nentity-digest checks.\n\n\n> And if that's all we're doing, then let's\n> simplify the specification and not pretend we're using headers.\n> \n\nMaybe \"origin-headers\" would be a better name.\n\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1324626"}, {"subject": "CES?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????~~[????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13264559"}, {"subject": "[????]?????????? ????????.?????? ????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13270998"}, {"subject": "????????  ????( ??????

I am ABDUL MOMOH, the son of NDIATA MOMOH, the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe. He was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network\nonline hence decided to write you. \n\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the\nsociety. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. \n\nIt is against this background that, my family and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and more so, have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to have such amount of money in any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction of such magnitude throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands.\n\nAs the first son, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them.  I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South \nAfrica for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. \n\nAs a businessman, I am seeking for a partner, who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands. I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist my family, and me all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangement with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands. I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought from South Africa to The Netherlands. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of \nownership of the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment.\n\nI have two options for you. Firstly I can give you certain percentage of the money for for agreeing to assist in this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. Contact me with this E-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this  transaction. \n\nThanks, GOD BLESS YOU\n\nYours Faithfully,\nAbdul Momoh.\n  \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13385823"}, {"subject": "???????????????????????????????????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13395013"}, {"subject": "[?? ??] ???????????? ???????? ?????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13401565"}, {"subject": "{ ???????? } ???????? ???? ???????? ???????? ????????.??????!!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13408181"}, {"subject": "SUPER BASE DE DATOS Y EMAIL", "content": "EXPERIMENTE PUBLICITAR SUS PRODUCTOS Y SERVICIOS LLEGANDO A MILES DE PERSONAS \nEN FORMA ECONOMICA Y PERSONALIZADA.\nASI COMO LLEGAMOS HOY A USTED, LLEGUE A OTROS CLIENTES Y CONSUMIDORES DE TODA \nLA ARGENTINA Y EL MUNDO, HACIENDOSE CONOCER EN FORMA AGIL, FACIL, SEGURA, \nY SOBRE TODO SIN GASTAR DINERO. \nPARA ESTO CONTAMOS CON UNA INMENSA BASE DE DATOS CON : \n\n1. 1.306.000 EMAILS ARGENTINOS (500.000 .AR), TOTALMENTE VERIFICADOS Y \n   CONTROLADA SU VIGENCIA.\n\n2. 2.000.000 DE EMAILS DE LATINOAMERICA, ESPA?A Y U.S.A., DIVIDIDOS POR PAISES.\n\n3. 532 EMPRESAS CON NOMBRE, TELEFONO, FAX, DIRECCION, LOCALIDAD, C.POSTAL,\n   PROVINCIA, NOMBRE DEL ENCARGADO, EMAIL, RUBRO Y CANTIDAD DE PERSONAL.\n\n4. 19.250 EMAILS DE CAPITAL FEDERAL DIVIDIDOS POR BARRIO, E INCLUYENDO ADEMAS \n   NOMBRE Y APELLIDO.\n\n5. 318 EMAILS DE INMOBILIARIAS CON NOMBRE, DIRECCION, LOCALIDAD, PROVINCIA,\n   C.POSTAL, TELEFONO Y RESPONSABLE.\n\n6. 815 EMAILS ARGENTINOS INCLUYENDO NOMBRE Y APELLIDO DE PERIODISTAS Y PRENSA.\n\n7. 33.001 EMPRESAS ARGENTINAS CON NOMBRE, DIRECCION, LOCALIDAD, C.POSTAL,\n   PROVINCIA, TELEFONO, FAX Y RUBRO.\n\n8.

Proxies\nmay add headers which were not originally present, may change them,\nor may \"canonicalize\" them.  All of these features would ruin a\ndigest.\n\nIt has proven difficult if not impossible to have the specification\nrequire that proxies not change all the headers people would like\ndigested.  My guess is that it is futile to try to specify a set of\nheaders which must always be digested and must not be changed by\nproxies.  At least the discussion so far has not shown anything like a\nconsensus on this.\n\nOn the other hand I agree that digesting arbitrary headers is highly\ndesirable.  Painful though it may be in terms of bandwidth, the only\nway I think this can be done is by replicating all the relevant origin\nserver headers in a field of the Authentication-info header.  Proxies\nare required not to touch the Authentication-info header.\n\nThis \"origin-header\" field would have a value which is a quoted string\nconsisting of the concatenation (with some separator) of the complete\nheaders which the sender wants digested.  This string would be included\nin the material digested to form the entity-digest.\n\nThis would have the advantage of being extensible as any new headers\nare added.\n\nI am not sure what a good separator would be; colon might not work\ntoo well.  Also I don't know what to do about headers containing\nquotation marks.  Perhaps something like %-escapes for colons, quotes\nand percents in the headers being concatenated and colon as separator?\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1345294"}, {"subject": "Cover Your Track", "content": "                                             Cover your Tracks\n\nWe at Bolder Computer Solutions have been looking for a software developer that has the state of the art software programs, at the right price, which can protect all of us on the Internet.

This string would be included\n    in the material digested to form the entity-digest.\n    \n    This would have the advantage of being extensible as any new headers\n    are added.\n    \n    I am not sure what a good separator would be; colon might not work\n    too well.  Also I don't know what to do about headers containing\n    quotation marks.  Perhaps something like %-escapes for colons, quotes\n    and percents in the headers being concatenated and colon as separator?\n\nWhat about specifying, instead, that the Origin-header field carry\nthe base64 encoding of the headers as they appear in the original\nmessage?  E.g., if the original response looks like:\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 13:39:48 GMT\nContent-Length: 36\nConnection: transfer-coding\nLast-Modified: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 13:39:40 GMT\nVegetable: Arugula, \"Corn on the Cob\";\"with-butter\"\nTransfer-coding: gzip\n\nand the origin server wants to digest the Content-Length, Last-Modifed,\nand Vegetable headers, it would compute the base64 encoding of\n\nContent-Length: 36\nLast-Modified: Wed, 31 Dec 1997 13:39:40 GMT\nVegetable: Arugula, \"Corn on the Cob\";\"with-butter\"\n\nand then send this base64 value in the \"Origin-header\" field.\n\nThis has the benefit that it\n(1) avoids all problems related to quotes and other special\ncharacters.\n(2) avoids the need to invent a new separator mechanism.\n(3) uses an existing encoding format, which is already\nemployed in Digest Authentication, so we know that\nthe implementations in question support base64.\n(4) is simple to specify.\n\nbase64 does expand the size of the encoding (33%).  It might\nmake sense to specify that the field carry the base64 encoding\nof a compressed form of the headers (using \"deflate\"?), which\nwould probably result in a net savings over the original header\nsizes.  But I don't think it's worth another food-fight over this\ndetail.\n\n-Jeff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1355714"}, {"subject": "????,???? ????:?????? ????????!???? ?????? ????!?????? ????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13560167"}, {"subject": "???????????", "content": "????????????\n    ????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????\n    ????????????????????????????\n    ????????????????????????????????????????\n    ??????????????????????\n\n\n       ????????????????????????????  \n       http://www.wanfusi.org   \n       http://www.wanfuchansi.cc/index2.htm\n       http://www.wanfuchansi.cc\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13567235"}, {"subject": "???\\?O?_?????|?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\ntext/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13573796"}, {"subject": "???????????", "content": "????????????\n    ????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????\n    ??????????????????????????????????????\n    ????????????????????????????????????????\n    ??????????????????????\n\n\n       ????????????????????  \n       http://www.wanfusi.org   \n       http://www.wanfuchansi.cc/index2.htm\n       http://www.wanfuchansi.cc\n       \n       \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n   ??????????????????SMTP????????????????????????????????????\n\n   ??????????????????PC????????SMTP??????????????????????????\n\n   ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n   ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n   ????????????????      http://www.seekeasy.onchina.net\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13580005"}, {"subject": "beauty jadeit", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13586992"}, {"subject": "?????????N?_?L&lt;FLASH???e????,?u?n?T??..?W?[?T?~?\\?O&gt;???????????????N?_?L&lt;FLASH???e????,?u?n?T??..?W?[?T?~?\\?O&gt;???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13592977"}, {"subject": "A eso..", "content": "            A eso de caer y volver a levantarte,\n            de fracasar y volver a comenzar, \n            de seguir un camino y tener que torcerlo, \n            de encontrar el dolor y tener que afrontarlo. \n            A eso..., no le llames adversidad, \n            ll?male...

But I have some reservations.  Actually\nbase64 is used in Basic authentication, but not in digest.  It is a\nmessy translation to implement because it requires manipulation of\nbits not just octets.  If we had it to do over again I would argue\nagainst its use in Basic authentication, in favor of something much\nsimpler with the same functionality.  Right now I suspect that most\nservers contain routines for decoding base64, but not encoding and most\nclients have routines for encoding and not decoding.  At least that is\nall that is used by Basic authentication.\n\nIf we imagine a day when Basic no longer exists there will be no\nneed for base64 in server or client.\n\nWhat about using something much simpler and more readable like \n%-encoding all non-alphanumerics in the headers?  This also\nexpands the size somewhat, but I think the advantages you list\nare worth the cost.\n\nJohn Franks\njohn@math.nwu.edu\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1387858"}, {"subject": "??????????????????,???????????????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13879166"}, {"subject": "???????????????????????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13885767"}, {"subject": "???????????????????????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13892218"}, {"subject": "?????", "content": ".......\n\n\n\n\ntext/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-13898570"}, {"subject": "itovice?? ?????? ???????? 5?? ??????

The objective of this proposed working group is to write\nstandards track RFC(s) for protocols using the currently available\nInternet drafts as a basis.  The SSL, PCT and SSH protocols are\nexamples of mechanisms of establishing a secure channel for general\npurpose or special purpose Internet applications running over a\nreliable transport, usually TCP.\n\nThe TLS working group is a focused effort on providing security\nfeatures at the transport layer, rather than general purpose security\nand key management mechanisms.  The standard track protocol\nspecification will provide methods for implementing privacy,\nauthentication, and integrity above the transport layer.\n\nThe work currently under way in the area of secure IP is outside the \nscope of this working group. Also, general authentication mechanism \ndiscussions are outside the focus of this group. However, best efforts \nwill be made to utilize as much as possible of the already existing \ntechnologies and methodologies in the IETF and other places to solve \ncommon problems, such as key management.\n\nThe group may also produce an informational RFC to describe conventions for \nthe interface to a Socket (or transport) layer secure library to build \nspecific applications as well as TCP port number conventions for running \nsecure versions of network applications.\n \nGoals and Milestones\n\nApril 96 Agreement on charter and issues in current draft.\n\nJuly 96  Final draft for Secure Transport Layer Protocol (\"STLP\")\n\nNov 96   Working group \"Last Call\"\n\nDec 96   Offer to IESG for IETF \"Last Call\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-14914741"}, {"subject": "test  please ignor", "content": "I hope this works\n\nHenrik\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1492315"}, {"subject": "Re: Revised Draft Charte", "content": "The charter looks good to me.

The TLS candidate sponsors should provide some guidance to the WG\nas to how they intend to address migration.  In the absense of such\nstatements, the charter should include the explicit claim that it does\nnot address migration.

Section 4 contains:\n\n    struct {\n        AlertLevel       level;\n        AlertDescription description;\n        AlertDetails     details<0..2>;\n    } Alert;\n\nwhere AlertDetails is a set of bits that can be OR'ed together, and are\nused only with the handshake_failure and no_certificate AlertDescriptions.\n\nI see why details might contain 0 or 1 bytes, but not when it\nmight contain 2 bytes.  I also question the complication of adding a\nvariable-length field; not only is it messier than a fixed-field structure,\nbut it also requires more data to be transmitted on the wire (since\nthe length must be sent).\n\nInstead, I propose that the Alert structure contain only the Level and\nDescription fields, but that the details be incorporated into the\ndescription codes.  It isn't obvious that anything is gained by being\nable to OR multiple detail codes - after all a fatal error is a fatal\nerror, and one reason is sufficient:\n\n    enum {\n        close_notify(0),\n        unexpected_message(10),\n        bad_record_mac(20),\n        decompression_failure(30),\n        cipher_mismatch(40), hash_mismatch(41), exchange_mismatch(42),\n           signature_mismatch(43), authentication_mismatch(44),\n           illegal_parameter(45),\n        bad_certificate(61), unsupported_certificate(62),\n           certificate_revoked(63), certificate_expired(64),\n           certificate_unknown(65), certificate_mismatch(66),\n           certifier_mismatch(67), combination_mismatch(68),\n        (255)\n    } AlertDescription;\n\n\n>\n> (6) Password authentication (particularly for clients) is extremely\n> desirable.

It may be acceptable at the application layer,\nfor example to control access to particular portions of a html document\ntree.  In that case, the basic authentication or digest authentication\noccur at the application layer, independently of whether transport layer\nsecurity is being used.  I don't agree that that layering scheme is\n\"not desirable\".\n\nNormally, protocol definitions should provide mechanisms, and configuration\noptions should be the means of enforcing policy.  However if the STLP\nis defined in such a way as to allow weak authentication, it will not\nbe meeting it's goals.  As stated in the SSL spec, goal number 1 is\ncryptographic security.  I hope most TLS working group members agree\nwith that.\n\nI strongly recommend that STLP contain no provisions for password\nauthentication.\n\n\n> (8) MD2 and MD4 need to be phased out owing to the detection of a\n> security problem.

I'd like to see more details, though.  Are you proposing that\nhandshake be done over a reliable connection and only support\napplication-data datagrams, or do you envision handshake / alert /\nchange-cipherspec over UDP?  If the former, what mechanism is used\nto get the client and server to switch from TCP to UDP and back?\nIf the latter, how do you propose handling lost/reordered/duplicate\npackets?\n\nThe ipsec work seems more suited to providing datagram security.\nThere is a real need, but I'm not sure STLP is the right vehicle.\n\n\nAs mentioned before on the TLS mail list, it would also be nice if\nthe STLP proposal would address:\n\n (11) Operation over normal port numbers, instead of special duplicate\nreserved ports for each application protocol (http, smtp, nntp, telnet,\netc).\n\n (12) Providing sufficient information to allow firewall proxies to\nauthenticate the client and server and enforce access control.\n\n\n> \n> 2.

When random numbers are used as secrets, the property of interest\nis \"randomness\" (unpredictability or entropy).  However, both the client-\nand server-generated challenges are exchanged in the clear, and once they\nare known, they are no longer unpredictable.  Thus \"preserving randomness\"\nis a non-goal for challenges.\n\nInstead, the useful property of challenges is that they not repeat over\nthe lifetime of the key pair (certificate) with which they are used.\nA truly random N bit number has a small but non-zero probability\nof repeating any particular value.  A challenge with a deterministic\ncomponent such as time or a sequence number has a zero probability of\nrepeating, as long as the sequential component is reliable.  But it is\nnearly impossible to guarantee that reliability, so challenges should\nhave both sequential and random components.\n\n\n\n> The connection state includes the following elements:\n>\n> Each party maintains separate sequence numbers for transmitted and\n> received messages for each connection.

I believe that this is a very good way to\namortize the bulk cryptography overhead over many sessions for some\napplications -- e.g., where images or text are being sold on a\nsubscription/per-item basis and the service provider would like to\nmake the data a little more secure so that network sniffers can not\ntrivially obtain it.\n\nIn such applications, reusing the same key for the data is not a big\ndeal, in that (1) while it exposes the data-encrypting key a little\nmore due to its being transferred to multiple recipients under\ndifferent session keys, it is up to the server to determine the amount\nof this kind of exposure prior to re-encrypting the data with a fresh\nkey, (2) malicious subscribers have the ability already to\nredistribute the data (or the key to the encrypted data, if the\nsubscriber has the ability to extract it from his/her browser).\n\nWhen the server is willing to send the data only if it is possible to\ntransmit it in encrypted form, there would be no extra storage\noverhead other than that for the bulk encryption key -- only the\npre-encrypted copy of the data would be needed -- and for most\ntransfers data may be streamed directly from the disk to the network\ninterface.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to pre-MAC'ing the data.\n\nI believe it is good to expose this encryption cost -vs- communication\nsecurity tradeoff to the Web server administrators, and I believe that\nit is generally useful for other \"data broadcast / publishing\"\napplications.  One problem with existing SSLv2 and PCTv1 Web servers\nis that the crypto overhead is sometimes unacceptably high, and this\nis one way to ameliorate this.\n\n-bsy\n\n--------\nBennet S.

The intent of the merged document is not as a\nproposed standard of any kind, it is provided just as a starting point\nso that the working group does not have to consider two different\nspecifications.\n\nThe document produced by Microsoft did not include any input from\nNetscape other than it is based completely on SSL 3.0 (without any hints\nfrom PCT). Microsoft suggested several modifications to the SSL3.0 spec\nthat they considered to provide added value to the spec. It was\ninteresting to see that the proposed \"closed\" discussion meeting appear\nin all magazines as the new Microsoft proposed STLP standard.\n\nAside from that, all the recommended changes to the SSL 3.0 spec either\ncause possible security holes, are unrelated to securing transport\nlayers or totally irrelevant.\n\nFor example one of the recommended (by Microsoft) changes is to support\ndatagrams (UDP) as well as TCP traffic. While having a secure version of\nUDP is a useful tool, it certainly does not belong at all to this\ndiscussion since the SSL protocol (and its variants including PCT) is\ndesigned assuming a reliable transport. Supporting UDP actually better\nbelongs to the IP layer security efforts because of the \"non-reliable\"\nnature of the datagram delivery.\n\nThere is also a request to change the signal called \"ChangeCipherSpec\"\nthat determines the starting point of the new agreed upon algorithms to\ninclude other values, that actually has the potential of breaking the\ndata stream since that signal is provided as a synchronization point\nbetween the client and the server to switch algorithms.\n\nThere were several editorial changes to the front half of the document\nthat made the document quite unreadable and therefore we did not finish\nanalysing the proposed changes to th protocol.\n\n\nSince Microsoft decided to use the SSL3.0 protocol as the basis for new\nfeatures, and for the sake of saving time, the TLS working group should review\nthe SSL3.0 spec as the starting point for the TLS discussions, and since\nthe IETF is truely an open forum, Micorsoft does have the opportunity of\npoposing any changes they see are advantageous to the funationality of\nthe protocol.

My\napologies for the confusion that has arisen.\n\nOn the whole, we're all talking about the same thing.  Our goal is to reach\na consensus on a protocol that fulfills the goals outlined in the draft\ncharter. When trying to nail down a protocol, some off-list discussions\namong document authors or potential document authors can be useful in\nresolving some details.  Some of those discussions inadvertently spilled\ninto other arenas, causing many of us to be unsure of what was going on.\n\nBecause the working group has an aggressive proposed schedule, and because\nsome of the details to be resolved were minor and required some initial\nagreement, several people were trying to get some of those details nailed\ndown quickly.  That's all.\n\nThe working group has not been constituted to rubber-stamp anything. On the\nother hand, there is great value in standardizing existing practice rather\nthan trying to invent something from whole cloth.  The goal of the working\ngroup is to agree on a transport layer security protocol as discussed in the\ncharter.  The important thing is that the working group comes to that\nconsensus, and that everyone with an interest has an opportunity to\ncontribute to that process.   Document authors often need to have side\nconversations to work out details, and that's part of the usual process.\n\nNow that lots of documents are floating around, however, we (as a group)\nneed to decide how to focus attention.  I'll check with authors of the\nvarious documents and make a proposal in a couple of days so we aren't too\ndiverted by different-but-similar documents.\n\nFinally, there were a few questions about details of the protocol we might\ncome up with, but I got a general sense that the the last draft charter was\nacceptable to the group.

The SSL, PCT and SSH protocols are examples of\nmechanisms of establishing a secure channel for general purpose or\nspecial purpose Internet applications running over a reliable\ntransport, usually TCP.\n\nThe TLS working group is a focused effort on providing security\nfeatures at the transport layer, rather than general purpose security\nand key management mechanisms.  The standard track protocol\nspecification will provide methods for implementing privacy,\nauthentication, and integrity above the transport layer.\n\nThe work currently under way in the area of secure IP is outside the \nscope of this working group. Also, general authentication mechanism \ndiscussions are outside the focus of this group. However, best efforts \nwill be made to utilize as much as possible of the already existing \ntechnologies and methodologies in the IETF and other places to solve \ncommon problems, such as key management.\n\nThe group may also produce an informational RFC to describe conventions for \nthe interface to a Socket (or transport) layer secure library to build \nspecific applications as well as TCP port number conventions for running \nsecure versions of network applications.\n \nGoals and Milestones\n\nApril 96 Agreement on charter and issues in current draft.\n\nJuly 96  Final draft for Secure Transport Layer Protocol (\"STLP\")\n\nNov 96   Working group \"Last Call\"\n\nDec 96   Offer to IESG for IETF \"Last Call\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-15280368"}, {"subject": "issues with the charte", "content": "From earlier discussion, there were several points about what the\ncharter might also include:\n\n1. security protocols for UDP\n2. producing a requirements document beyond the charter\n3. migration from existing protocols\n4. relation to proxies\n5. relevance of port numbers\n6. multiplexing connections over a single secure connection\n\nIt seems to me that the purpose of the charter is to nail down a few\nconcrete and achievable goals.

Support for pre-encrypted or pre-MAC'ed data is *only* an\nefficiency hack, and even then one with negligible or zero benefit over SSL.\n\nIf you want to pre-process data with a very secure implementation\n(in the Govt. we call it \"Type 1\" encryption), you're certainly free\nto do so.  SSL doesn't know or care whether the application-data\npresented to it is plaintext or super-encrypted; it's all treated\nthe same, using the current CipherSpec.\n\nMr. Yee suggests that pre-encrypting images can eliminate server\noverhead for bulk crypto, but I don't see how.  If you have a large\npre-encrypted file to transmit over SSL, then just renegotiate a\nNULL-WITH-NULL CipherSpec before sending the file, and resume the\nprevious CipherSpec when it's done.  The only overhead is for two\nhandshake exchanges, which shouldn't be a serious burden on the\nserver.\n\nOn the other hand, creating a totally separate set of handshake\nmessages to support pre-encrypted data is just another potential\nplace for security holes to pop up.  I admit to not having studied\nthe PCT 2.0 pre-encryption specs in detail, but before spending time\ndoing so I'd like to see answers to the following:\n\n1) How much time does the PCTv2 pre-encryption handshake save over\nthe standard SSLv3 resume-session handshake?, and\n\n2) if the answer to 1 is greater than epsilon, what analysis has been\ndone to show that the pre-encryption handshake does not introduce\nnew vulnerabilities to the protocol?\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-15315611"}, {"subject": "STLP &quot;implementation comments&quot", "content": "Some of the comments in the STLP draft are misdirected and have confused\nat least one implementor of SSL 3.

Perhaps Windows machines,\nbeing more recently network-aware, do not yet offer this common\nservice (along with echo, chargen, etc services) as standard\nconfiguration.  While I have not checked into it, I would imagine that\nany complete TCP stack implementation for Windows would include these\nkinds of common services.\n\nSo while the daytime service is not a _required_ service per se, it is\nso often provided that expecting much secrecy of the _precise_ time\nvalue is probably inappropriate.  (Figuring out the value to second\nresolution is not hard when network latencies range from a few to a\nhundred millisecond.)\n\nFurthermore, many machines use the Network Time Protocol (see RFC\n1589) to automatically synchronize their internal clocks with the US\ntime standard and automatically account for hardware clock drift.\nWhile this is not a requirement for Internet-aware machines either, it\nis not uncommon, and it is very likely to lower the amount of hardware\ndrifts / clock jitter that may be available/accessible to a user-level\nprogram.  While the clock chip is accessible directly from non-NT\nversions of Windows -- and thus the uncorrected values would be\navailable -- building in such an expectation of being able to use it\nas a source of randomness implies more kernel-level mods / new\ninstallable-drivers for several commercial OSes.\n\nAdditionally, it's not clear to me at all that the conjectured 3 bits\nof randomness is self-refreshing, i.e., whether it is used up on the\nfirst sampling or whether more randomness is available after one waits\na while (and how long?).  Clock chips may have spec'd variance within\na batch, and certainly the clocks may drift over time (at some spec'd\nrate), but the variance over time in the rate of drift for a\nparticular chip may be very small.  Certainly the manufacturer specs\nonly provide bounds that go the wrong way for this application!\n\n-bsy\n\n--------\nBennet S.

The problem is as\nfollows: the ChangeCipherSpec message is defined to send the key for\nthe pre-encrypted data.  If we want to claim that the encryption\nhardware is more secure than the host handling that connection, we\nshould not trust the host to properly encrypt the hardware encryption\nkey for transfer to the client either.  Certainly if the hardware key\nis encrypted with the TLS session key, the security of (the\npre-encrypted portion of) the channel is only as good as the worse of\nthe two keys.\n\nAs for the comment about Moore's law, I don't think we should rely on\nit to mask our inefficiencies.  We -should- worry about it when we\ndecide on things like key lengths, rather (but that's a different\ntopic.)  Yes, the pre-encrypted data idea is oriented towards reducing\nthe load on heavily loaded servers that need security, not their\nclients -- that's precisely the scenario that I had drawn in the first\nmessage.  While this is not a _general_ point-to-point transport\nsecurity issue, running TLS on web servers _is_ the main application.\n(People who want to use TLS for secure telnet is unlikely to care --\nthough the pre-encrypted data mechanism can benefit that as well when\nused with a slow stream cipher.)\n\nRegarding the idea of renegotiating for NULL encryption when sending\npre-encrypted data, that is not a good idea.  The idea of providing\nthe pre-encryption mechanism (also applies to the on-the-fly\ncompression found in SSLv3) is to hide the complexity from the\nclient.  Yes, if client programs are all smart and understand when the\ndata stream changes from normally encrypted traffic to\npre-encrypted-and-NULL-encrypted traffic, things would work, but the\npoint of providing the TLS abstraction is to hide such complexities\nfrom the clients.  After all, the clients could just as well do their\nown crypto.\n\n> 1) How much time does the PCTv2 pre-encryption handshake save over\n> the standard SSLv3 resume-session handshake?, and\n\nThese are apples and oranges.  Resume session provides a means to\navoid the public key crypto overhead while obtaining fresh session\nkeys.  These session keys are used to private-key encrypt the\ntraffic.  Because of the way these keys are derived, this mechanism\nforces on-the-fly encryption and decryption.\n\nThe pre-encryption mechanism assumes session keys are in place,\nregardless of whether they were derived from a complete handshake or\nfrom a resumed session.  The pre-encryption mechanism aims to avoid\nthe private-key encryption overhead for data that is (re)transmitted\nto many parties by permitting \"backend\" encryption at the server\n(change keys once in a while when machine is lightly loaded, etc).\n\n> 2) if the answer to 1 is greater than epsilon, what analysis has been\n> done to show that the pre-encryption handshake does not introduce\n> new vulnerabilities to the protocol?\n\nThe same kind of analysis that is due any security protocol -- review\nby security researchers/practitioners.  I don't know whether enough\nhas been done yet -- personally, I've looked at it for only a few\nhours (classes to teach, grants to apply for :), and haven't looked at\nthe protocol as a whole at all (there may be interactions between how\npre-encryption is handled and other parts of STLP.)\n\nI don't see anything wrong with the idea of making Web security\ntechnologies more scalable.

In particular, the data to be authenticated is hashed\nonce, and this result is then hashed again with the MAC key prepended. \nThis MAC method defends against all of the attacks against which HMAC is\ndesigned to defend, and has only the one (known) drawback that a\ncollision in the underlying hash function directly produces a collision\nin the MAC function.  It has the advantage, however, that the \"interior\"\nhash computation can be performed in advance.  (Note that the MAC must\nbe computed on the encrypted data, since the plaintext is not\nnecessarily available, and the MAC value itself will not be encrypted. \nThis changed order has no security impact, but makes MAC precomputation\ninfinitely easier to implement securely.)\n\nIn PCT v2, a special \"key management\" message is used to transmit an\nencryption key to be used to decrypt pre-encrypted data, which is then\nauthenticated as described above.  (Another \"key management\" message\nrestores the previous encryption key.)  In the STLP document, it was\nproposed that the \"change cipher spec\" message be used for the same\npurpose.  If that solution is unacceptable, then a compromise approach\nmight be to change the MAC function as described above, and to implement\npre-encrypted data support at the application level for encryption and\nat the protocol level for message authentication.  In other words, the\nencryption key would be transmitted as application data, the cipher spec\nwould then be switched (using an unmodified \"change cipher spec\"\nmessage) to null encryption with normal message authentication, and the\npre-encrypted data would be transmitted as if unencrypted, with the\nprecomputed interior hash values for MAC computation used to compute\nMACs quickly on the fly.\n\n>On the other hand, creating a totally separate set of handshake\n>messages to support pre-encrypted data is just another potential\n>place for security holes to pop up.

If the user never sets the clock on the client or server\nmachine, then even the checks for certificates being current will fail.\nSome error checking for egregiousl bad values can be done.\n\n3) The value of the time-of-day should be made available through the\nAPI.

I'm not\nsure that's really a big problem.  First off, more than one\nproposal for TLS-type protocols have included triple-DES\nas a symmetric cipher choice.  If I'm not mistaken, triple-DES\nis the strongest commonly-available symmetric cipher.  So the\npreencrypted data key would, if one used the best possible TLS\nciphertypes, be as secure as the preencrypted data itself.\nSecondly, the suggested MAC method to allow some pre-calculation\nof the MAC is not as secure as the Krawczyk method used in SSL3\n(and I would presume STLP).\n\nSo, I'm not sure that sending the pre-encrypted data's key\nvia TLS is any weaker than the preencrypted data itself, and I do\nsee a problem with using a weaker MAC method.  On the other hand, SSL\nalready has a method to deal with preencrypted\ndata, although it's not as streamlined as some would like.\nMy opinion would be that the cost of adding more to the protocol\n(time spent arguing about it here, plus time taken to comb over\nit looking for possible security holes) isn't worth the gains in\nthis case.  It's worth thinking about later as an addition to\nthe TLS protocol, but I'd rather see this WG get out something basic\nthat works soon instead of something complicated later.\n\n\n\n-- \nEric Murray  ericm@lne.com  ericm@motorcycle.com  http://www.lne.com/ericm\nPGP keyid:E03F65E5 fingerprint:50 B0 A2 4C 7D 86 FC 03  92 E8 AC E6 7E 27 29 AF\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-15481165"}, {"subject": "Re: Merged Transport Layer Protocol Developmen", "content": "Dan Simon wrote:\n> \n> UNIX time was not removed so that challenges would be more random, but\n> rather to preserve available randomness resources.

This alteration renders the MAC method virtually\nindistinguishable, cryptographically speaking, from the one I proposed;\nin particular, if the underlying hash function is not\ncollision-intractable, then this handshake hash, as well, will be\nvulnerable to collision attacks.\n\nThe reason for their modification of the MAC method in this case is\nobvious:  to avoid having to keep all the handshake messages around\nuntil the MAC key is exchanged.  The overhead would have been minor\n(compared to the cost of repeatedly encrypting huge data streams), but\nit was enough to prompt the \"weakening\" of the MAC method in this case.\n\nPersonally, I agree with this decision, because I believe the modified\nMAC method to be quite sufficiently secure--much, *much* more so than,\nsay, the effectively 40-bit-key-based MACs that would typically result\nif pre-MAC keys had to be sent at the application layer, as suggested by\nsome opponents of explicit support for pre-encrypted data.\n\n>So, I'm not sure that sending the pre-encrypted data's key\n>via TLS is any weaker than the preencrypted data itself, and I do\n>see a problem with using a weaker MAC method.

But I can't.  And that\nmeans that passwords will continue to be widely used *regardless* of\nwhat we do.  Moreover, a large fraction of those passwords will, for\nreasons we're all familiar with, be sent (or used to compute\nauthentication responses sent) over connections only protected by 40-bit\nencryption keys.  Passwords used in that manner are subject to offline\nbrute-force attacks, first on the 40-bit encryption, then second (if\nnecessary) on the password-based response.\n\nOn the other hand, if we incorporate password authentication into the\nprotocol, then we can protect those passwords by basing the\nchallenge-response protocol on both the password and the\nautomatically-strong MAC key exchanged during the handshake.  This will\nprotect the password from offline attacks, making even a poorly chosen\npassword a useful security tool (assuming that it's kept secret, and\nthat the server doesn't permit unlimited online trial-and-error\nattacks).\n\nThat's still not as secure as public-key cryptography, of course.

Password-based\nauthentication is only permitted for either the client or the server\n(*not* both), in conjunction with a public-key-based key exchange. \nMoreover, a password-based authentication response may not be sent\nunless the accompanying key exchange either uses the other party's\ncertified public key or has already been incorporated into the other\nparty's (certified) digital signature-based authentication response. \n(These conditions ensure that only the correct \"other party\" knows the\nmaster key used in the password-based authentication response.)

If the market wants to use passwords\ninstead of certificates, they're going to do so. The alternatives appear to\nbe either negotiating an unauthenticated session and having the application\nlayer do the password authentication or allowing the transport layer to\ndeliver the password as a part of the negotiation. I think that allowing\nthe latter is acceptable for the following reasons:\n 1) It allows a standardized method of communicating passwords; this moves\nwidely divergant code out of a variety of dependant protocols and\ncentralizes it.\n 2) It allows applications which use the secure transport layer to\ngeneralize their authentication; they don't need to special case password\nauthorization on top of an unauthenticated session.\n 3) It allows us to standardize a more secure method of password\ncommunication; this will avoid applications creating methods which require\nthe password to be sent over the wire and stored in RAM (even if it is sent\nover a secure link, it will be delivered into the application layer in\nplaintext).\n 4) It need not impact security. A password-authenticated session can still\nbe completely private (a network snooper or a man in the middle should have\nno more, and possibly less, chance of access to the contents of a\npassword-authenticated session when compared to an unauthenticated\nsession).\nHowever, I think password authentication should be an option only available\nto the client side of the session. (If the end result protocol is as\nasymmetric as current ones are.)\n\nJust to be clear, I'm discussing password authentication; I do not\nrecommend using the password as a part of the negotiation of the encryption\nkeys or IVs.

It does indeed tend to\nviolate layering boundaries, and the mere act of handing out the same\nkey to many recipients smacks of bad cryptographic hygiene.  (On the\nother hand, handing out the same data, pre-encrypted or not, to many\nrecipients is unlikely to do wonders for its confidentiality in any\nevent.)  The question is whether some people would be willing to accept\nthese penalties in order to reduce server CPU loads.\n\nMy understanding is that the number one complaint of secure server\noperators is the enormous CPU drain (and consequently huge throughput\nreduction) caused by the public-key operations associated with\ntransport-layer protocols.  There is little that can be done about this\nproblem, but for servers that send out large data streams,\npre-encryption would at least avoid exacerbating it.\n\nConsider, for instance, a server with a mixed clientele requesting both\nlarge data streams and small ones.  Using the figures that Tatu Yllonen\nand I were batting around, a megabyte of data requires about a second of\nCPU time on a Pentium to process--about the same as ten RSA decryptions.\n Hence every megabyte of (non-pre-encrypted) data sent reduces by about\nten the number of \"low-volume\" clients who may connect to the server\nduring that transmission.  This seems to me like a performance problem\nthat many servers would be willing to pay a substantial price to\nalleviate.\n\nIt would be nice if we could simply delay this decision until after the\nworking group has produced an initial protocol; unfortunately, if\npre-encrypted data is *ever* to be supported, then a MAC method must be\nchosen *now* which makes the later specification of a pre-encryption\nfeature possible.

The point is that the collision-intractability of the underlying\nhash function is, in practice, a necessary condition for the security of\n*any* of the proposed MAC methods, including HMAC.  If you don't believe\nthat, say, SHA is collision-intractable, then you shouldn't use it as\nthe (sole) basis for any of the known hash-based MAC methods.  (That is\nwhy I brought up the question earlier of whether MD5 should be listed as\na hash function choice at all, given recent questions that have arisen\nabout its collision-intractability.)  On the other hand, if you *do*\nbelieve that SHA is collision-intractable, then the MAC method used in\nPCT, or for the SSL v3.0 handshake hash, is quite sufficient.  (One\ncould, it is true, consider a more subtle definition of\ncollision-intractability which, if met, would make a hash function\nacceptable for HMAC but not for the MAC method used in PCT; however,\nmost of us would probably agree that discovery of an efficient\ncollision-finding algorithm for a cryptographic hash function would be\nsufficient reason to reject it for use in either MAC method.)\n\nIn short, I see absolutely no reason for treating the \"handshake hash\"\nany differently from other MACs; both must be secure under the normal\ndefinition of a MAC.  And the MAC method used in the SSL v3.0 \"handshake\nhash\" has that property, as long as the underlying hash function\n(whether MD5, SHA or a combination thereof) is collision-intractable. \nThe same can be said of the method used for general message\nauthentication in PCT.\n\nDaniel Simon\nCryptographer, Microsoft Corp.\ndansimon@microsoft.com\n\n\n>\n>\n>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-15778407"}, {"subject": "Re: Password Authenticatio", "content": "Bennet Yee writes:\n> \n> I agree with most of your points about passwords.

The SSL 3.0 philosophy seeks to\ndesign a redundant system that can withstand a single failure but then\nrequires a patch to regain the redundancy.  The STLP strawman philosophy\nallows a failure to compromise the system, but allows it to be fixed by\na simple configuration change on the part of either party.  Both\nphilosophies have merit.\n\nIncidentally, the handshake hashes in the final version of the SSL spec are\ncomputed as (MD5(MD5()) + SHA(SHA())), not (MD5(SHA()) + SHA(MD5())) as in\nearly versions.  We felt that not alternating algorithms provided at least\nthe same level of collision intractability without the somewhat dubious\nmixing of algorithms that you seem to be concerned about.  The assumption\nthen is that the algorithms are sufficiently unrelated so as to provide\nuncorrelated outputs.\n\n>>> after all, the new break affects not only the MAC method, but also\n>>> (hash-and-)signature-based authentication, where no secret MAC key can\n>>> be relied upon to make collision-finding harder.\n>>\n>> What are you talking about?

It seems to depend fairly strongly on the collision\nintractability of the hash function.  I also agree with you that everyone\nshould move away from MD5.

Much of that time was devoted to\nanalysis of the cryptographic properties.

Implementers and\nadministrators are then free to support SHAMD5--perhaps *only*\nSHAMD5--as their hash function of choice (for handshake and signature\nauthentication, or even for general use).  Alternatively, the protocol\ncould negotiate a \"primary\" and \"secondary\" hash function, so that\nredundant MAC constructions could continue to be redundant into the\nfuture (unlike the SSL v3.0 \"redundant\" construction, which now turns\nout to be much less redundant than it was originally thought to be).

There \nwere plenty of comments and many of these along with some of the work \nwe did with PCT are reflected in SSLv3.

Understandable - SSL is your protocol and \nyou've got code to write, after all.  \n\nBut now we're at a different stage in the standards-setting process. \n We're talking about an Internet Standard, and comments/contributions \nshould come from the whole Internet community.  Frankly, only a small \nsubset really cares, but from what we've seen so far, there are more \nthan a few who want to show up in person to work on what will become \nTLS.   We all seem to agree that SSLv3 is a good starting point, but \nthe robust discussions on the TLS list point out the need for some \nmodifications/improvements before we call it TLSv1.  \n\nThis kind of collaboration has got to be the best way to get a \nwidely-endorsed (and implemented!) standard quickly.  That's the whole \nreason we're coming and why we're not building a bunker around PCT and \njust defending it.

But what we \ncan do in this meeting  - and in subsequent discussions on this list - \nis to get more people thinking and commenting. The working group should \ntake full ownership of the protocol, and this is a great time to start.\n\nThe meeting is at the Garden Court in Palo Alto on May 29th.

As I had said in response to Taher, I must have missed the\ninitial call-for-participation messages.  (I don't subscribe to\ncipherpunks and had heretofore avoided mailing lists.  Still don't\nlike 'em much. :)\n\nAnyway, SSLv3 may very well be a reasonable base.  Perhaps the STLP\nmodifications were too extensive or too one-sided (i.e., due to\nMicrosoft's desires), but since STLP was actually based on the SSLv3\ndraft, it seems to me that we *are* growing SSLv3 -- the argument is\nreally over whether the STLP changes to SSLv3 are needed.  And we had\na healthy argument/discussion going for a while.\n\nI am less sanguine than you about the impact of future changes in the\nprotocol.  When this WG publishes the TLS protocol, products will be\ncreated based on it, and that is likely to become a large installed\nbase.  How many SSLv2 clients are out there still (older Mozillas or\nothers), even when your company kindly gives away Mozilla for free (at\nleast to us academics)?  And consider the installed base of servers,\nwhich may or may not be free.  There is a significant cost to upgrade,\nthough maybe it's good for business :).  This is just for the Web --\nTLS is supposed to be broadly applicable to transport level\napplications, so presumably we'll also see TLS-based telnet, nntp,\nsmtp, etc, etc, broadening the installed base.\n\nThe issue of protocol revision is still important nonetheless, even if\nwe assume there is zero cost to the user to upgrade.  While we are not\ndealing with APIs in this WG directly, recalling the\nSSLref&SSLv2->SSLv3 transition, it behooves us to *at least* write\ndown what sort of revisions are being considered for the next rev (as\nmuch as is feasible) so that the APIs may be designed to accommodate\nthese changes.  Myself, I'd prefer to see this WG (or a subsequent\none) specify some minimal core API (for Unix, Windows, and MacOS), so\nthat we wouldn't run into these problems in the future, or at least\nrun into them once for everybody rather than multiply in various\ndifferent ways for various vendors / freeware implementations.  If we\ndon't do this and we do a protocol revision, we'll have to tread on\nice to avoid breaking the various flavors of APIs lest one vendor\ndecries foul because a change impacts -their- API more than their\ncompetitors.  And we'll see more politics.\n\nAfter all, as I see the issue of change control, a lot of the politics\nis about the impact of revisions on time-to-market.  (Certainly true\nof HTML tags.)  It's unfortunate that as scientists / engineers that\nwe have to deal with these business issues, but we should face reality\nsquarely and deal with it as best we can.  And I think that by\nthinking ahead about the need for added features, revisions, and\nconsidering API design issues, we would best serve the industry by\navoiding future politics.\n\n-bsy\n\n--------\nBennet S.

I have written more than one\nimplementation of the GSS-API and I participate in the\nCAT WG. (Oh, BTW, I don't speak for my employer. :)) The\nGSS-API can be considered a success, a failure, or\nmediocre, depending on your point of view.\n\nA GOOD POINT\nBy far the GSS-API's (IMO) best point is that it is a\nstandard. As a standard, it is a valuable check mark on a\nMIS manager's budget approval list.\n\nA BAD POINT\nOnce a standard, customers hold you to the standard, even\nwhen it is broken.\n\nA MEDIOCRE POINT\nThe applicability of the GSS-API is limited. In simple\nclient/server applications the GSS-API is useful\nbecause it is a simple API (20 functions); however, in\ncomplex client/server environments it is not useful\nbecause it is a simple API -- it doesn't account for\nmulti-threading.\n\nCertainly we can argue forever in the day the points of an\nIETF sponsored API. We can do the same for a protocol too.\nI'm not convinced there is a difference between an API\nstandard and a protocol standard.

It then controls access to transport \nlayer networking (who can access which applications, what security \nservices must be enforced, which algorithms and key sizes must be \nused, etc...) through ties to the system's underlying security policy.  \nAlthough a security-aware user or application can request specific \nsecurity services and algorithms, such requests cannot override \nsecurity policy.\n\nIn order to provide such pervasive security, Hannah implements\ntransport security services within the protocol stack.  This can best \nbe achieved when there is clean separation between the actual transport\nlayer security protocol and its supporting key management and \nauthentication -- the approach taken by SDNS's SP4, OSI's TLSP, and \nother previous attempts to \"standardize\" transport layer security.\n\nI believe that a simple set of requirements can easily reconcile these\ndifferent approaches to transport security such that they can be \ninteroperable:\n\n- - Specification of two independent protocols:\n\n1) A transport layer security protocol that provides for security-\n   enhancement of network communications above the transport layer\n   using a set of cryptographic keys supplied by some outside\n   mechanism.  This should be designed such that it is independent\n   of (2) allowing for the potential replacement of (2) at some\n   future date.\n\n2) A key management and authentication protocol to support (1).\n   This protocol need not be generic for supporting other IETF\n   efforts such as IPSEC.  It is hoped that a unified IETF key \n   management protocol will eventually emerge to supercede this \n   protocol.\n\n- - Although initial default algorithms should be specified, the design of the \n  protocols should be independent of any specific cryptographic algorithms \n  to permit potential future upgrade.\n\n- - The design of the two protocols should permit two possible modes of \n  operation:\n\n1) intermixed over a single communications channel (in-band key \n   management) similar to the current operation of SSL and PCT.\n\n2) over independent communications channels (out-of-band key\n   management) as suggested by existing transport security\n   standards.\n\nHannah's protocols (public domain, available at previously mentioned URL)\nmeet these requirements today.

It is not multi-level\nsecurity, obviously, since there's no data labelling and the node\nmanagement functionality apparently provide basic, low level access\ncontrol for network connections.\n\nI briefly looked at http://www.secureware.com/papers/pakmp/pakmp.ps,\nand have some questions.  It is a 65 page document that dives quickly\ninto the layout of the packets and does not seem to include a high\nlevel description of the cryptographic protocols used.\n\nOn page 13, it states that Family C \"provides key management using\nDiffie-Hellman\", and that \"authentication is achieved by having each\nside encrypt a nonce with the public key of the peer and having the\npeer return the decrypted value.\"  Presumably with RSA, since that\nparagraph mentions RSA later, and presumably the nonce, both\nRSA-encrypted and not, are actually sent over a channel encrypted with\nthe key derived in the D-H exchange.  Later sections that I found on\nFamily C had only \"TBD\" (4.4, pg 46).\n\nNow, this sort of authentication is subject to a man-in-the-middle\nattack, unless the D-H keys are somehow certified and the RSA\ncertificates are linked to the D-H certificates.  This is a very\nimportant requirement that does not seem to be stated anywhere.\nNow, pg 22 mentions PKCS3, so it does not appear that you're using\nthe pair-wise fixed keys scheme but rather D-H with global p,g to\nobtain a shared secret the value of which neither side controls.\n\nWithout something stronger than plain D-H, we can have the following\nscenario: Alice and Bob wishes to communite.  Guy is the man in the\nmiddle.  G pretends to be B to A (denoted G_B), and at the same time\npretends to be A to B (G_A).  G performs two independent D-H key\nexchanges with A and B (as G_B and G_A resp) to obtain two shared\nsecrets k_a = g^{r_a r_{g_b}} mod p and k_b = g^{r_b r_{g_a}} mod p\nrespectively.  Now, suppose A wishes G_B to authenticate his identity\nas B.  G_B can not do this directly, since he lacks Bob's RSA private\nkey (d_b).  However, when A sends her nonce r_n^{e_b} mod n_b, it is\nover the channel encrypted with k_a -- the D-H derived key Alice\nbelieves that she shares with Bob.  Guy can easily obtain r_n^{e_b}\nmod n_b, of course, since he has k_a.  Now G re-encrypts this value\nwith k_b and sends it to B (acting as G_A).  B decrypts using secret\nkey cryptosystem key k_b, decrypts using RSA to obtain r_n, and\nreplies with r_n over his secret-key protected channel.  Straight to\nG, who can forward it to A.\n\nThis is a simple, standard textbook-example MITM attack that I'd\nexpect any of my students to understand and avoid.

The big issue is whether the session\nkey establishment (or Security Association management) protocol should\nbe cleanly separated from the traffic protection protocol.  Both Hannah\nand IPSEC provide entirely separate protocols for key management and\ntraffic protection; SSL and PCT provide partial separation by having a\n\"Record Layer\" distinct from the \"upper layers\" (handshake, alert,\ncipherspec, and application-data).\n\nThe key point is that the traffic protection code (Hannah's NDSEP,\nIPSEC's AH and ESP, SSL's record layer) is relatively small and easy\nto implement, (although it must be carefully designed).  It can be\nbuilt into each application, or be stuffed into the network stack\nand shared by all applications, whichever you prefer.\n\nBut the key management protocol (Hannah's PAKMP, IPSEC's ISAKMP) is\nbig, complicated, and requirements are rapidly evolving.  It makes\nsense to fully de-couple the two protocols so that:\n 1) a single KMP can be shared by all network layers - IP,\n    transport, and application,\n 2) evolution in key management technology can be accommodated\n    without replacing all the software that has it hardwired in, and\n 3) each application can be a *lot* smaller.\n\nHow much of the code in Netscape Navigator or MS Internet Explorer\nis dedicated to web browsing, vs. the amount dedicated to handshaking\nand certificate management?  The latter is just overhead, and the\nmore flexible it becomes, the more the code bloats.\n\n\n> Maybe Microsoft wouldn't care (;-), but Hannah's implementation -- as\n> described in the white paper -- requires in-kernel modifications on\n> Unix hosts (Hannah is only available HPUX and SCO -- for Windows\n> Hannah takes over the Winsock DLL to control the network connections).\n> This is contradictory to one of the (perhaps implicit) goals of being\n> usable on all popular systems.

If\nthe kernel uses Streams networking (Solaris, for example) the\napplication can just push another Streams module onto the stack.\n\nAs mentioned above, it doesn't really matter if the Record Layer\ncode is built in to the application or the stack - it isn't that\nlarge.  If it isn't in the stack, you can't force all applications\nto use it, but it's a lot easier to build applications that do.\n\nI strongly recommend that the TLS working group define separate\nprotocols for traffic protection and key management.  As Mr. Watt\npointed out, it's not necessary to wait for IPSEC to standardize\nISAKMP/Oakley before getting products to market, we just need to\nmake the TLS handshake protocol (whatever it turns out to be)\npluggable.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-16341216"}, {"subject": "Re: Missing requirement", "content": "In message <9605221722.AA01417@mordred.sware.com>, Charles Watt writes:\n> \n> You missed the entire point of my message, which had nothing to do with\n> any specifics of our Hannah product.

Certainly a\nbetter system results when good protocol design is coupled with good\nsystems engineering.

You seem to want everybody to use\nthe Hannah-provided certified namespace and nothing else.  I think\nthat's impractical.\n\nI argue that because DNS is not secure, something needs to be done in\norder to link the namespaces together.  We have the certified names in\none namespace, and DNS names in another.  If the Hannah protocols were\nto be used, the application (e.g., Web browsers) will speak in one\nnamespace (DNS names), but the secured transport that Hannah provides\nwill talk in another (fully certified names).  If I give you an URL\n(which contains a DNS name) and your browser ends up connecting to a\nfully certified agent, that agent may or may not have the expected\ncorrespondence to the DNS name.  How the DNS name is \"resolved\" to the\nHannah certified name must be verified.  If your applications are\nHannah-aware and deal only with certified names, fine.  If your\napplication thinks in one namespace that doesn't trivially map into\nthe Hannah-supplied certified namespace, then we've still got a\nproblem.\n\nTo provide security with application transparency, after the\nauthentication protocol runs -- which authenticates in the certified\nnamespace -- the implementation should try to make sure that the name\nsupplied by the user -- which is a DNS name or a raw IP address -- has\nsomething to do with the authenticated peer.\n\n-bsy\n\n--------\nBennet S.

There is no way to implement either\none except by bundling them together over the same communication channel.\nThey should be designed to support both in-band and out-of-band key\nnegotiation so that they can support datagram-based services and higher\nassurance implementations.  This is not difficult to do, and the current\nversions of SSL and PCT could be easily modified to meet these requirements\nmuch like Hannah (NDSEP/PAKMP), IPSEC (IPSEC/Oakley), SP4 (SP4/KMP) and\nother similar systems.\n\n> \n> If what you're looking for is to explicitly name the record layer one\n> protocol and the key exchange/management layer another protocol,\n> that's fine.

They are handed out first come, first \n   serve.  If a customer connects to www.llbean.com, are they connected\n   to the famous mail order company or an imposter?\n\n2) Because DNS is insecure, an attacker can, at least within an isolated\n   region, assume any domain name they choose.  If they can convince any of\n   the standard CA's supported by Netscape that they are www.netscape.com,\n   or convince the user to accept a new CA, then they are netscape.\n\n3) Do you suggest similar rules for client certificates?  If so, it is \n   unreasonable for me to be identified as watt@sware.com if I am also \n   watt@mindspring.com and watt@directpc.com.  If not, then the protocol \n   is worthless for many applications such as banking where it is perhaps\n   more important to identify the client than the server.\n\nMy own opinion on this matter is that resolving authenticated name to\nDNS name is a non-issue.  Who cares what domain name L.L. Bean uses for\ntheir server as long as I am sure I am talking to L.L. Bean when I place\nmy order.  Establishing this assurance cannot be achieved by linking\nthe certificate name to the domain name.  I would prefer to encode\nadditional identification information in the certificate extension fields,\nwhich can be verified by the CA during certification and displayed in \nconvenient, human readable format.  But what ever scheme is chosen, the \ncrux of the trust issue boils down to whether or not you can trust the \nother guy's CA to properly identify and register those entities that \nit certifies. \n\nBut this is not a protocol issue and this is not the forum for deciding \nsuch issues.\n\n\n> \n> To provide security with application transparency, after the\n> authentication protocol runs -- which authenticates in the certified\n> namespace -- the implementation should try to make sure that the name\n> supplied by the user -- which is a DNS name or a raw IP address -- has\n> something to do with the authenticated peer.\n\nHow does this work with mobile IP?\n\nCharles Watt\nSecureWare, Inc.\n-----END PRIVACY-ENHANCED MESSAGE-----\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-16366908"}, {"subject": "Re: May 29th Meetin", "content": "Tom,\nTwo questions about the meeting on May 29:\n1.

And while\nthere's no public cryptanalysis of RC4 (the only cipher used in\npractice for https:) that tells us the maximum stream length that we\nshould use prior to changing keys yet (unicity distance, etc), a\nmechanism should exist to allow the record layer -- which has the\ninformation about how long has the cipher been used as well as the\nnumber of records sent -- to likewise signal to the key management\nlayer that a new key should be used.\n\nThis necessarily implies that a synchronization record must exist to\nseparate the data records that were encrypted using an old key and\nthose encrypted using the new, or that a key-ID be incorporated in the\nheader.

And if we simply include a few fields in the records such as\na variable sized cipher-specific data (new stream keys [encrypted] /\nkey ID and new IV), then we can make it UDP-capable and make Charles\nand other folks happy.  Datagram support was, I believe, one of the\ngoals of PCTv2 and STLP (see STLPCiphertext's key_info member).  We do\nhave to think hard about what to do w/ datagrams that are delayed --\nwith stream ciphers and a new stream key per message, every datagram\nimplicitly incorporates a change-key operation; with block ciphers (in\nCBC mode), all that needs to change on a per-datagram basis is the IV,\nso a refresh-key operation makes sense.  For block ciphers, then, the\ndatagram header should have either a new key and IV, or a key ID (use\nexisting key) and new IV -- and we have to worry about datagrams that\nare delayed so they arrive after the encryption keys have been\nupdated.  Do we discard them, or do we decrypt them and pass them on\nto the application?  Since UDP allows datagram duplication, loss, and\nreorderings anyway, I'd say to drop 'em.\n\n-bsy\n\n--------\nBennet S.

(I think it's important to get\nour terminology straight in order to think clearly and communicate\neffectively.)  You're right that a cipher in CFB mode does not suffer\nfrom the simple reorigination attack that a true stream cipher does,\nthough the more sophisticated attacks that you allude to are still not\ndifferential cryptanalytic attacks.  Typically CFB is used for cases\nwhere self-synchronization is needed to limit the effects of\ntransmission errors (not a requirement w/ TLS traffic, since except\nfor malicious packets we can assume that the CRCs will work okay); we\nalso don't need error propagation, since we separately check the MAC\non the data.\n\nThere are attacks that are possible (if we allowed the same keys to be\nused for different sessions) that are simpler than differential\ncryptanalytic attacks.  Certainly applications where a few gibberish\nblocks are tolerated (true for some data formats where there are\nfields that are \"don't care\" or unused by the viewing application,\ne.g., comment text fields in various image formats) are potentially at\nrisk: using the same key for multiple sessions would open us up to\nreplay attacks -- because MAC computation only depend on the record\nsequence numbers (and the common MAC key and the current record's\ndata), if the record boundary happens in one of these \"don't care\"\nfields then an attacker may substitute records from a different\nsession (but the same record number) into the current session: the\nsubstituted data would MAC-check okay, and the cipher will\nself-synchronize and as long as the \"don't care\" region is large\nenough (a block or so) the substituted data would also decrypt okay.\n\nThis is not a problem for rebroadcasting the same pre-encrypted /\npre-MACed data, of course, since there's only one data stream.\n\nOh, thank you for correcting my mistake wrt ISO OSI terminology --\nI've been thinking that that particular TSAP is just a thinly veiled\nNSAP and such trivial interface pass-throughs doesn't \"count\".  (It's\nbeen about 10 years since I looked carefully at ISO OSI RM.)\n\nAs for whether I have objections about UDP, the point of my messages\nwas that I -don't- object to making the protocol usable for UDP, just\nthat we need to examine the complexity-versus-functionality\ntrade-offs.  I don't think it's a \"given\" that we should (or should\nnot) support datagrams.  Others on this list had objected to the\nMicrosoft STLP strawman, which was basically SSLv3 with PCTv2\nextensions -- mainly datagram support and the ability to\npre-encrypt/MAC data for low security data distribution applications\nsuch as (Web-based) bulk/multimedia data distribution -- because of\ndisagreements over the trade-offs.  I like the bulk data distribution\nfeature, though I'd prefer if HMAC was retained.  The datagram support\nisn't bad either, though as I had pointed out in a previous message,\nthe interaction of rekeying and datagram support hadn't been\ncompletely thought out.\n\nFor your applications, Charles, would STLP suffice?  This would be a\nuseful (though single) data point wrt what the consumers of the TLS\nprotocol design want.\n\n-bsy\n\n--------\nBennet S.

One is to keep plain-text versions\nof the file off the disk of the distributing site. This has the\nadvantage of protecting the file from those that manage to get\nunauthorized read access to the contents.\n\nThe second reason for special-casing pre-encrypted files is that there\nmay be a performance advantage for the distributor of the file if the\nidentical contents needs to be made available to multiple recipients.\nIt is this latter reason that seems to motivate the desire to include\nthis in the TLS proposals.\n\nThere are several issues to keep in mind while folding this support\ninto the existing SSL specification. None of them are compelling\nreasons not to do the work.\n\nThe record layering model will end up being reflected all the way up to\nhow the pre-encrypted file is stored on the disk.  SSL records are\nlimited to 16K bytes and each fragment is separately MACed.\n\nThe STLP proposal suggests a particularly weak MAC algorithm merely to\nallow the MACs to be (mostly) precomputed for the pre-encrypted files.\nWhatever protocol this group ends up with will be used to support more\nprotocols than merely HTTP. The correct MAC algorithm to use is HMAC\nwhich will soon (if not already) be an RFC. The (potentially) weaker\nintegrity requirements for some files (say images) that are broadcast\nmany times, does not allow us to weaken that integrity check for all\ndata for all higher level protocols.\n\nIf I have time, I'll say more about MACs in a subsequent message.\n\nThe STLP proposal had the new encryption key arriving in the\nChangeCipherSpec message. This is a mistake. The ChangeCipherSpec\nmessage is NOT a handshake message; it sits directly on top of the\nrecord layer so that there is explicit separation of the different\nsub-protocols. It also means that there can be a number of changes\nstaged for triggering at a single point.\n\nThe STLP proposal also used the security of the current stream to\nprotect the new encryption key. This leads to problems if the stream is\ncurrently at a less secure mode (null encryption or 40-bit encryption)\nthan the required security of the new data. You do have to be careful\nnot to increase the entropy of a current key above that allowed by\nU.S.  export laws. (This is extremely unfortunate for an international\nprotocol, but that is the reality of the situation.)\n\nThe STLP proposal includes a stacking method to recover an earlier key\nvalue. There is no indication of the stack limit that implementations\nmust support.\n\nA more straightforward approach would be to add another SSL handshake\nmessage: set write key. Since the two ends already share a 128-bit\nmaster key, the originating end could use a new salt together with the\ncurrent master key to compute a hash and an XOR offset from the desired\nnew encryption key. This could be used by either end and would take\neffect when the next ChangeCipherSpec message was sent. It has the\nadvantage of not leaking a subsequent key when the previous was\ncompromised. (Keeping the appropriate (according to U.S. export rules)\namount of entropy in the new key is left as an exercise to the reader.)\n\nIt might be tempting to try and transmit a constant (for a file across\nall users) MAC key using the same method used for the encryption key,\nbut this would be a mistake.  An earlier recipient of the file would\nthen have enough information to successfully pull off a MITM attack\nagainst a later recipient.\n\nThere may be a need to be able to set the compression method as well as\nthe encryption key.  You could either assume that the compression\nmethod will not change for a particular stream (meaning that the server\nmay have to keep multiple copies of the pre-encrypted file ready) or\nyou could introduce another handshake message that would allow the\nserver to choose among the compression methods originally proposed by\nthe browser.\n\nPK\n--\nPhilip L.

However, what you are\nproposing is basically an ad-hoc cipher: use the master secret to\nselect a one-way function (function generated/selected via hashing &\npseudo-currying); compute the image of a stream of plaintext \"salt\"\nvalues under this one-way function, which is then used as a stream\ncipher pad to encrypt the new bulk data encryption key.

Cryptographic \"Linking\" of the Password with the Master Secret\n\nIf password authentication is supported, there are three general\napproaches:\n\n1)  Send the password (hashed under the Randoms) encrypted under\n    the standard encryption key.  Advantage:  Cleaner, simpler,\n    can be done by clients without altering the protocol.\n    Disadvantage:  Someone can break the encryption key then\n    attack the password using brute force.\n\n2)  Send the password hashed under the master secret or some\n    value derived from it.  (I don't necessarily recommend the MAC \n    secret; its job is to protect data from being altered, and \n    probably shouldn't be used for other things.

HTTP applications are not required\n    to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such\n    understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST\n    understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first\n    digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the\n    x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an\n    unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached.\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.

SASL framework allows a\nclient to select an authentication mechanism from the list of mechanisms\nsupported by a server. This document is the next logical step after HTTP\nBasic and Digest authentication.\n\nFirstly, I would like to solicit an input from the HTTP community about\nthe document and its approach.\n\nSecondly, I would like to request some suggestions about the use of HTTP\nOPTIONS.\nThe problem is better described using the following example. Imagine a\nclient that tries to post some data to a server using the POST method.\nAlso imagine that the server requires authentication using SRP SASL\nmechanism when posting to the requested URL. Now SRP authentication\nrequires multiple exchanges between client and server. If the document\nbeing posted is big, it is unwise to include its body with every\nauthentication step. The proposed solution is to use the OPTIONS method\n(with no body) instead of the POST for the duration of the\nauthentication exchange. Is it a legitimate use of OPTIONS method? From\nthe description of OPTIONS (in RFC 2616) the proposed usage seems\nappropriate:\n\n   The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the\n   communication options available on the request/response chain\n   identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to\n   determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource,\n\n   or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action\n   or initiating a resource retrieval.\n\nThe following protocol example illustrates what was said above:\n\n  C: POST http://classified.example.com/classified/feedback-form.pl\nHTTP/1.1\n     Host: classified.example.com\n\n     ...Request body...\n\n  S: HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n     WWW-Authenticate: SASL\n              mechanism=\"DIGEST-MD5,GSSAPI,CRAM-MD5\",\n              realm=\"testrealm@example.com\",\n              id=\"0001\"\n\n  C: OPTIONS http://classified.example.com/classified/feedback-form.pl\nHTTP/1.1\n     Host: classified.example.com\n     Authorization: SASL\n              mechanism=\"DIGEST-MD5\",\n              id=\"0001\"\n\n  S: HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n     WWW-Authenticate: SASL id=\"0001\",\n\nchallenge=cmVhbG09ImVsd29vZC5pbm5vc29mdC5jb20iLG5vbmNlPSJPQTZNRzl0\n\nRVFHbTJoaCIscW9wPSJhdXRoIixhbGdvcml0aG09bWQ1LXNlc3MsY2hhcnNldD11dG\n                YtOA==\n\n  C: OPTIONS http://classified.example.com/classified/feedback-form.pl\nHTTP/1.1\n     Host: classified.example.com\n     Authorization: SASL id=\"0001\",\n\ncredential=Y2hhcnNldD11dGYtOCx1c2VybmFtZT0iY2hyaXMiLHJlYWxtPSJlbHdvb2\n\nQuaW5ub3NvZnQuY29tIixub25jZT0iT0E2TUc5dEVRR20yaGgiLG5jPTAw\n\nMDAwMDAxLGNub25jZT0iT0E2TUhYaDZWcVRyUmsiLGRpZ2VzdC11cmk9Im\n\nltYXAvZWx3b29kLmlubm9zb2Z0LmNvbSIscmVzcG9uc2U9ZDM4OGRhZDkw\n                ZDRiYmQ3NjBhMTUyMzIxZjIxNDNhZjcscW9wPWF1dGg=\n\n  S: HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n     WWW-Authenticate: SASL\n              id=\"0001\",\n\nchallenge=cnNwYXV0aD00YjJiYjM3ZjA0OTEwNTA1Nzc3YzJmNjM4YzkyMjcyNQ==\n\n  C: POST http://classified.example.com/classified/feedback-form.pl\nHTTP/1.1\n     Host: classified.example.com\n     Authorization: SASL id=\"0001\"\n\n     ...Request body...\n\n  S: HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n      WWW-Authenticate: SASL id=\"0001\"\n\n     ...Response Document follows...\n\nComments?\n\nRegards,\nAlexey Melnikov\n__________________________________________\nR & D, ACI Worldwide/MessagingDirect\nRichmond, Surrey, UK\nPhone: +44 20 8332 4508\nHome Page: http://orthanc.ab.ca/mel\n\nI speak for myself only, not for my employer.\n__________________________________________\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1965229"}, {"subject": "RFC 2616 errata: invalid language tag &quot;x-piglatin&quot", "content": "Hello,\n\njust a minor error:\nIn RFC 2616 chapter 3.10 \"Language tags\", there is the text:\n\n\"Example tags include:\n\nen, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin\"\n\nHowever, the language tag \"x-pig-latin\" is invalid because the subtag is\nmore than 8 characters long and contains a \"-\" (only ALPHA is allowed).\n\nPlease CC me in replies to the HTTP WG list as I am not subscribed.\n\nRegards,\n-- \nSven Neuhaus                                     email sn@neopoly.com\nNeopoly AG                                       phone +49 231 964560\nhttp://www.neopoly.com/                          fax +49 231 96456 69\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-1976884"}, {"subject": "Re: RFC 2616 errata: invalid language tag &quot;x-piglatin&quot", "content": "Hello Sven,\n\nThe syntax rules say:\n\n         language-tag  = primary-tag *( \"-\" subtag )\n         primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA\n         subtag        = 1*8ALPHA\n\nPlease note the '*' in the first rule, meaning repetition\n(from zero times up).

Testing the \"remove\" part is easy. I am\ntrying to come up with a good case for HTTP/1.1 proxies that tests the\n\"ignore\" part.\n\nThe short version of my question is: \"Can anybody come up with a\nreal-world case or at least a sane example, where the ``and ignore''\npart of the lower requirement would matter?\" On other words, can one\nauto-detect that the proxy is not ignoring the headers it removes?\n\nFor details, please read on.\n\n\nSo, I want to construct an HTTP/1.0 message with a header that, if not\nignored by the proxy, will cause some auto-detectable or traceable\naction. Ideally, I need to do that for both requests and responses.\nThis is a black-box testing.\n\nI cannot find any good headers that test the \"ignore part\". I assume\nthat the original message was generated by an HTTP/1.1-aware agent and\nforwarder via an HTTP/1.0 proxy that does not understand Connection:\nand uses HTTP/1.0 message version. Connection: header field MUST NOT\ncontain end-to-end headers, so I want to use hop-by-hop headers and\nextension headers when forming the test message. Moreover, any sane\nproxy will ignore any extension header so true hop-by-hop headers are\nthe only ones left. They are:\n\n      - Connection\n      - Keep-Alive\n      - Proxy-Authenticate\n      - Proxy-Authorization\n      - TE\n      - Trailers\n      - Transfer-Encoding\n      - Upgrade\n\nFurthermore, I need a header that is not supported by HTTP/1.0 proxies\nand that requires some detectable action from an HTTP/1.1 proxy.\nAuthentication headers are very cumbersome to test with. Remaining\nheaders are:\n\n- Connection\n- Transfer-Encoding\n\n\"Connection: Connection\" is obviously not useful in this context.\n\n\"Connection: Transfer-Encoding\" is not good either because if HTTP/1.0\nproxy ignored (and hence forwarded) Transfer-Encoding, things are\nalready pretty broken, and the HTTP/1.1 proxy should probably notice\nTransfer-Encoding and react in some way other than ignoring it!\n\nThus, I am tempted to conclude that no remotely possible real-world\nscenario would produce a combination of headers where violating the \"and\nignore\" part of the RFC requirement would break things more than\nhonoring that requirement.\n\nCan anybody confirm or provide a good example where honoring the\n\"and ignore\" requirement would be detectable?\n\n\nThank you,\n\nAlex.\n\nP.S. I can build a test case by putting end-to-end headers such as\n     Vary or Cache-Control into a Connection field, but that is quite\n     unrealistic and violates HTTP/1.1.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-2026402"}, {"subject": "IE vs vary heade", "content": "Hi,\n\nseems that it's an old and well-known issue ([1]) that Internet Explorer\ncan't handle Vary headers correctly when passing content to external\napplications.

Also, as somebody suggested to me off-list, you can\ntry a must-revalidate cache-control directive so that the content is\ncachable by shared caches but the server has some control based on\nclient request headers.

A message body may be of zero length, of\ncourse:\n\n   4.4 Message Length\n\n   The transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body as\n   it appears in the message; that is, after any transfer-codings have\n   been applied. When a message-body is included with a message, the\n   transfer-length of that body is determined by one of the following\n   (in order of precedence):\n\n   1.Any response message which \"MUST NOT\" include a message-body \n     [ does not apply ]\n\n   2.If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.41) is present\n     [ does not apply ]\n\n   3.If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present,\n     [ does not apply ]\n\n   4.If the message uses the media type \"multipart/byteranges\",\n     [ does not apply ]\n\n   5.By the server closing the connection. (Closing the connection\n     cannot be used to indicate the end of a request body, since that\n     would leave no possibility for the server to send back a response.)\n     [ applies! ]\n\nIf this is a response for, say, HEAD request, then (1) above applies.\n\n> Mozilla seems to opt for the latter; as far as I could work out from\n> 2616 the former is correct - a request may or may not include a message\n> body... the presence of a message body is signalled by a\n> Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header (or implicit for HEAD, 204,\n> 304 etc)... so no T-E or C-L implies no message body.\n\nNot sure what you are saying here, but no T-E or C-L does not imply no\nmessage body. The above headers are from a response, not from a\nrequest.\n\nFor requests, it looks like RFC 2616 implies that a request for which\nitems 1-4 do not apply is invalid. This is natural not only because\nthere is no way for the server to respond if EOF is detected (there\nmay be a way if half-closed or non-TCP connections are considered),\nbut because it is a bad idea for the server to act on a possibly\ntruncated request. For example, a POST depositing \"$10000\" may result\nin a \"$10\" deposit...\n\n$0.02,\n\nAlex.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-2332618"}, {"subject": "Re: HTTP/1.1 response with no headers", "content": "On Thu, Jul 11, 2002 at 09:55:23AM -0600, Alex Rousskov wrote:\n> \n> On Wed, 10 Jul 2002, Joe Orton wrote:\n...\n> > Mozilla seems to opt for the latter; as far as I could work out from\n> > 2616 the former is correct - a request may or may not include a message\n> > body... the presence of a message body is signalled by a\n> > Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header (or implicit for HEAD, 204,\n> > 304 etc)... so no T-E or C-L implies no message body.\n> \n> Not sure what you are saying here, but no T-E or C-L does not imply no\n> message body.

And this is a problem because the definitions of\nGET, HEAD and DELETE do not mention an entity-body, so they\ndon't \"explicitly allow\" one, but they also don't forbid one.\n\nThe method definitions for OPTIONS, POST, PUT mention entity\ndefinitions and (for POST and PUT) their semantics.

I was stating the requirement as it is currently\nwritten -- separating server and client responsibilities.  The message\nparsing algorithm does not know about method semantics aside from\nHEAD responses.  Whether or not a body is included with GET is not\ndetermined by the method semantics -- a server that does not anticipate\nand correctly parse a GET request with a body is not compliant with\nthe protocol.\n\nAdding yet another requirement to HTTP just to say that a\nclient MUST NOT send a body with GET, HEAD, DELETE, etc., will not\nchange the interoperability of the current protocol and it absolutely\nmust not change the message parsing algorithm (the example that Jeff\nwas talking about).

Many proxies violate a subset of test cases\nthat includes an artificial proxy-to-server delay. Looking at the\nresults, I think that the proxies are doing the \"right thing\" and the\nRFC has a problem.\n\nI will start with a specific example when current_age formula\nfrom the RFC yields a way-too-conservative and unnatural result (100%\nerror). I will then describe the problem and suggest a fix.\n\nI understand that a way-too-conservative age does not lead to\nstale documents being returned. However, if we want proxies to be\ncompliant, we may want to fix/mention the problem in the errata or\nelsewhere. Otherwise, the more problems like that are left unaddressed\n(ignored), the more difficult it would be to convince implementors to\npay attention to the RFC.\n\nPerhaps I got it all wrong, please check!\n\n\nA simple example\n----------------\n\nHere is a real and simple example that detected the problem with the\noriginal current_age formula from \"13.2.3 Age Calculations\". The\nabsolute values of timestamps below (\"0\" and \"7\") have no\nsignificance.\n\n   time event\n   ---- ------------------------------------------------------------\n    0.0 client request generated\n    0.0 client request reached the proxy, it is a MISS\n    0.0 proxy request to origin server is generated\n    0.0 proxy request reached the origin server\n    0.0 server response generated with Date correctly set to 0, no Age header\n    -- a network delay of 7 seconds --\n    7.0 server response reached the proxy\n    7.0 proxy cached the response\n    7.0 proxy forwarded the response\n    7.0 the response reached the client\n    7.0 another client request for the same URL generated\n    7.0 client request reached the proxy, it is a HIT\n    7.0 proxy must compute Age header value, see math below\n\nFollowing RFC 2616:\n\n    age_value = 0             (the cached response has no Age header)\n    date_value = 0            (the cached response has Date set to 0)\n    request_time = 0          (the proxy generated request at time 0)\n    response_time = 7         (the proxy received response at time 7)\n    now = 7                   (the current time is 7)\n\n    apparent_age = max(0, response_time - date_value) = 7\n    corrected_received_age = max(apparent_age, age_value) = 7\n    response_delay = response_time - request_time = 7\n    corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age + response_delay = 14\n    resident_time = now - response_time = 0\n    current_age   = corrected_initial_age + resident_time = 14\n\nThe true age is, of course, 7 and not 14. The above formulas just double true\ncurrent age in the case of a network delay between the proxy and the origin\nserver. The fixed formula (see below for the discussion) does not:\n\n current_age = now - min(date_value, request_time - age_value) =\n             = 7 - max(0, 0 - 0) = 7\n\nN.B. If the proxy computes Age header for misses and uses that as\nage_value when serving hits, the formulas yield the same result.\n\n\nThe Problem\n-----------\n\nRFC 2616 says:\n\n   Because the request that resulted in the returned Age value must have\n   been initiated prior to that Age value's generation, we can correct\n   for delays imposed by the network by recording the time at which the\n   request was initiated. Then, when an Age value is received, it MUST\n   be interpreted relative to the time the request was initiated...\n   So, we compute:\n\n      corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age\n                            + (now - request_time)\n\nI suspect the formula does not match the true intent of the RFC\nauthors. I believe that corrected_initial_age formula counts\nserver-to-client delays twice. It does that because the\ncorrected_received_age component already accounts for one\nserver-to-client delay. Here is an annotated definition from the RFC:\n\n   corrected_received_age = max(\n     now - date_value, # trust the clock (includes server-to-client delay!)\n     age_value)        # all-HTTP/1.1 paths (no server-to-client delay)\n\nI think it is possible to fix the corrected_initial_age formula to\nmatch the intent (note this is the *initial* not *received* age):\n\n   corrected_initial_age = max(\n     now - date_value,                # trust the clock (includes delays)\n     age_value + now - request_time)  # trust Age, add network delays\n\nThere is no need for corrected_received_age.\n\n\nMoreover, it looks ALL the formulas computing current_age go away with\nthe above new corrected_initial_age definition as long as \"now\" is\nstill defined as \"the current time\" (i.e., the time when current_age\nis calculated):\n\n   current_age = corrected_initial_age\n\nSo, we end up with a single formula for all cases and all times:\n\n current_age = max(now - date_value, age_value + now - request_time) =\n             = now - min(date_value, request_time - age_value)\n\nIt even has a clear physical meaning -- the min() part is the conservative\nestimate of object creation time. We could rewrite for clarity:\n\n  creation_time = min(date_value, request_time - age_value);\n  current_age = now - creation_time;\n\n\nAm I missing something important here? If I am right, and the current\nformulas count server-to-client delays twice, is it worth mentioning\nin the errata or elsewhere as a bug? Or should we insist that\nimplementations use current_age calculation from the RFC anyway?\n\nThank you,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-2687971"}, {"subject": "24hour old misse", "content": "Hi there,\n\nRFC 2616, Section 13.2.4 \"Expiration Calculations\" contains\nthe following MUST:\n\n   The cache MUST attach Warning\n   113 to any response whose age is more than 24 hours if such warning\n   has not already been added.\n\nThe context of that MUST is expiration calculation and, hence, cache\nhits.

Authors intention is always secondary to the\nreleased RFC. Intentions are somewhat important only when the RFC is\nnot clear or presents implementation problems. The current wording in\nquestion is very clear, unambiguous, and presents no more problems\nthan parsing the rest of HTTP control structures, right?\n\n> unless someone can explain why it is a necessary \"feature\".\n\nIt is not a feature, it is an \"absence of an exception\" (an exception\nthat you want to make). The current format is simply consistent with\nother HTTP parsing rules. Marking just this particular definition as\nan error needs more justification than lack of server-side support,\nIMHO. If lack of support is important, the protocol would require a\nmajor revision (to be consistent) since many HTTP features are not\nwidely supported.\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-2885957"}, {"subject": "Re: RFC2616 errata: HTTP-Version should be casesensitiv", "content": "> I did not (and cannot) check all the internals, but I am sure that\n> those intermediaries that are tested for (and interested in) HTTP\n> compliance will support \"http/1.1\" strings since it will be one of the\n> test cases.

Can a 304\n    response be ever \"consistent with\" an If-Range field?\n    \nIt would have been helpful to note the specific section number from\nRFC2616.  This particular text is in 13.3.4 (Rules for When to Use\nEntity Tags and Last-Modified Dates) and isn't meant to be normative\nwith respect to what status codes are valid under other circumstances.\nThat is, this is an extra restriction (imposed when a request has\nmultiple conditions), and can't be taken as implying a lack of\nrestrictions in other cases.\n\nMy guess is that we (I?) wrote this without fully thinking through\nwhether If-Range could ever return (\"be consistent with\") 304.\nBut on the \"better safe than sorry\" principle, I see nothing\nreally wrong with this paragraph.\n\n    Can a 412 response be ever \"consistent with\" an If-Range field?\n\nConsider at least this case:\n\nGET /foo.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: whatever.com\nIf-Range: *\nRange: bytes=100-200\n    \nRemember that section 14.27 (If-Range) informally defines If-Range\nas a sort of combination of GET+If-Match+Range, followed by a plain\nGET if the If-Match fails.\n\nSection 14.24 (If-Match) says:\n\n   If none of the entity tags match, or if \"*\" is given and no current\n   entity exists, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method, and\n   MUST return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response. This behavior is\n   most useful when the client wants to prevent an updating method, such\n   as PUT, from modifying a resource that has changed since the client\n   last retrieved it.\n\nAll of the other language that defines what 412 really means\nlooks a lot like this.\n\nTherefore, I suppose it is plausible that if \"/foo.html\" simply\ndoesn't exist, then 412 is \"\"consistent with\" If-Range.  However,\nthis seems to be a nonsensical special case (why not simply return\n404 here, and in any case what does \"If-Range: *\" mean?) so I think\nwe can rule it out.  The other reason for returning 412 with a\nplain If-Match (none of the entity tags match) is precisely the\ncase where If-Range wants the server to return 200.\n\nThus, I don't think If-Range should ever give rise to a 412 response,\nexcept in this one probably nonsensical example for which a 404\nresponse would be more appropropriate.\n\nBut again, this is not really the point being addressed in section\n13.3.4!\n\n    And a related question regarding proxy behavior; RFC 2616 says:\n    \n       An HTTP/1.1 caching proxy, upon receiving a conditional request that\n       includes both a Last-Modified date and one or more entity tags as\n       cache validators, MUST NOT return a locally cached response to the\n       client unless that cached response is consistent with all of the\n       conditional header fields in the request.\n    \n    What does \"return a locally cached response\" mean exactly? Does it\n    include returning a 304 response (cached headers, no content)? Or just\n    responses with locally cached _content_ (such as 200 and 206\n    responses, but not 412).\n\n(Again, we're in 13.3.4.)  This is one of those places where the\nterminology (\"response\") used in RFC2616 fails us.  (I won't rehash\nthat debate here.)  I think the most reasonable interpretation of this\nparagraph is that a cache entry of any sort (i.e., with any status\ncode) is useless if it's not consistent with all of the conditional\nheader fields in the request.\n\nThis follows my basic philsophy about caching: if there's any\ndoubt, don't use a cache entry; contacting the origin server\nmight be slow but it won't give the wrong content or headers.\n    \n    I find it curious that all \"If-*\" sections in the RFC have \"the\n    behavior when both If-Foo and If-Bar are present is undefined\"\n    clauses, _except_ for the If-Range section.

On the other hand, we made an\nexplicit decision (discussed on the mailing list, if my memory\nis correct) not to list in the spec all possible combinations of\nheaders that were not meaningful.  The fact that we did list a\nfew specific \"undefined\" combinations does not mean that all\nother combinations are reasonable!\n\nAnyway, I can't think of any reasonable interpretation for this\nexample:\n\nGET /foo.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: whatever.com\nIf-Range: \"a\"\nRange: bytes=100-200\nIf-Match: \"b\"\n\nNote that unlike \"If-Match\", which can carry many entity tags,\nIf-Range is explictly defined to carry only one validator.

There are more than 500 test cases\ncovering everything else, including Cache-Control handling. For the\nmajority of [caching] MUSTs it is possible to test in a more\nspecific/direct way when the cache has to act on stored content.  The\nabove is simply a workaround because we seem to be hitting an\n\"undefined behavior\" ground when many If-* headers are combined in a\nrequest.\n\n> I'm also assuming that you limit your testing to GET/HEAD methods,\n> since nobody has really worked out how HTTP caches deal with PUTs or\n> POSTs in all possible cases (except by simply forwarding these).\n\nHmm... RFC 2616 has a few MUSTs related to non-GETs and caches/proxies\nthat we do test. For example, some proxies retry POST requests, many\nproxies cannot handle chunked POSTs, and most caches do not invalidate\ncached entities mentioned in *Location request headers.  Co-Advisor\ncan detect those MUST violations quite well.\n\nWe do not do formal protocol verification though (as opposed to Adam\nBradley's research).

Imagine that\nthere is a non-HTTP/1.1 cache upstream that cached the response for more than\n24 hours. Imagine that the requesting client agent supports Warnings but does\nnot analyze response age.

It looks like the answer depends on\n    whether \"it is interesting\" to add this Warning to a miss. That is,\n    whether there is any \"use\" in attaching such a Warning. You think\n    it is not useful because cache heuristics do not apply to misses. I\n    think one could consider it being useful because the Warning could\n    be about upstream cache's heuristic, not about the cache adding a\n    Warning. See below.\n    \nYou asked \"Did the author(s) intend for the [specified] MUST to apply\nto HIT responses only?\".  My answer was intended to convey what\nthe *current* specification requires and why, not whether it might be\na good idea to expand the specification.\n\nAlso, note that the terms \"upstream\" and \"downstream\", as defined\nin RFC2616, probably mean something different than how you are\nusing them.  I think by \"upstream\" you mean \"inbound\" (i.e.,\ncloser to the origin server).\n\n    > I can't see any reason to Warn anyone on a miss that creates\n    > a new cache entry with a heuristic expiration lifetime\n    \n    The only reason I can think of is the \"garbage in, compliance out\"\n    principle:  the proxy should improve the \"quality\" of responses it\n    forwards.  Imagine that there is a non-HTTP/1.1 cache upstream that\n    cached the response for more than 24 hours. Imagine that the\n    requesting client agent supports Warnings but does not analyze\n    response age. If a compliant proxy adds a Warning (that the\n    upstream cache should have added, but did not!), the user will get\n    a useful Warning.\n\n    The above scenario is quite artificial, of course. I am not sure\n    whether it is good enough to say that the MUST in question should\n    apply to misses.\n\nRemember that RFC2119, \"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate\nRequirement Levels\", says\n\n   Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care\n   and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is\n   actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has\n   potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For\n   example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method\n   on implementors where the method is not required for\n   interoperability.\n\nYou're right that the scenario seems like a weak reason to add\nanother MUST or SHOULD to the spec.\n\nI'd be inclined to fix this problem by asking why a client that\nis capable of dealing with Warnings is not \"analyzing the response\nage\" (which seems like a basic requirement of the spec.)\n\n-Jeff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3007446"}, {"subject": "{VIRUS?} Cellpaddin", "content": "Content-Type: application/octet-stream;\nname=xsCookie[1].htm\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nContent-ID: <EM72qRN46L0a6b6584>\n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\nb3JkZXI9IjAiPjwvdGQ+PC90cj48L3RhYmxlPjwvYm9keT48L2h0bWw+\n\n\n\ntext/html attachment: stored\n\ntext/plain attachment: VirusWarning.txt\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3083070"}, {"subject": "RFC 2396 and SMB URL", "content": "I've  been working with a guy doing an SMB URL IETF draft because my client\nuses  it.  SMB is MS's file and printer sharing protocol (e.g. net use, Map\nnetwork  drive ...). I have a problem and I was hoping your experience with\nHTTP URLs might help us. \n\nWe  want  to use a URL like 'smb://' to denote the top of the network which\nwould  be  used  exclusively to list workgroups. Listing 'smb://WORKGROUP/'\nwill  list  all servers that are members of that workgroup. Other than that\nthese SMB URLs are like most others:\n\n  smb://miallen@server/share/path/to/file.doc\n\nMy  problem  is that my Java client uses the standard java.net.URL class to\nparse  URLs  which parses everything ok except for these top level 'smb://'\nURLs  and URLs composed from 'smb://' as a context URL and a relative path.\nFor example: \n\n  smb://                --> smb:\n  smb:// + WORKGROUP/   --> smb:/WORKGROUP/\n  smb:// + //WORKGROUP/ --> smb://WORKGROUP/\n  smb:////              --> smb://\n\nYou  can  see that this breaks our current model a bit. If a user creates a\nURL with 'smb://' the various java.net.URL.getXxx methods return: \n\n     authority: \n          file: \n          host: \n          port: 139\n          path: \n         query: null\n           ref: null\n      userinfo: null\n  externalform: smb:\n        string: smb:\n\nI  can  override  the arguments so that passing 'WORKGROUP/' is substituted\nwith '//WORKGROUP/' before passing it to the default parser. That works ok,\nand  makes  sense. I can trap the 'smb://' case and pass 'smb:////' too but\nthis gives: \n\n     authority: \n          file: //\n          host: \n          port: 139\n          path: //\n         query: null\n           ref: null\n      userinfo: null\n  externalform: smb://\n        string: smb://\n\nAs  you  can  see  this  hack makes the file and path '//' which makes less\nsense  to  me.  Does  this  behavior agree with RFC 2396? I find it hard to\nbelieve  Sun got it wrong. If java.net.URL is right then what should proper\nsemantics be for a URL like this? \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated,\nMike\n\n-- \nA  program should be written to model the concepts of the task it\nperforms rather than the physical world or a process because this\nmaximizes  the  potential  for it to be applied to tasks that are\nconceptually  similar and, more important, to tasks that have not\nyet been conceived. \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3090531"}, {"subject": "Does anyone have copies of the &quot;DEC Proxy Traces&quot;", "content": "We had a disk disaster a few months ago, which wiped out\nall of the trace files reachable from\n\n        ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/traces/proxy/tracelist.html\n        ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/traces/proxy/tracelistv1.2.html\n\n(this host is currently known gatekeeper.research.compaq.com and\nat one point was known as ftp.digital.com, although that site has\nnow been split off to serve other purposes.)\n\nI might be able to get these back from a backup tape, but it could take\na while to track down the right tapes, unfortunately.

RFC 2616 says:\n\n   All HTTP/1.1 applications MUST be able to receive and decode the\n   \"chunked\" transfer-coding, and MUST ignore chunk-extension\n   extensions they do not understand.\n\nSupport for the above MUSTs varies, and there are known buffer overrun\nbugs in some older versions of popular clients and servers. Many\n_servers_ have quite poor support for chunked _requests_, but you\nprobably do not care about that.\n\n> Or Is the chunking capability to be advertised by the client before\n> the server can send chunked encoded response?\n\nThe only required \"advertisement\" is \"HTTP/1.1\" request version.\nClients MAY include TE request-header to indicate that it supports\n[other] transfer-codings and/or trailers. However, the \"chunked\"\ntransfer-coding is always acceptable, regardless of TE header presence\nand value. Some clients send \"TE: chunked\" anyway. Some HTTP/1.0\nclients send \"TE: chunked\" to indicate that they can accept chunks\ndespite being HTTP/1.0.\n\nThe client should advertise its \"trailers\" capability though:\n\n   The presence of the keyword \"trailers\" indicates that the client is\n   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding, as\n   defined in section 3.6.1. This keyword is reserved for use with\n   transfer-coding values even though it does not itself represent a\n   transfer-coding.\n\nHTH,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3302127"}, {"subject": "206 as a result of weak IfRang", "content": "Hi there,\n\n\nRFC 2616, section 10.2.7 (206 Partial Content) says:\n\n   If the response is the result of an\n   If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT\n   include other entity-headers;\n\nThe above implies that it may be OK to respond with partial content to\nan If-Range request that uses a weak validator.

In other\nwords, section 10.2.7 seems to be documenting specifics of the\nbehavior that is prohibited in section 13.3.3 because, according to\n13.3.3, weak If-Range should never match and the server

of applications. There are many ways to \"support\" RFC\n2616 and, hence, there are many design decisions you have to make:\n\n- client/server/proxy \"side\" of your stack; do you\n  need to support all sides or a specific side?\n- how much control do you want the user to have?\n  is the user concerned primarily with sending or\n  receiving content? do they need tight control\n  over content cachability, expiration, types, or\n  even individual HTTP headers?\n- is performance important?\n- is portability important? are code size and memory\n  footprint important?\n- do you need to support caching inside your code?\n  do you need to provide enough hooks for external\n  caching?\n- is ability to act in the middle of an HTTP\n  transaction important? what about on-the-fly\n  content generation and/or modification?\n- is ability to support [external] authentication\n  important? do you need to support \"https\"?\n- etc.\n\nYou do not have to start the design from scratch though. It is a good\nidea to study existing interfaces, especially those that are close to\nyour problem domain. There are several obvious sources of information:\nApache server (performance and flexibility), Squid caching proxy\n(caching and flexibility), Jigsaw server (Java), wget and cUrl\nclients, as well as related C, C++, and Java libraries that provide\nlower-level interfaces. In many cases, the developers would be happy\nto consult you on specific design issues they have faced so that you\ndo not repeat their mistakes.\n\nI would recommend that you strive for HTTP/1.1 compliance from the\nstart rather than implementing a quick HTTP/1.0 hack in hope to become\ncompliant later. Based on my experience, that \"later\" never happens\nwithout a significant and costly rewrite of primary code. Note that\nnone of the above applications are fully HTTP/1.1 compliant so you\nneed to be careful when adopting best practices.\n\nFinally, make sure that you really need your own stack and cannot\nadopt or wrap an existing library or application :-).\n\nHTH,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP

I bet the code works as they intended.  Webdav\ndoes not know about semantics so, ideally, it needs to generate strong\ntags. However, there is a trade-off between code simplicity and tag\nstrength and it seems like Apache folks resolved this trade-off by\ndeclaring a simple-to-implement tag \"weak\". I do not know whether they\nknew about the requirement you cite; you may want to check source code\nfor insightful comments.\n\nPlease note that HTTP is designed in such a way that the above\nviolation is unlikely to cause problems with compliant implementations\nbecause weak tag comparison is not used for potentially \"dangerous\"\noperations such as merging of ranged responses. In other words, under\nnormal conditions, Apache users will not suffer from the deficiencies\nof the code, provided webdav explicitly marks the tag as weak.\n\nOne can always come up with a corner case, of course. If the Web site\nowner does not think that one second precision is good enough, it\nshould be relatively simple to patch the code to generate strong tags\ninstead (e.g., by appending a sufficiently long and sufficiently\nrandom number to the timestamp). Using MD5 checksums would be even\nbetter, but also more expensive.\n\nThis is my interpretation of the situation. I am neither an RFC editor\nnor Apache developer.\n\nHTH,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3425994"}, {"subject": "SSL in HTTP stac", "content": "Hi,\n     I had a doubt.

The answer\ndepends on what stack interface you want/need to support. You can wrap\neverything under one \"stack\" or provide pluggable SSL wrappers or do\nsomething else, depending on your user needs.\n\n> In that case, for secure HTTP connections, is it OK if we just\n> specify https in the url or should something additional be done.\n\nIt is probably OK provided your stack users do not need any control\nover SSL parameters. There are a lot of SSL knobs:  SSL/TLS protocol\nversions, certification authorities, encryption algorithms, key\nlengths, session caching, etc. Some users need them; some do not care\nas long as everything \"works\".\n\n>      If SSL implemenation is separate, how do we integrate HTTP\n> implementation and SSL implementation?\n\nDepends on how you implemented the HTTP stack and what SSL\nimplementation you are using. For example, OpenSSL library provides at\nleast two major integration options: low-level sockets and high-level\nI/O buffers.\n\nAn important caveat to keep in mind when integrating HTTP and SSL is\nthat SSL may need to read or write data regardless of the current HTTP\n\"direction\" and that SSL may need to do I/Os after HTTP transfer is\ncompleted. For example, SSL may need to read data while your HTTP\nstack is sending a request and, hence, may not expect to read anything\nuntil the request is sent. Your code must ensure there are no\ndeadlocks.\n\nIf you must integrate, read a good book on SSL before you finalize\nmajor HTTP stack design decisions.\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3443112"}, {"subject": "Query Parameters in POST metho", "content": "In case the method in a URL is a POST method,\nthen is that the query parameters are ignored.\n\ne.g:\nPOST /www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF\n\nWill this result in the the query parameters \"hl=en&ie=UTF\" to be ignored as per HTTP standards ??\n\nThanks\nDiwakar\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3452456"}, {"subject": "Connection:KeepAlive and Proxie", "content": "Following is a para which i read in one book.\nI could not understand it.\nCould somebody please elaborate\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAn HTTP/1.0 client could send a \"Keep-Alive\" header to a HTTP/1.1 proxy that did not understand \"Connection\" but might mistakenly forward it.

An exact quote from RFC 2616 (section\n19.6.2) reads:\n\n   The problem was that some existing 1.0 clients may be\n   sending Keep-Alive to a proxy server that doesn't understand\n   Connection, which would then erroneously forward it to the next\n   inbound server, which would establish the Keep-Alive connection and\n   result in a hung HTTP/1.0 proxy waiting for the close on the\n   response.\n\n> My question, is why does it matter. The proxy will just relay\n> whatever comes from actual server to client.\n\nThe problem is not with relaying bytes. That works just fine. The\nproblem is with relaying the \"end of message\" information.  Pure\nHTTP/1.0 applications rely on the [TCP] connection close to detect the\nend of a message. If the connection happens to be persistent, a pure\nHTTP/1.0 client will not detect the end of message for quite a while\n(until the connection is closed, which may happen minutes or even days\nafter the original transaction). Such a delay in end of message\ndetection is bad for at least three reasons:\n\n- various resources are wasted for nothing\n  (it takes some CPU cycles, RAM, TPC ports, and possibly even\n   network bandwidth to keep an idle connection open)\n\n- the end-user software may be indicating that\n  \"download\" is still in progress; the user may be tempted\n  to reload the page because it \"got stuck\", etc.\n\n- HTTP/1.0 clients used by an automated software package\n  (e.g., web crawler or rsync) will block the caller\n  preventing scheduled updates and such from happening\n  [on time]\n\nHTH,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3466456"}, {"subject": "Re: Connection:KeepAlive and Proxie", "content": "Diwakar Shetty <Diwakar.Shetty@oracle.com> writes:\n\n> ---------------------------------------------------\n> \n> An HTTP/1.0 client could send a \"Keep-Alive\" header to a HTTP/1.1\n> proxy that did not understand \"Connection\" but might mistakenly\n> forward it.

Again, there is no such thing\nas HTTP/1.1 proxy that does not understand Connection header because\nConnection: support is a MUST. But the terminology is not important\nhere. I suspect you are more interested in a real-world problem the\nRFC talks about rather than in trying to interpret the book :-).\n\n> It concludes at the end....\"HTTP/1.1 proxies are not permitted to\n> establish a persistent connection with HTTP/1.0 clients\n\nI hope that's not the end! RFC 2616 comes to the same\nconclusion, of course, but then continues:\n\n   The result is that HTTP/1.0 clients must be prevented from\n   using Keep-Alive when talking to proxies.\n\n   However, talking to proxies is the most important use of persistent\n   connections, so that prohibition is clearly unacceptable. Therefore,\n   we need some other mechanism for indicating a persistent connection\n   is desired, which is safe to use even when talking to an old proxy\n   that ignores Connection. Persistent connections are the default for\n   HTTP/1.1 messages; we introduce a new keyword (Connection: close) for\n   declaring non-persistence. See section 14.10.\n\n   The original HTTP/1.0 form of persistent connections (the Connection:\n   Keep-Alive and Keep-Alive header) is documented in RFC 2068. [33]\n\nAs you can see, the problem is solved as long as the client is\nHTTP/1.1.\n\n> > The problem is not with relaying bytes. That works just fine.

You need to draw a picture:\n\nclient C (end-client or proxy)\n(issues Connection: keep-alive)\n       |\n       |\nproxy P\n(forwards Connection: keep-alive,\n does not understand persistency and works as a tunnel)\n       |\n       |\nserver S (origin or proxy)\n(establishes persistent connection: technically with proxy A,\n but, essentially, with client C, which is wrong)\n\nNow, server S will not close the connection after the response is\nsent.  End-client C may be fine because it knows how to detect the end\nof the response. Proxy P will get stuck though because it will wait\nfor connection close from server S.\n\n> It intentionally wants to keep the Connection alive Hence, the\n> client can detect the end of message using \"Content-length\" sent by\n> the origin server, as mentioned by Scott\n\nTrue, but the problem is not with client C. The problem is with proxy\nP. See above. Now imagine that proxy P does not forward small\nresponses until they are \"completely received\"; in this case, client C\ngets stuck as well!\n\nHTH,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3535757"}, {"subject": "Re: Connection:KeepAlive and Proxie", "content": "Alex wrote:\n\n   I think the book is misquoting the RFC.\n\nActually, I think Diwakar Shetty's original message misquoted the book.\n(Alex guess this right.)

They are the same resource. But if the resource is modified multiple\ntimes within a clock interval, the server (Apache) will return the same weak\nentity tag, so user agents may not get the latest modification if they do a\nconditional GET. I'd say that in the case where another client actually did\nsucceed to modifiy the resource twice (in the same clock interval) using\nPUT, this is wrong.\n\n> What the spec is trying to say is that a weak etag cannot be used to\n> test for byte equivalence of the representation, unlike a strong etag.\n> The HTTP components don't need to know why.\n\nOK.

Keep in mind that some proxies are \"transparent\"\nand some are \"reversed\", making a naive client unaware of the proxy\npresence. This makes it difficult, if not impractical, to auto-adjust\nclient behavior depending on the environment.\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3707761"}, {"subject": "Re: contentencoding and range header", "content": "\"Julian Reschke\" <julian.reschke@gmx.de> writes:\n\n> I agree that it depends on the definition of the entity body, which is [1]:\n> \n> entity-body := Content-Encoding( Content-Type( data ) )\n> \n> So I think Stefan's analysis is correct...\n\nBut Accept-Encoding does not _require_ the server to use the specified\nencoding, it _offers_ to accept it.

For example,\n\n  GET /foo HTTP/1.1\n  Host: example.com\n  Accept-Encoding: gzip\n  Range: 0-5000\n\nmay be useful for a client that just needs to peek at the first 5000\nbytes of an unencoded content (at most) and can uncompress the entity\nif needed. The above will save bandwidth for content that compresses\nto fewer than 5000 bytes. Again, this is clearly a rather exotic (but\nHTTP-compliant?) usage.\n\nNote that if the client really needs 10000-19999 unencoded content\nbytes, the request below could be used instead:\n\n  GET /foo HTTP/1.1\n  Host: example.com\n  TE: gzip\n  Range: 10000-19999\n\nSince transfer-coding is applied after the range is selected, the\nclient is guaranteed to receive the same content bytes, and the server\nhas an opportunity to compress the response to save bandwidth.\nTransfer-coding will probably (but not necessarily) cost extra CPU\ncycles.\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-3742892"}, {"subject": "RE: HTTP Partial Download Quer", "content": "I think there is mis-interpretation of information here.\n\nLet me further clarify my points.\nI do not have any control over the Client.

Leave it to the client, the server, and HTTP. Just make sure\nyour code supports any HTTP client you care about. RFC 2616 and other\nspecs define what a client can do; the server API (and CGI specs)\ndefine what your module or CGI needs to do.\n\n> But I can write server side CGI applications.\n> But I want to take care that the DOWNLOAD of the requested\n> DIGITAL CONTENT(mp3,image etc) is complete or not.\n> And also handle the AUTHENTICATION and AUTHORISATION part for\n> the requested DIGITAL CONTENT.\n>\n> AUTHENTICATION and AUTHORISATION part can be handled in Apache\n> Module.\n>\n> But I am still not clear on\n> 1)PARTIAL DOWNLOAD with RANGE request(section 14.35 of RFC 2616)\n\nIs there any reason you want to authenticate or authorize range\nrequests specially? If yes, you need to tell us relevant requirements\nso that we can help. If no, the presence of Range header is irrelevant\nto your authentication and authorization code. You are simply\nauthenticating or authorizing any request that the server asks you to\nhandle.\n\n> 2)Request for multiple non-overlapping ranges(section 19.2 of RFC\n> 2616).\n\nSame as (1). Is there any reason you want to authenticate or authorize\nrange requests specially?\n\n> When the above TWO scenarios are possible?\n\nWhen client sends Range request header and the server honors it. Both\nevents are probably irrelevant to authentication and authorization\ncode. In general, authentication and authorization would depend on\nother request headers.\n\n> How can one know that the DOWNLOAD is complete in above two cases?\n\nThis has nothing to do with authentication and authorization, right?\nYou need to define \"complete download\" first. If by \"complete\ndownload\" you mean that an entire entity was _sent_ to the client,\nthen you have at least three cases to take care of:\n\n1) The server is generating a \"200 OK\" response,\n  sending entire entity to an authenticated and\n  authorized client. In this case, you can check\n  that the entire response left the server (no\n  aborted connections and such).\n\n2) The server is generating a \"206 Partial Content\"\n  response, sending one or more pieces of an entity\n  to an authenticated and authorized client. To check\n  whether the entire entity was sent, you would probably\n  have to establish and track some kind of a \"session\"\n  with the client (a download state that pure HTTP lacks).\n\n  Alternatively, you can assume that no client will do\n  two partial downloads for the same content in parallel.\n  Then you can use authentication information as session\n  identifier. This assumption will not hold in all real-world\n  environments, of course.\n\n  Note that it is probably  impossible to guarantee that a\n  client cannot fool your \"session\" tracking code simply\n  because you cannot distinguish one client session from\n  another client session originating from the same client\n  (without client-side support which you said you lack).\n\n  Once you assigned a session ID to a sequence of responses,\n  you can maintain a response \"coverage map\", marking pieces\n  that were sent to the client.

Leave it to the client, the server, and HTTP. Just make sure\nyour code supports any HTTP client you care about. RFC 2616 and other\nspecs define what a client can do; the server API (and CGI specs)\ndefine what your module or CGI needs to do.\n\n> But I can write server side CGI applications.\n> But I want to take care that the DOWNLOAD of the requested\n> DIGITAL CONTENT(mp3,image etc) is complete or not.\n> And also handle the AUTHENTICATION and AUTHORISATION part for\n> the requested DIGITAL CONTENT.\n>\n> AUTHENTICATION and AUTHORISATION part can be handled in Apache\n> Module.\n>\n> But I am still not clear on\n> 1)PARTIAL DOWNLOAD with RANGE request(section 14.35 of RFC 2616)\n\nIs there any reason you want to authenticate or authorize range\nrequests specially?

You are simply\nauthenticating or authorizing any request that the server asks you to\nhandle.\n\n> 2)Request for multiple non-overlapping ranges(section 19.2 of RFC\n> 2616).\n\nSame as (1). Is there any reason you want to authenticate or authorize\nrange requests specially?\n\n> When the above TWO scenarios are possible?\n\nWhen client sends Range request header and the server honors it. Both\nevents are probably irrelevant to authentication and authorization\ncode. In general, authentication and authorization would depend on\nother request headers.\n\n> How can one know that the DOWNLOAD is complete in above two cases?\n\nThis has nothing to do with authentication and authorization, right?\nYou need to define \"complete download\" first. If by \"complete\ndownload\" you mean that an entire entity was _sent_ to the client,\nthen you have at least three cases to take care of:\n\n1) The server is generating a \"200 OK\" response,\n  sending entire entity to an authenticated and\n  authorized client. In this case, you can check\n  that the entire response left the server (no\n  aborted connections and such).\n\n2) The server is generating a \"206 Partial Content\"\n  response, sending one or more pieces of an entity\n  to an authenticated and authorized client. To check\n  whether the entire entity was sent, you would probably\n  have to establish and track some kind of a \"session\"\n  with the client (a download state that pure HTTP lacks).\n\n  Alternatively, you can assume that no client will do\n  two partial downloads for the same content in parallel.\n  Then you can use authentication information as session\n  identifier. This assumption will not hold in all real-world\n  environments, of course.\n\n  Note that it is probably  impossible to guarantee that a\n  client cannot fool your \"session\" tracking code simply\n  because you cannot distinguish one client session from\n  another client session originating from the same client\n  (without client-side support which you said you lack).\n\n  Once you assigned a session ID to a sequence of responses,\n  you can maintain a response \"coverage map\", marking pieces\n  that were sent to the client. Once there are no holes\n  in the map, the download is complete.\n\n3) The server is not sending any content to a client.\n   It could be a response to HEAD request or perhaps a 100\n   Continue message. Your code should skip such responses.\n\nIf by \"complete download\" you mean that an entire entity was\n_received_ by the client, then you cannot track that reliably without\nclient-side support.\n\nPerhaps your requirements are such that your authorization code must\nknow how much content the client has received so far (e.g., some kind\nof pay-per-play scheme).

However, not all remote computers have a (single,\nunique, static) IP address. Some remote computers have no IP address.\nNot all browsers will let you access client IP address.

It might \nalso be an idea to specify the same for other text attributes as well.\n\nAs mentioned above BCP 18 indicates UTF-8 is the preferred charset for \nprotocols.\n\nAdditionally, I believe it would be very difficult to create a foolproof \nguessing method that would decide the charset based on such things as the \ncharset of the authentication challenge response body, toplevel domain of \nthe server, or the same from the referrer (if any), or the character set \nused on the client's computer (which may not match what is used on the \nserver). As an example, the challenge may use a default message in English, \nwhile passwords and documents are encoded in a Japanese character set.\n\nI think the best way of avoiding (any further) ambiguities is to specify a \nsingle character set that MUST be used, and UTF-8 is the character set \nrecommended by BCP 18.\n\n\n-- \nSincerely,\nYngve N.

Can't the server just use them as is?\n\nI'm afraid not.\n\nRemember, the server must not just be able to perform calculations using \nthe password, it must also be able to look up the appropriate username \nentry in its database. If the client and the server are using different \ncharacter sets in any phase of creating, updating and referencing this \ndatabase there will be no match.\n\nHowever, I've just noticed that RFC 2616 actually do comment on this in \nsection 2.2, and requires RFC 2047 encoding for any TEXT not using iso- \n8859-1 encoding.\n\nThe question then becomes: Should the errata of RFC 2617 override that \nrequirement and mandate UTF-8, or should an extension to the current header \nmethods be formulated, or should completely new authentication methods be \nformulated that will handle UTF-8 usernames/passwords?\n\nOne way of overriding that section would be to change the defintions of \nusernames and passwords to using OCTET (minus control characters and \nspecial characters) instead of TEXT. Something similar was proposed in the \nthread referenced by Larry Masinter.\n\nPersonally I'd prefer to override RFC 2616 sec 2.2 for RFC 2617 \ncredentials, as I think BCP 18 should be the guideline. If that is not \npossible I'd like to avoid RFC 2047 syntax (E.g: Which charset should be \nused for the password in digest authentication, and how do we tell the \nserver?).\n\nI can think of several alternatives if UTF-8 cannot be made mandatory:\n\nAlternative 1: Specify that if all characters in both the username and \npassword is in the iso-8859-1 charset, then iso-8859-1 can be used, in all \nother cases utf-8 is used. This will probably lead to some \nusername/password collisions; I do not know how serious this will be.\n\nAlternative 2: Extend RFC 2617 with two new methods (e.g.) \"Basic8\" and \n\"Digest8\", with mostly the same syntax as the present \"Basic\" and \"Digest\" \nmethods, but with the requirement that username and password is encoded in \nUTF-8. However, this will require the server to send one extra header for \neach method it supports, and would probably need to be specified separately \nas an RFC.\n\nAlternative 3: Extend the syntax of \"Basic\" and \"Digest\" authentication \nheaders with a \"utf-8\" parameter which, when included in the server's \nchallenge, indicate that the server understands UTF-8 encoded usernames and \npasswords. When a UTF-8 enable client sees this parameter it can then \nencode the username and password in UTF-8 and add a utf-8 parameter to the \nauthorization header it sends to the server to indicate that the \nauthorization is in UTF-8.\n\nExamples:\n\n  WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"realm\", utf-8\n  WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm=\"realm\", <digest parameters>, utf-8\n\n  Authorization: Basic <basic-credentials>, utf-8\n  Authorization: Digest <digest-response>, utf-8\n\nBy using a utf-8 parameter instead of a charset parameter, it's possible to \nlimit the charset permutatitons the client and the server have to be able \nto handle.\n\nHowever, given that the A1 value for Digest authentication may be \ncalculated in advance and by a thirdparty server, that means that two A1 \nvalues must be prepared, and distributed, when non-US-ASCII \nusernames/passwords are used (Come to think of it, this will also be the \ncase if utf-8 is mandated, at least in a transition phase).\n\nPersonally, as mentioned, I prefer making utf-8 mandatory, but if \nalternative specifications are needed I think alternatives 1 and 3 are the \nmost acceptable of the alternatives above.\n\n-- \nSincerely,\nYngve N.

It lacks (polished versions of) the following two rules:\n- any quoted string MUST be interpreted only after the\n  quotes are removed\n- any token MAY be quoted\n\nThese rules would make quoted things equivalent to unquoted things (as\nlong as the latter can be correctly parsed) and eliminate some of the\nconfusion. In other words, it would say \"when in doubt, quote\". I\nsuspect this is what the authors implied, but there are no explicit\nrules like that, unfortunately. RFC 2616 comes close when it says that\n\"A string of text is parsed as a single word if it is quoted\", but\nthat phrase is not precise enough and does lead to different\nimplementations.\n\nThe problem you discuss is not limited to authentication\nheaders. There are, for example, proxies that quote cache-control\ndirectives confusing many HTTP agents:\nCache-Control: \"private\"\nversus canonical\nCache-Control: private\n\n\nIn general, if there is a more specific BNF that [re]defines a\ngeneric parameter from RFC 2616, that more specific BNF should be\nfollowed. Hopefully, there are no conflicts (requiring a specific part\nof an OR statement is not a conflict!) other than those caused by the\nlack of the above quotation rules.\n\nThe following RFC 2616 wording may answer your second\nquestion:\n\n   Many HTTP/1.1 header field values consist of words separated by LWS\n   or special characters. These special characters MUST be in a quoted\n   string to be used within a parameter value\n\nA comma (',') is a special character in a digest-response context and,\nhence, digest-uri-value must be quoted if it contains commas. This may\nstill cause interoperability problems, of course. Many implementations\nwe work with do not handle quoted strings well enough.\n\n\nTo summarize, here are two compatibility rules of thumb I try to\nfollow/recommend:\n- if the spec allows you not to quote something,\n  do not quote that something unless quotes are necessary for\n  correct parsing on the other end\n- accept quoted something even if quotes are not necessary;\n  remove quotes before interpreting that something\n\nHTH,\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\nOn Mon, 21 Apr 2003, Jim Luther wrote:\n\n>\n> rfc2617 defines auth-param as:\n>\n>        auth-param= token \"=\" ( token | quoted-string )\n>\n> and defines challenge and credentials as:\n>\n> challenge= auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param\n> credentials= auth-scheme #auth-param\n>\n> However, other parts of rfc2617 don't make a couple of things clear:\n>\n> 1 - Can quoted-strings be used where they are not required for the\n> value of an auth-param and the BNF for the value of the auth-param\n> doesn't mention quoting?\n>\n> An example of this is the nonce-count auth-param in the digest-response\n> (section 3.2.2).

The server HTTP stack is indeed\nlikely to see no \"extra\" requests after the TCP connection is closed\n(which usually happens right after the final server response is sent).\nHowever, asynchronous I/Os, half-closed TCP connections, SSL/TLS\nwrappers, and other real-world complications make the situation less\npredictable.\n\nAs for re-sending pipelined requests, we already have a MUST for that:\n\n   Clients MUST also be prepared to resend their requests if\n   the server closes the connection before sending all of the\n   corresponding responses.\n\nAlex.\n\n-- \n                            | HTTP performance - Web Polygraph benchmark\nwww.measurement-factory.com | HTTP compliance+ - Co-Advisor test suite\n                            | all of the above - PolyBox appliance\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-4212211"}, {"subject": "polling re: Upgrade and CONNECT suppor", "content": "I'm attempting to determine what features of HTTP specified by RFC\n2817 (Upgrade header and CONNECT method support) have been implemented\nand tested with other implementations in order to discover whether or\nnot the spec can be advanced to Draft Standard status.\n\nThe RFC discusses these features in the context of upgrading to HTTP\nover TLS, because doing so was needed by IPP, so I expect that some\nfeatures will have been done primarily in the HTTP used by IPP clients\nand servers. \n\nHowever, the protocol features it describes are actually generic to\nany use of Upgrade and CONNECT.

In this manner, one can keep abreast \nof news headlines and other chronologically-ordered lists.\n\nThis format is becoming more popular, both because of increasing \nsupport (sites like MSDN, the New York Times and CNN all have RSS \nfeeds) and the arrival of \"weblogs\" (which also uses RSS).\n\nThere are a number of interesting questions about RSS that come to \nmind, including;\n   - what is the polling interval?\n   - how common is validation?\n   - what is the rate of change for the RSS?\n   - what is the size of the feed?\n   - what times of day does polling happen?\n   - how self-similar is RSS traffic (is is \"lumpy\" around the top of \nthe hour, for example?)\n\nI suspect that RSS, because it is polled, is not at all typical Web \ntraffic, and therefore places unusual requirements on Web servers and \nintermediaries. I also suspect that it may eventually require us to \nrethink distribution; invalidation and other approaches may become much \nmore desirable, as opposed to polling.\n\nRather than keep all of the fun for myself (I have a day job), I've \nplaced the traces on the Web for the greater enjoyment of the caching \nand traffic characterization community ;)  They are at:\n   http://www.mnot.net/rss/traces/\n(this will redirect to another site; please bookmark the URI above, in \ncase it changes).\n\nSo far, I have one trace; it has been anonymized (combined log format \nwith the client IP, ident, userinfo, URI, referer and user-agent fields \nhashed or half-hashed). If there is another format that's more \nsuitable, please tell me.\n\nThis trace contains about 500,000 entries and represents a week's worth \nof access to a RSS \"scraping\" service; i.e., it's a Web site that \nprocesses other Web sites to produce a number of feeds. As such, it \ncontains accesses to multiple feeds.\n\nPlease tell me if this is interesting/useful, and send along any \nresults you come up with. I'm working on getting more traces; stay \ntuned (are any of the repositories - e.g., W3C WCA, Internet Traffic \nArchive - still active?

For every TCP connection it accepts, the tunnel\nshould establish a TCP connection to the origin server and shovel\noctets until either side terminates the connection.

I doubt there are\nHTTP/1.1 compliant servers out there (because there is no test for\norigin server compliance yet), but something like Apache should work\nwell enough.\n\n> My question is, if there din't exist a proxy between the browser and\n> the server, won't the browser and the server handle all these\n> differences ?\n\nYes, they would.\n\n> In which case, how should a proxy now make a difference?\n\nNobody said an HTTP proxy would make a difference in your case! The\nreason to have a proxy is to add some new functionality (e.g., request\naggregation or caching or virus checking). In your case, the only\nfunctionality that an origin server cannot support is (I am guessing)\na public IP address. If the origin server address is public, you do\nnot need a tunnel.\n\n> Can't I just forward the request or just tunnel it as if it were\n> HTTPS, and be assured that it works?\n\nYou can tunnel as if it were TCP.

A quick look at our test results shows that our of 6 HTTP\nproxies, 5 violate at least one Expect-related test case, and some\nviolate most of them.

In my experience,\n  the popularity of WebDAV will force the majority\n  of implementations to become compliant (in\n  relevant areas) relatively soon after WebDAV users\n  start to bombard server/proxy support teams with bug\n  reports.

Alternatively, you can invent an\n  XOPTIONS/XEXPECT pair with end-to-end semantics and\n  sent XOPTIONS request before uploading 100MB object.\n  All this introduces extra bytes on the wire.\n  This also complicates your specs and implementations,\n  but it makes immediate deployment more smooth.\n\nSome people will call option (a) the \"Right Thing To Do\".

For those who\nhave not, here is the gist:\n\nModern browsers usually do not allow scripts embedded in\nHTML to access cookies and authentication information\nexchanged between HTTP client and server. However, a\nscript can get access to that info by sending a\nsimple HTTP TRACE request to the originating (innocent)\nserver. The user agent will auto-include current\nauthentication info in such request. The server will echo all\nthe authentication information back, for script to read and\n[mis]use. Apparently, sending an HTTP request is possible via\nmany scripting methods like ActiveX. See the URL above for\ndetails.\n\nWith numerous XSS (cross-site-scripting) vulnerabilities in user\nagents, this seems like a real and nasty problem. TRACE method support\nis optional per RFC 2616, but many popular servers support it. White\nHat Security advises server administrators to disable support for\nTRACE.\n\nWhat is your opinion?

The headers work with some servers under certain \ncircumstances and not at all with others. Consider this header:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nGET http://www.yahoo.com/index.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.yahoo.com\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-us\nConnection: keep-alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis request to Yahoo works fine when each newline is '\\n' but not when \nthe newlines are '\\n\\r', this is exactly the reverse of what I would \nexpect. By the way '\\n\\r' is: 0A 0D. When '\\n\\r' is used there is no \nresponse at all from the server.\n\nSomething similar happens with www.reuters.co.uk.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nGET http://www.reuters.co.uk/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.reuters.co.uk\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-us\nConnection: keep-alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I use '\\n\\r' I get: 'HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request' but with just '\\n' I \nget: 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK'. (Obviously these were followed by the rest of \nthe header and the body as well in the case of the latter.\n\nExactly the same responses as reuters gave are given by \nwww.yourdictionary.com - the same header was sent except for the server \naddress.\n\nHowever www.google.com does not respond to the following header at all \nregardless of whether '\\n\\r' or '\\n' is used. That's a no response not a \n'HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request' response.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nGET http://www.google.com/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.google.com\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-us\nConnection: keep-alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks and regards from a very confused newcomer to HTTP programming,\n\n..matthew\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-4927092"}, {"subject": "Suggest a site with chunked encodin", "content": "I am interested to see the flow of a chunked response comes from a Origin\nserver can any one suggest a site which does chunked encoding\n\nIs it possible to get a connection :close header with chunked reponse.If\nsuch a thing happens what should/will be the behavior of the client/proxy\n\nNote: I will just send one request .I will not be doing any stress testing\n\n\nThanks & Regards\nVijay\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-4937514"}, {"subject": "Re: Suggest a site with chunked encodin", "content": "[Vijayabhaskar_Mamidi: Mar 07 11:39]\n> \n> I am interested to see the flow of a chunked response comes from a Origin\n> server can any one suggest a site which does chunked encoding\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/\n\n> \n> Is it possible to get a connection :close header with chunked reponse.If\n> such a thing happens what should/will be the behavior of the client/proxy\n\nsure it's possilble.

You can install a header-stripping proxy in front of\nyour server, but that is probably not what you are after. If your\nhttpd cannot handle partial reads, you should fix it.\n\nAlso, please note that the browser is not the only agent that can add\nHTTP headers to requests.

In particular,\nit says that an authentication session lasts until the\nclient receives another WWW-Authenticate header.\n\nPresumably, the session ends at this point because\nthe nonce has changed. Using this logic, the authentication\nsession should also terminate if the client receives a\nresponse with an Authentication-Info header containing a\nnextnonce parameter.\n\nTermination of a session with nextnonce isn't mentioned\nanywhere, though -- so it's not clear whether this was\nthe intention when the RFC was written. In particular, it's\nnot clear to me what value changing a nonce within the\nsame session would provide.\n\nTo be specific, when using MD5-sess, the proper client\nbehavior upon receiving nextnonce is not particularly clear.\nTo illustrate the ambiguity, I'll demonstrate the exact\nissue with a use case.\n\n1) Client sends a request.\n\n2) Server challenges request, with an algorithm of \"MD5-Sess\".\n   We will call the nonce sent in this challenge \"nonce-value-1\".\n\n3) Client re-sends request, with response to challenge. This response\n   includes a cnonce, which we will call \"cnonce-value-1\". The\n   response is calculated as follows:\n\n   KD(H(unq(username-value) \":\" unq(realm-value) \":\" passwd)\n      \":\" unq(nonce-value-1) \":\" unq(cnonce-value-1),\n      unq(nonce-value-1) \":\" nc-value \":\" unq(cnonce-value-1) \":\"\n      unq(qop-value) \":\" Method \":\" digest-uri-value)\n\n4) Server responds to request with a 200 response. This response\n   contains a new nonce in a nextnonce parameter. We will call\n   this value \"nonce-value-2\".\n\n5) Later, the client sends a second request. It preemptively includes\n   an \"Authentication\" header with a cnonce that we will call\n   \"cnonce-value-2\".\n\nHere's where the confusion lies. For the highest chance of success,\nshould the client calculate the response-digest as:\n\nA) KD(H(unq(username-value) \":\" unq(realm-value) \":\" passwd)\n      \":\" unq(nonce-value-1) \":\" unq(cnonce-value-1),\n      unq(nonce-value-2) \":\" nc-value \":\" unq(cnonce-value-2) \":\"\n      unq(qop-value) \":\" Method \":\" digest-uri-value)\n\nor as:\n\nB) KD(H(unq(username-value) \":\" unq(realm-value) \":\" passwd)\n      \":\" unq(nonce-value-2) \":\" unq(cnonce-value-2),\n      unq(nonce-value-2) \":\" nc-value \":\" unq(cnonce-value-2) \":\"\n      unq(qop-value) \":\" Method \":\" digest-uri-value)\n\nThe text in the document would support A (since only WWW-Authenticate\nends an authentication session and H(A1) \"is calculated only once\" per\nauthentication session), while B seems far more intuitive.\n\nSo, what have people here actually implemented?\n\n/a\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-5274302"}, {"subject": "BNF inconsistency in Language tag in RFC261", "content": "In the process of preparing a draft of the spec for full standard,\n(yes,  Petunia, we should get this puppy to full standard someday,\nhopefully soon) and checking updated references,\nI uncovered the following inconsistency:\n\nRFC 1766, which is referenced by RFC 2616 section 3.10 as the source\nfor its definition of language tags has a BNF has been updated\nby RFC3066 (a BCP).\n\nRFC 3066 defines these as:\n\n    Language-Tag = Primary-subtag *( \"-\" Subtag )\n    Primary-subtag = 1*8ALPHA\n    Subtag = 1*8(ALPHA / DIGIT)\n\nHTTP/1.1 RFC 2616 defines these as:\n        language-tag  = primary-tag *( \"-\" subtag )\n        primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA\n        subtag        = 1*8ALPHA\n\nIs there any danger in relaxing the HTTP BNF to remove the\ninconsistency (the hob-goblin of small minds :-))?\n                               - Jim\n\n-- \nJim Gettys <Jim.Gettys@hp.com>\nHP Labs, Cambridge Research Laboratory\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-5284411"}, {"subject": "Re: BNF inconsistency in Language tag in RFC261", "content": "Jim Gettys <Jim.Gettys@hp.com> writes:\n\n>     Language-Tag = Primary-subtag *( \"-\" Subtag )\n>     Primary-subtag = 1*8ALPHA\n>     Subtag = 1*8(ALPHA / DIGIT)\n>\n> HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616 defines these as:\n>         language-tag  = primary-tag *( \"-\" subtag )\n>         primary-tag   = 1*8ALPHA\n>         subtag        = 1*8ALPHA\n>\n> Is there any danger in relaxing the HTTP BNF to remove the\n> inconsistency (the hob-goblin of small minds :-))?\n\nI think that would be safe - I doubt anyone is depending on there not\nbeing digits in there, and even if they are, the fallback rules should\nmake them match on the less-specific primary tag.\n\n-- \nScott Lawrence        \n  http://skrb.org/scott/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-5293501"}, {"subject": "compliant proxies found, at las", "content": "I would like to share a piece of good news with folks who care about\nHTTP: Two HTTP proxies, an open-source RabbIT[1] and a commercial\nimplementation from Datapower[2], have recently managed to pass all\napplicable RFC 2616 MUSTs that we could test.

Now down/masq Apache will make an HTTP \nrequest to upstream mail.yahoo.com. It would not make sense for the \ndown/masq Apache httpd on yahoo.example.com to pass along the Host \nheader with the initial value (\"yahoo.example.com\") to upstream \nmail.yahoo.com, as the upstream server likely only accepts requests \nwithin the yahoo.com domain. Request a URI within \"yahoo.example.com\", \nand mail.yahoo.com is likely to give an error message (or, depending on \nthe HTTP server software it uses, it might return HTML for a different \nsite on the same IP address, e.g. content from \"my.yahoo.com\"). \nmail.yahoo.com is likely to only give reliably correct documents when it \nsees a Host header whose value it recognizes as one it's responsible for.\n\nAs for the X- headers, I'd *guess* that it is expected that the upstream \nserver and downstream server will have some sort of relationship, and \nApache is passing along the original client information in X- headers so \nthat the info is available to the upstream server. Since Apache httpd's \nProxyPass is a *masquerading* setup and not an implementation of a \nHTTP-compliant proxy server, X- headers were the only way for Apache to \npass that info to the upstream server.\n\nIf that doesn't make sense (and it well might not; I'm not an Apache \nproxypass developer), I think you might want to follow up with an \nappropriate Apache mailing list.\n\n> At 22:58 -0700 10/12/03, Mark Nottingham wrote:\n> \n>>They're X- headers; unofficial, albeit oft-used by reverse proxies (aka surrogates, gateways, etc.).

OK, maybe not RFC 1149. But if there's a \nbusiness relationship between the downstream and upstream server, \nthey'll work something out.\n\nIf there's not a business relationship, then the downstream server \nshould issue an HTTP redirect to the client and be done with it.\n\nStandards like HTTP exist to provide interoperability to disparate, \nunrelated systems on broad, often public, networks. That's generally not \nthe case between downstream/upstream servers in an HTTP masquerading setup.\n\nWell, that's my opinion. I'll back off and let you make your case to \nothers. What I'd suggest: 1) suggest a \"solution\" 2) give more \nillustrations of the \"problem\" that don't involve Apache's ProxyPass \nimplementation. I honestly can't tell if you have a general complaint \n(and, if so, how a public standard would address what I imagine your \ndesire to be without facilitating something like content \ntheft/misrepresentation) or a problem with Apache's software (maybe \nyou're trying to do something that would be better served with other \nproducts [Squid?

Proxy-authenticate is a hop-by-hop header.  Proxy1 can \nauthenticate itself to proxy2, but the browser cannot (according to the \nstandard) authenticate *itself* to proxy2, only to proxy1.

The problem occurs because proxy1 is reusing\nconnections to proxy2 for requests from different users, but proxy2 is only\nauthenticating the first request on each new connection.  This means that\nsubsequent requests are not being authenticated, and these requests are\nbeing treated as if they originated from the first user to use the\nconnection.  \n\nWhich proxy is at fault?  I understood that one of the intended\nbenefits of persistent connections was that a proxy would only have to\nauthenticate the first request on each connection, which is a huge\nperformance benefit.  But ths assumes that a downstream proxy that passes\nthrough user authentication will not re-use the connection for different\nusers.  Having said that, so far I have been unable to find any\nspecification that says a proxy need only authenticate the first request on\neach connection.\n\nI'd appreciate any thoughts on the matter, \n\n\nRob Maidment. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------\nClearswift monitors, controls and protects all its messaging traffic in \ncompliance with its corporate email policy using Clearswift products. \nFind out more about Clearswift, its solutions and services at \nwww.clearswift.com.\n****************************************************************************\n*******\nThis communication is confidential and may contain privileged \ninformation intended solely for the named addressee(s).

Firstly, rfc 2616 14.34\nallows squids behaviour in forwarding the authentication details.\n\nThe ntlm/kerberos tcp session based authentication used by MS proxies\n(and squid has an option in 2.5 and above) isn't compatible with the\nbase HTTP spec. However there is an expired I-D (one url for it is \nhttp://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:Fcb67r9QFF4J:www.globecom.net/ietf/draft/draft-brezak-spnego-http-03.html+SPNEGO+http+draft&hl=en&ie=UTF-8)\nthe draft was brezak-spnego-http.\n\nThat draft described a new header \"Proxy-support:\nSession-Based-Authentication\" for proxies to use to indicate to clients\nthat they support the connection semantics needed to operate correctly\nwith such upstream servers (proxies where not documented, but we've\nfound MSIE uses the same mechanism with proxies as servers, insofar as\nthe authentication is concerned - we haven't tested the proxy-support\nheader.\n\nSquid doesn't issue the Proxy-support header, and if (as it should be)\nit's listed in the connection header by the upstream proxy, then squid\nwould strip it. However, as we don't support the connection semantics to\nuse NTLM or kerberos through squid, in recent squid 2.5 releases we\nfilter the incompatible authentication headers.\n\nSo, I'd suggest that the user has an older squid release, as a newer\nrelease wouldn't show these symptoms.\n\nRob\n\n-- \nGPG key available at: <http://members.aardvark.net.au/lifeless/keys.txt>.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-5580905"}, {"subject": "RE: Chained proxies, persistent connections, authenticatio", "content": "Thankyou for all the contributions on this thread.  \n\nI over-simplified the proxy1 (Squid) role in the scenario slightly for the\nsake of clarity, so I'll explain exactly what is going on:  Squid is\nauthenticating the users, using the Basic authentication scheme I assume.\nIt then consollidates these users into 5 roles-based groups.

Duanes suggestion of disabling\nserver persistent connections is an effective workaround. proxy2\nhowever, should be fixed. The MS NTLM/Kerberos/Negotiate connection\nbased authentication do connection based auth, but AFAIK MS's basic\nimplementation does check per request.

The test suite checks for order preservation\nunder two basic scenarios:\n\n* a proxy MUST NOT change the order of multiple header\n  field-values with one field-name (8 test cases)\n\n* a proxy MUST NOT change the order of cached multiple header\n  field-values with one field-name (4 test cases)\n\nThe first test clause contains test cases for both requests and\nresponses. There are implementations that violate some of the above\ntest cases, IIRC.\n\n\nNote that HTTP does have a [theoretical] problem in this area. From\nRFC 2616 point of view, extension headers are not #value headers.\nHowever, in the specification that defines a given extension header\n(RFC X), the header may be declared using a #value construct. This\nmeans that X-aware intermediaries might split the header while\nX-unaware intermediaries might reorder or drop some of the splitted\nvalues. This probably means that HTTP extensions must not declare\n#value headers, but they do.\n\nThe reason for this [theoretical] problem is that HTTP relies on\nheader definition in some spec to determine header syntax (e.g., \"is\nit a list?\")  instead of having a fixed set of syntax constructs that\ncan be recognized without knowing the header semantics.

Using OPTIONS, one can only test whether the agent claims to\nbe compliant (i.e., uses version HTTP/1.1 in response).

The only disagreement that we have (had?) is whether \nclients can rely on \"OPTIONS *\" returning something meaningful. I think \nit has been shown that they can't, thus RFC2518bis shouldn't add any new \nlanguage suggesting that. In addition, we have no evidence of clients \nthat actually use that.\n\nRegarding Lisa's draft for a PATCH method, I still believe that getting \nrid of any dependencies on OPTIONS will make it easier to be \nacccepted/implemented. At the very least it shouldn't require \"OPTIONS \n*\" to do anything it won't actually do in practice.\n\n> ...\n> \n> Adding some extension header to OPTIONS, to signal new well-defined\n> functionality would be a similar approach that does not require an\n> extension method.\n\nThat's what WebDAV already does \n(<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2518.html#HEADER_DAV>), and \nbesides the problem with \"OPTIONS *\", there doesn't seem to be any \nreal-world problem with it.\n\nJulian\n\n-- \n<green/>bytes GmbH -- http://www.greenbytes.de -- tel:+492512807760\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-5934299"}, {"subject": "Re: OPTIONS ", "content": "Scott Lawrence wrote:\n\n > ...\n> I agree that the best that can be done now is to document what can and\n> cannot be achieved with what we have (pretty limited, but it does make\n> a good no-op message; we used it that way in RFC 2817).\n\nAgreed.

I \npreviuously raised it in April 2003.\n\nBackground:\n\nRFC 2617 does not mention which character set should be used when \ngenerating the authentication credentials. This has led to a situation \nwhere (at the very least) various clients have made different design \nchoices, which have resulted in some interoperability problems.\n\nWhen I implemented Unicode support for authentication in Opera I chose \nUTF-8 as the encoding for the credential inputdata, based, among other \nreasons, on the recommendations of BCP 18/RFC 2277. We have received a \ncouple of reports about problems caused by this.\n\n\nNew information:\n\nLimited testing indicates that MSIE uses the character set selected in the \nView->Encoding menu when encoding Basic Authentication credentials. As the \nintention was only to get an idea about what kind of character sets where \nused, Mozilla/Netscape and other clients were not tested.\n\nIf correct, this means that MSIE users can authenticate correctly as long \nas the server is using the same character set as they do, but as soon as \nthe server is using a different character set they have to manually change \nthe Encoding before being able to continue. And AFAIK, (disclaimer: I am \nnot a character set expert) many of the Asian, Eastern European and Middle \nEast nationalities have more than one character set to choose from, which \nmeans that even within a single nation you could run into problems.\n\n\n\nOther items:\n\n From Paul Leach (my summary+extra info)\n--------\nBasic Authentication's username and password attributes are defined as \n\"*TEXT\", Digest Authentication's username parameter is an qouted string \n(essentially *TEXT) and passwd has no real definition, but probably *TEXT \nor *OCTET.\n\nRFC 2616 does say that if a *TEXT word contains non-iso-8859-1 characters \nthey should be represented using the RFC 2047 rules (e.g \n=?charset?Q?text?= ).\n--------\n\nI have, however, never seen the RFC 2047 QP syntax used by a HTTP client \nor server, and we could encounter problems regarding the Digest processing \nof passwords (Which charset is used? The same as in the username? Which \nencoding? Q or B? And what about precalculated A1 values?)\n\n From Alexey Melnikov (my summary)\n--------\nRFC 2831 (Digest as SASL) introduced a charset attribute and complex rules \nto handle the situation.\n--------\n\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nShortrange: At the very least I think that the updated RFC 2617 draft \nshould address the issue.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer a permanent solution (one character set, or a \nnegotiation method), but given the current implementation of clients and \nservers I suspect we may have to make do with something that effectively \nsays \"The client and server must be configured to use the same character \nset. How the configured character set is agreed upon is not defined by \nthis specification\".\n\n\nLongrange: A permanent solution (beside leaving the sitation as it is) can \ntake several forms:\n\n1) Updating the current methods by doing either of these:\n\n   A) Define a standard character set to be used.\n\n   B) Define a negotiation method, either client only, or client select \n from server's list. E.g. The client adds a charset attribute in the \nchallenge response.\n\nProblem: How to solve backwards compatibility?\n\n2) Define new internationalized authentication methods, at least for \ndigest.\n\nAll of these will require that both servers and clients are updated with \nnew functionality, which will cause transition problems.\n\n\n\nPersonally, of course, I'd prefer that UTF-8 is endorsed as the character \nset.\n\n-- \nSincerely,\nYngve N.

The encoding of the passwd value was not specified by\n   [RFC 2616], so for backward compatibility, servers MAY also\n   calculate the A1 value using any convention used prior to this\n   specification.\n\n  So that section would read:\n\n3.2.2.2 A1\n\n   If the \"algorithm\" directive's value is \"MD5\" or is unspecified, then\n   A1 is:\n\n      A1       = unq(username-value) \":\" unq(realm-value) \":\" passwd\n\n   where\n\n      passwd   = < user's password >\n\n   The passwd value SHOULD be encoded using UTF-8 [ref] for input to\n   the hash.

It uses the\n   server nonce from that challenge, and the first client nonce value to\n   construct A1 as follows:\n\n      A1       = H( unq(username-value) \":\" unq(realm-value)\n                     \":\" passwd )\n                     \":\" unq(nonce-value) \":\" unq(cnonce-value)\n\n   This creates a 'session key' for the authentication of subsequent\n   requests and responses which is different for each \"authentication\n   session\", thus limiting the amount of material hashed with any one\n   key.  (Note: see further discussion of the authentication session in\n   section 3.3.) Because the server need only use the hash of the user\n   credentials in order to create the A1 value, this construction could\n   be used in conjunction with a third party authentication service so\n   that the web server would not need the actual password value.

And AFAICT that is \nthe present situation.\n\n> I think that the character set isn't important - only the encoding;\n> they both already (presumably) share the secret, they just have to\n> agree on a common representation of it.\n\nThe server and client must *also* agree about the binary representation \n(character set and encoding) of the username, as the username is used as \nan index into the password database.\n\nAbout Basic authentication: If RFC 2047 encoding is to be used preparing \nthe username and password attributes (if they are not using the iso-8859-1 \ncharacter set) before creating the \"basic-credentials\" attribute, I think  \nRFC 2617 should require it, even if it is supposed to follow from the \ndefintion of *TEXT in sec. 2.2 of RFC 2616. Using RFC 2047 encoding does \nrequire that the server is able to map the characters to its own local \nrepresentation, and require more processing of the credentials.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, my position is that I'd rather require UTF-8 \ncharacter set and encoding of the input (username and password) to the \ncredential generation.\n\n-- \nSincerely,\nYngve N.

This means that the username and password are represented \nto the server using EBCDIC character codes, not US-ASCII.\n\nWhen the client is creating the credentials it will be using US-ASCII as \nthe character set, instead of EBCDIC.\n\nThe binary representation (in C-style hex) of \"foo\" in US-ASCII is <0x66 \n0x6F 0x6F>, while it is <0x86 0x96 0x96> in EBCDIC.\n\nUnless the server explicitly converts the recieved username from US-ASCII \nto EBCDIC (or the other way for the EBCDIC version) before using it, the \nserver will not be able to get a match, despite the fact that the user \nentered \"foo\" when registering and when autenticating.\n\nThat was phase 1; now for phase 2: Replace \"US-ASCII\" with one of the \nJapanese character sets e.g. Shift-JIS, \"EBCDIC\" with one of the other \njapanese character sets, e.g. EUC-JP, use a Japanese username and repeat \nthe above procedure.\n\nMy point is that you cannot guarantee that all steps of the authentication \nprocess, including the registration process, on both the client and server \nside results in the *same* binary representation of a national character, \nunless the specification clearly specifies which binary representation is \ngoing to be used. And in an international environment like HTTP is used \nin, the best binary representation of a string of national characters is \nthe 8 bit encoding of Unicode, UTF-8.\n\n> The username value is already covered by the existing rule for TEXT:\n\nAFAICT (from a quick look) Apache 2.0 is not able to parse a RFC 2047 \nencoded parameter (Oh, and BTW: the RFC 2047 encoding does not have a very \ngood syntax for parameters, e.g. name==?a?Q?value?= , it is not without \nreason that it's been updated by RFC 2231).\n\nAFAIK nobody are using the RFC 2047 encoding, especially not for \nauthentication. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong.\n\nAssuming that UTF-8 is not mandated for Basic username and password and \nDigest username, I would recommend that RFC 2231 encoding is recommended \nfor the Digest username, instead of RFC 2047, as 2231 is better suited for \nencoding parameters, and that it is clearly stated in the RFC.\n\nHowever, the problem about which binary representation is used in \ncalculations MUST also be addressed (should the encoded or the decoded \nversion of the credentials be used, and should they be converted to a \ncommon character set, if possible?). Not mandating UTF-8 will just move \nthe problem around.\n\nCome to think of it: Perhaps the *TEXT rule in RFC 2616 sec 2.2 should be \nupdated to mandate UTF-8 instead of iso-8859-1? But that is probably too \nbig a change to do at this time.\n\n-- \nSincerely,\nYngve N.

(Despite the subject of that message, that\nspecific message is about 100 Continue and when to send it).\n\nThe others are:\n\n   2. Clarification of whether LWS is permitted before the colon in\n      headers.  Various people understand the RFC differently, as can\n      be seen in their implementations.\n\n   3. Require agents to reject messages with malformed field names,\n      and perhaps field names which have LWS before the colon,\n      because not doing so leaves open certain security holes due to\n      proxies and other intermediate agents not recognising or filtering\n      headers that are interpreted by another agent.\n\n      Notably, headers with LWS _before_ the field name should be\n      rejected.  (Yes, certain widely used software treats it as part\n      of the name when it's the first header line, instead of as a\n      continuation line, and other widely used software skips the LWS\n      there).\n\n      If LWS is not permitted before the colon, messages with that\n      should be reject as well.  (Even if it's decided that RFC2616\n      permits LWS there, in my opinion it makes sense to decide that\n      LWS should not be permitted there, and require implementations\n      to reject any message which has it.  Nobody sends messages with\n      LWS there (because most agents don't accept it), and rejecting\n      it closes a potential security hole.

The Patch header on any OPTIONS response indicates that\n00>   the server supports the PATCH method and at least one delta format.\n00>   When the OPTIONS request addresses a specific modifiable resource,\n00>   the Patch header in the response indicates which delta formats may be\n00>   used for this specific resource.

For an\n'OPTIONS' request whose request-uri was '*', the Allow header can\nrefer only to the server as a whole, which doesn't tell you whether or\nnot a method in the Allow header will be acceptable for any particular\nURI (just as you describe above); for that you need to probe the URI\nthat you're interested in, either with OPTIONS or some other method.\nIn a WebDAV context, where multiple requests for the same resource are\ncommon, I would think that there would often be an opportunity to\npiggyback this on something else.\n\nI'd also suggest that for clarity you use 'Accept-Patch' as the\nresponse header to indicate what patch types are supported by the\nserver.\n\nSo your first example:\n\n00>   OPTIONS request and response indicating Patch support\n\n00>       [request]\n\n00>       OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1\n00>       Host: www.example.com\n\n00>       [response]\n\n00>       HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n00>       Patch: application/gdiff, text/xcap+xml\n\nshould, I think, be:\n\n          [request]\n\n          OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1\n          Host: www.example.com\n\n          [response]\n\n          HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n          Allow: PATCH, ...\n          Accept-Patch: application/gdiff, text/xcap+xml\n\nand a specific use case:\n\n      [request]\n\n          OPTIONS /foo/bar.xml HTTP/1.1\n          Host: www.example.com\n\n      [response]\n\n          HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n          Allow: PATCH, GET, HEAD, PUT, OPTIONS, TRACE\n          Accept-Patch: text/xcap+xml\n\nand a PUT example showing that the capability can be passed with\nanother response:\n\n      [request]\n\n          PUT /foo/bar.xml HTTP/1.1\n          Host: www.example.com\n\n      [response]\n\n          HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n          Allow: PATCH, GET, HEAD, PUT, OPTIONS, TRACE\n          Accept-Patch: text/xcap+xml\n          Etag: \"xi30qkd0a\"\n\n\n\n-- \nScott Lawrence        \n  Pingtel Corp.   \n  sip:slawrence {at} pingtel.com  \n  +1.781.938.5306 x162\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-6524652"}, {"subject": "Re: Using OPTIONS for optional feature discovery &ndash;&ndash; advic", "content": "Scott Lawrence wrote:\n> 00>   Note that byte ranges are already used in HTTP to do partial\n> 00>   downloads (GET method).

The byte range syntax could be extended, but I don't see\nthe point.\n\n-- Jamie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-6538393"}, {"subject": "Re: Using OPTIONS for optional feature discovery &ndash;&ndash; advic", "content": "Lisa Dusseault wrote:\n\n> I am working on the next version of the HTTP PATCH method proposal:\n> http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dusseault-http-patch-00.txt\n> \n> We've had some discussions amongst WebDAV people of the best way for \n> clients to discover server feature support.

And it is a major pain -- if an app changes a single byte, you\nreally don't want to have to do a PUT on that entire 3 gig file.

Most servers don't follow that\nrequirement, however. IIS/6 and Apache certainly don't. (I just tested the\nformer against www.microsoft.com, and I already know Apache doesn't)\nSo... since a server isn't going to punt on an unhandled Content-Range,\nthen you really can't rely on just sending it and assuming the server will\nfail back to you if it doesn't understand it.\n\n> is even worse -- the authoritative source will then replace the full \n> resource with a corrupted, partial resource.

The proposed PATCH method and even existing diff formats\nseem to support the above use case reasonably well.\n\nCan you think of any reason why PATCH with common diff formats cannot\nsupport the above efficiently?\n\nI was under impression that you are talking about supporting large\nvolume of micro updates (e.g., remove a single character in the middle\nof a 100MB file) that must be committed in real time, one by one.\nDoing so efficiently may require mechanisms different than proposed\nPATCH.

Apple?\n\nIn the current implementation of the Mac OS X WebDAV file system, \nopening a file on a WebDAV file server causes a GET and the resource is \ncached in a file on the root file system. While the file is open, all \nchanges are made to the local cache file. The cache file (if changed) \nis pushed to the server with a PUT when the file system receives a \nfsync or close request. So most of the time, there is a single PUT when \na file is changed on the server. Since the PUT replaces the complete \nresource, a file is always in a consistent state after the PUT is \ncomplete.\n\nIf PATCH were available, I'd have to decide whether to use the existing \n\"cache file\" model, or use the buffer cache used by the rest of the Mac \nOS X file systems. If I were to stick with the cache file model, then \nI'd keep track of what portions of the cache file have been changed and \nsend a single PATCH request to the server when a fsync or close is \nreceived. If I were to switch to use the buffer cache, I'd send a PATCH \nrequest whenever memory pressure causes the buffer cache to write a \nfile's dirty buffer(s) to the server. That would mean that the resource \non the server might be in an inconsistent state at times -- this would \nnot be different than other network file systems.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-6995188"}, {"subject": "Re: PATCH thoughts..", "content": "There's no diff format chosen by DeltaV, but RFC3229 identifies several \nfor HTTP:\n\n     RFC3229: Delta encoding in HTTP    \nhttp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3229.txt\n\nVCDIFF is a RFC, and GDIFF is a W3C Note -- those have been used by \nIETF in the past.\n\nLisa\n\nOn Apr 30, 2004, at 2:50 AM, Jamie Lokier wrote:\n\n> Alex Rousskov wrote:\n>>> So please voice your opinions on this issue to help me off this\n>>> fence.

It may be an interesting \nfeature, but to fully define it, the spec will need to say more about \nthat topic (I personally feel that overloading COPY and/or MOVE with \ncontent modification operations would be a bad idea...).\n\n > 2.

I'd say that Last-Modified should be returned always.\n\n3. Thought: there may be servers without good ETag support (for instance \nwhen using filesystem-based backends). If we require the server to \ncompute MD5 checksums, we can also require it to check the MD5 of the \ngiven entity *before* the modification. In WebDAV speak, that would be a \nnew state token for the \"If\" header; however for a spec that doesn't \nrequire WebDAV as base protocol, we may have to define a new request \nheader, such as \"If-Content-MD5-Match\". This would make PATCH \nextra-safe, and we wouldn't need to worry ETag support.\n\n > 2.2.2  Error handling\n >\n >    This proposal uses the same mechanism as DeltaV to add much-needed\n >    info to base HTTP error responses.

Also, if this spec \nadopts RFC3253-style error handling, it should stay consistent with \nRFC3253 (in RFC3253, the names identify *conditions*, not *errors*; thus \nthe individual codes need to be reversed, such as \n\"delta-format-supported\" instead of \"delta-format-unsupported\").\n\n >    DAV:delta-format-unsupported: Used with 501 Not Supported status\n >       code.

It's a\nmatter of server policy.  I think at least some unix servers won't\nalter the mtime of a file if you open it for writing but don't write\nanything - as some patch operations conceivably might do.\n\nAlso, even if the server definitely does recording the time of the\npatch as the last write access time, and uses that as part of the\nETag, the time used for the Etag usually has a granularity (often 1\nsecond).  So it might still not change the ETag.\n\nIf a server is only using the POSIX mtime field for an ETag then it\nshould probably not call it a strong ETag.

COPY and MOVE are fully \ndefined in RFC2518 and are independent from PATCH.  The reason these \nare mentioned, is because somebody asked if PATCH could be used to get \nthe source from one URL, but place the result in another URL -- and \nCOPY or MOVE combined with PATCH can achieve nearly the same thing \nwithout any new specification required.  I will however try to make the \ntext a little clearer in that MOVE and COPY can be used as is, \nindependently of the PATCH proposal, to rename or copy an entity before \napplying PATCH to it.\n\n>\n> > 2.

It only makes PATCH more \ncomplicated to define how it acts on new resources.  Note that the \nclient is perfectly capable of using PUT to create an empty resource, \nand diff formats are perfectly capable of applying a diff to an empty \nresource -- but I would think that generally clients would prefer to \nPUT at least a significant chunk of the resource content when creating \nthe resource.\n\n>\n> >    The PATCH request MUST have a body.

Some \nclients do make OPTIONS * requests.\n\nIt's not a MUST because as you point out, some servers cannot do this.  \nThis tension between the desirability of OPTIONS * and the \ninfeasibility of it is a tension that I do not intend to resolve in \nthis specification.\n\n>\n> >    Example: OPTIONS request and response for specific resource\n> >\n> >\n> >        [request]\n> >\n> >        OPTIONS /example/buddies.xml HTTP/1.1\n> >        Host: www.example.com\n> >\n> >        [response]\n> >\n> >        HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n> >        Allow: GET, PUT, POST, OPTIONS, HEAD, TRACE, DELETE, PATCH\n> >        Accept-Patch: example/xcap+xml\n>\n> Shouldn't \"vcdiff\" appear here?\n\nI'm of two minds about this.

Is OPTIONS * dead?  Is it useful?  Both?\n\nI had always seen OPTIONS * to be very useful.  At Xythos, we went to a \ndeal of effort to make it work even though the Xythos WFS was a java \nservlet-based technology.  Xythos WFS worked with clients that expected \nto find useful information in OPTIONS *, including the Xythos WFC \n(before that, Teamstream behaved the same way, I think).  The clients \nlooked for features advertised in OPTIONS *, so that the client would \nknow whether it would be worthwhile querying individual resources for \nfurther detail on supported features.\n\nSome clients, like Microsoft clients, use OPTIONS '/', which can be \njust as hard or harder for the server to support than OPTIONS *.  And \nif the server doesn't advertise a major feature in OPTIONS * or OPTIONS \n/, then the client doesn't bother looking for the feature on individual \nURLs -- it's probably too prohibitive to do that roundtrip on every \nresource visited.  I think that a server implemented today that didn't \nput features in OPTIONS * or OPTIONS / would find that some clients \nfailed to enable features that would otherwise be enabled.  This may be \nmost true for WebDAV features like locking.\n\nI'm now in the position of developing a WebDAV client from the ground \nup, rather than a server, as I've done before.  I assure you that the \nclient would rather have some indication (in OPTIONS * or OPTIONS / or \nelsewhere) that a feature might be supported somewhere in the \nrepository.  This is so that a GUI can show a button as enabled or \ndisabled right away, as the client navigates through a bunch of \nresources.  For example, the \"lock\" button should be visible on the \ntoolbar when the user is navigating a repository that might support \nlocking somewhere -- but the \"lock\" button should be at least greyed \nout, if not absent, when the user is navigating a repository that \ndoesn't support locking at all.\n\nDevelopers hate uncertainty, but users are generally better at dealing \nwith it than we think they are.  It's a principle of good user \ninterface to show affordances for things that might be possible.

This is not the same problem as addressed in delta\nencoding (i.e., server push replication) and does not need IM\nas a solution.  Failure to define vcdiff and gdiff in the media type\nregistry is no excuse for adding complexity to HTTP.  I would\nrather see the specification define \"application/vcdiff\" and\n\"application/gdiff\" in the appendices, which it is certainly\ncapable of doing on behalf of the IETF, rather than allow media\ntype registration exemptions just because the owners had no\nneed for those types.\n\nThere is no reason to require that the resource already exists\n(such a requirement is nonsensical in any case, since in HTTP the\nresource is the temporal invariance found in mapping of URI to content,\nnot some file in storage).  The requirement should be that the PATCH\nmedia type define whether an existing representation is necessary\nor not, which is trivial for the server to discover when applying\nthe patch (it is a conflict, like any other conflict).\n\nThere is no reason to require that PATCH be subject to the same\naccess controls as PUT.  The methods are orthogonal and implementers\ndo not need to be constrained.  Yes, that is a logical implication\nfor use of WebDAV ACLs, but that doesn't make it a requirement\non all implementations.\n\n\"The PATCH request MUST only be used in a context which ensures\nthat only one user may apply a patch at a time ...\" assumes a\nparticular application (content replication) that is not necessary\nas a requirement on the protocol. In particular, this requirement\ndisallows the primary purpose of the original PATCH method, which\nwas to support collaborations among multiple authors working on\ndifferent parts of the same representation.  Yes, conflicts are\npossible in such situations, but they can be handled by the process\nof applying each PATCH and responding with appropriate error codes --\nthey do not need to be legislated out of existence by overzealous\nstandards.  In fact, most reliable differencing mechanisms include\ncontent verification via context or hashing; there is no need to\nrequire that the simple HTTP mechanisms of Etag and If-Match be used\nwhen the client is capable of making that choice on their own, and\nthe server is capable of handling that choice based on the existing\nHTTP/1.1 protocol and orthogonal to the definition of PATCH.\nRequirements within the core protocol must be reserved for design\ndecisions that are necessary for interoperability, not those that\nare dependent on a particular application of that protocol.\n\nThe PATCH response should not be limited to 204 -- there are many\napplications that might want to know whether fuzzy matching was\nused to apply the patch.  The spec should define that the response\nindicates what the server did.  An improvement would be to include\nany metadata in the response that was either modified or might\nindicate modification, but that is better done within the body of\nthe response rather than mixing response metadata with that of the\npatched representation.\n\nUse of DELTAV status reporting is completely unnecessary.  The HTTP\nstatus code is more than capable of indicating the reason for failure,\nand explicit indication of what parts of the PATCH could not be\napplied will have to be specific to the supported diff format in\nany case.  A more reasonable mechanism would be to define a\ncorresponding error format for each differencing format, since\nunderstanding of that format will be necessary for a user agent\nto explain what changes (not what parts of the diff file) have\nbeen rejected.  We can't define a universal XML response because\nmost diffs cannot be enclosed within XML without additional\nencoding (such as base64), nor can we assume that line numbers\nare meaningful to binary differencing formats, though I suppose we\ncould define a uniform way of counting the number of delta commands\nper format and uniformly indicate errors by reference to those\nnumbers.\n\nServers SHOULD NOT support the VCDIFF format until its IP restrictions\nare clarified and made available royalty-free for all uses of HTTP,\nat a minimum, and not just use within HTTP/1.1 as defined in 2001.\n\nThere is no reason for a server to advertise support for this\nmethod via OPTIONS *.  This is a resource-specific implementation\nquestion and does not need any more support from OPTIONS than\nis already provided for all methods.  Clients should never be\nencouraged to make global requests on a server for information\nthat is resource-specific; servers don't work that way and all\nit does is recommend that the client waste bandwidth.\n\nAside from what is noted above, I do think that PATCH should be\na standard part of HTTP and needs an appropriate specification.\n\n\nCheers,\n\nRoy T.

In your case, the message has a lower, not higher version\ncompared to the proxy version, and the above downgrading rule is\nspecific to requests, not responses.

That answers my question.\n\nI've been investigating the various workarounds in popular HTTP\nservers and proxies, to see what folklore a new internet-facing server\nshould include for robustness.\n\nJust fyi, I was looking at this part of Apache's default config:\n\n  BrowserMatch \"MSIE 4\\.0b2;\" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\n\nThe \"nokeepalive\" directive disables persistence if a request comes\nfrom a user-agent containing \"MSIE 4.0b2;\" _and_ if there's no Via header.\n\nThe \"downgrade-1.0\" makes the server pretend it's a HTTP/1.0 request.\n\nThe \"force-response-1.0\" makes the server send \"HTTP/1.0\" in the\nresponse.\n\nI wanted to decide whether the latter two can be ignored if there's a\nVia header -- so that the user-agent pattern matching may be skipped\naltogether.  Same applies to the other BrowserMatch directives.\n\nOf course the only way to be sure is testing, but you have given me\nconfidence that it is fine to omit all the user-agent checks which\naffect hop-by-hop if there's a Via header.\n\n> Versions are supposed to be a hop-by-hop mechanism.\n\nYes, but because of some broken HTTP implementations there are\nworkarounds deployed.  I wondered if a proxy would forward a HTTP/1.0\nresponse and label it as if the sender was HTTP/1.0 as part of the\nworkarounds which kept the net working in 1997 or so.\n\n> There are a few proxies that support many HTTP/1.1 features but do\n> not use HTTP/1.1 versions.

Here is a probably outdated HTTP/1.1 checklist for Squid:\nhttp://devel.squid-cache.org/squidhttp1.1.htm\n\nNote that announcing HTTP/1.1 support buys you little.

Although it isn't documented, Squid also has a workaround\nwhich disables keep-alives with Netscape 3.x -- one which Apache\ncuriously doesn't have in its default configuration, although Apache's\ndocumentation mentions it.  Squid's workaround is also only done if\nVia isn't present.\n\nSo that's fine.\n\nforce-response-1.0 means the server announces HTTP/1.0 instead of\nHTTP/1.1.  If it's true that real HTTP/1.1 proxies do _not_ pass along\nthe HTTP version announcment of the response (hence the subject of\nthis thread), and HTTP/1.0 proxies always announce HTTP/1.0, then\nforce-response-1.0 would have no effect on the broken clients when the\nrequest is via a proxy.\n\nSo that's fine if it's disabled by Via.\n\ndowngrade-1.0 is really there to disable chunked responses.  If real\nHTTP/1.1 proxies _do_ convert non-chunked responses from the server to\nchunked HTTP/1.1 responses to the client, assuming the client\nannounced HTTP/1.1, then downgrade-1.0 would not be effective in this\ncase anyway.\n\nThat means the only functional place for that workaround is at the\nnearest proxy to the client, if the proxy is HTTP/1.1.  It is not\neffective at the server if there's a proxy and it converts a\nnon-chunked response to HTTP/1.1 chunked.\n\nI guess that one depends on the behaviour of real proxies.  So that's\nbanother question: do real deployed HTTP/1.1 proxies convert\nnon-chunked responses to chunked?\n\n> Many things in the path may add Via headers, some of which are not\n> even HTTP proxies. Consider ICAP servers, for example (RFC 3507).\n\nThe question is whether those things modify the hop-by-hop\ncharacteristics of the message -- i.e. HTTP version, keep-alive, and\nchunkedness.  Hmm.  I'd guess ICAP servers would have to, simply\nbecause deployed origin servers already check Via for determining\nwhether to apply a nokeepalive rule.\n\n> IMHO, the Internet still works on workarounds, to a large extent. This\n > sad situation is not going to change until we aim higher than just\n> \"running code\". I am not sure we ever will.\n\nIndeed, I was not too impressed at the code in _any_ of the servers\nand proxies I looked at for parsing HTTP headers.  They work as long\nas their peers send politely formatted messages.  Message headers with\nembedded CRs and spaces in the field names and continuations are\ninterpreted in lots of different ways.\n\n> Note that announcing HTTP/1.1 support buys you little.

Certainly, it specifies that\nthe host is mandatory, yet hosts are often omitted\nin HTML documents.\n\nHowver, there is nothing inherently wrong with\nusername:password appearing in an *HTML* document,\nand the browser subsquently interpreting that\ninformation to form a Authorization: header\nin response to a WWW-Authenticate: challenge. \n\nAs we all know, http://username:password@www.example.com is not\nsent literally over the wire.  And neither is\nhttp://www.example.com:8080/index.html?var=something,\nbut rather \n\nGET /index.html?var=something HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n\nand the client *knows* automagically to \nconnect to port 8080.\n\nTo make a long story short, as long as the\nover the wire protocol is respected, is there\nreally anything proscriptive in 2616 with regard\nto the appearance in an *HTML* document? The only\nthing that username:password@ causes in *HTTP*\nwhen the browser finally gets around to it,\nis the addition of:\n\nAuthorization: blahblahblah\n\nin response to WWW-Authenticate.\n\nTo go really far out in left field, there is\nnothing in 2616 to stop an html author from\ndisplaying the username/password on the page\nand asking the user to key it in when challenged.\nNor does it say that IE cannot store a username\nand password for the \"remember password function\".\n\nIf the argument is that 3.2.2 prescribes the\nsemantics of the href attribute of the HTML <A>\ntag, then there is a lot of broken HMTL code\nout there because it quite common to use\neither root relative, or relative URL's in\nhref attributes.  The fact that common browsers\nknow what to do about this would be due to\ntheir interpretative abilities.  By extension,\nusername:password@ is also an interpretive\nability.\n\nAnd it's all in the HTML, it's got nothing to\ndo with HTTP over the wire.  At least in\npractical terms.\n\nBTW, it was mentioned in a forum elsewhere\nthat this change would break a lot of\nPaypal payment links.

At work we have a number of \nusers who have bookmarked internal FTP servers as ftp://user@host/path \nin IE. Will this upcoming patch also break user[:pass]@ within ftp: \nURLs? How about other schemes that use the Common Internet Scheme Syntax \n[CISS] outlined in RFC 1738?\n\nAs you might guess, I believe it would be nice if KB 834489 were updated \nto explicitly address ftp: and other schemes handled by IE.\n\nAnd I wonder about the potential for attacks based on ftp: URLs; if the \nIE team's response to the 0x01 is eliminating CISS, then I'd expect them \nto eliminate it throughout IE, affecting more than just http(s) schemes.\n\nIt looks like 0x01/CISS is a concern in IE6/XP for ftp: URLs. Some quick \ntesting shows that clicking on a link coded as\n   <a \nhref=\"ftp://anonymous:www.microsoft.com%01@mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/\">go</a>\ndisplays in the IE Location bar as \"ftp://anonymous:www.microsoft.com\" \n-- so presumably if an attacker made their FTP server ignore both \nusername and password contents, the attacker could use HTML like\n   <a href=\"ftp://www.microsoft.com%01:bogus@mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/\">go</a>\nor perhaps set up \"www\" as the anonymous account, ignore the password \ncontents, and use an attack URL like\n   <a href=\"ftp://www:microsoft.com%01@mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/\">go</a>\nto trick the intended victim. Sure, \"ftp://www.microsoft.com\" and \n\"ftp://www:microsoft.com\" don't look quite right to those of us who are \nRFC-literate (neither has a URI/path), but they might look good enough \nto fool a good number of users (hey, we're dealing with users who still \ndouble-click any attachment that comes their way).\n\nThanks & happy new year,\n\nPeter\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-7655441"}, {"subject": "Re: ftp://user[:pass]&#64;host/ ? -OT mispost, my apologie", "content": "Peter Watkins wrote:\n\n> Paul,\n> \n> In brief:\n\n<snip>\n\nMy apologies to all; that message had nothing to do with this WG's \nbusiness, and I only intended it for Paul.

Authority Component, without\nspecific application.\n\nGoing back to HTML 4.01(as an example), it\npermits at 2.1.3, Relative URIs. But, RFC2616\nmakes no allowance for Relative URI's.\n\nAnd that is exactly what I am getting at in\nmy earlier message.  The protocol has nothing\nto do with what is on the HTML page and what\na browser does with an element on the page.\n\nThe thought that I had in the last few days\nwas:\n\nIs it not possible, when username@password is\nencountered, to pop up the usual login dialog\nbox with the elements filled in? The dialog\nbox already shows the authentication domain.\nThis would require an explicit action on \nthe part of the user and gives the user\nnotification that an authentication is \nbeing attempted and the host that the user\nis going to.  \n\nIt is the *silent* bypassing of this dialog \nthrough the *interpretation* of username@password\nthat is causing it to be a difficulty in the \ncase at hand. Popping up a dialog box is much\nless draconian than ignoring username@password\naltogether.\n\nSince Monday, I have received correspondence from\na very large e-commerce payment system who are\nconcerned with this very problem.  I can tell by\nfrom the email address used to receive the correspondence\nthat the inquiries did not result from my posting\nhere on the list, but rather were related to \nsearching for a solution.  This company\nis the number one ranked company in their payment\nmethod. They know that the proposed change\nwill break their systems at the customer level.\n\nThey are not happy campers.

I wanted to know if it was\ntechnically ok to add the Vary header unconditionally - and more\nimportantly, if that would work according to everyone else's reading\nof the standard.\n\n> Note that a valid Accept-Language cannot be empty.

The two paragraphs I cited seem contradictory, given a\nstrict reading of the language.\n\nTo cut to the precise language which is ambiguous:\n\n   *all of the selecting request-headers present in the new request\n   match the corresponding stored request-headers in the original\n   request.*\n\nIn my understanding of English, if the marked text begin with \"each\"\ninstead of \"all\", it's unambiguous but means the wrong thing.  (It\nmeans to try each selecting request-header in the new request, and one\nat a time match it against the corresponding stored request-header).\n\n\"All\" in that position can mean _either_ the same as \"each\", or that\nall the new request-headers are taken as a set and matched against all\nthe stored request-headers as a set, in one single match operation.  It\ndepends how you parse the quantifier.\n\nMatching as a set is wanted, and the next paragraph confirms that\ninterpretation, although it wasn't until you drew my attention to it\nthat it made sense to me that way.\n\nBetter language may be:\n\n   When the cache receives a subsequent request whose Request-URI\n   specifies one or more cache entries including a Vary header field,\n   the cache MUST NOT use such a cache entry to construct a response to\n-  the new request unless all of the selecting request-headers present\n-  in the new request match the corresponding stored request-headers in\n+  the new request unless the set of selecting request-headers present\n+  in the new request matches the set of selecting request-headers stored in\n   the original request.\n\n   The selecting request-headers from two requests are defined to match\n   if and only if the selecting request-headers in the first request can\n   be transformed to the selecting request-headers in the second request\n   by adding or removing linear white space (LWS) at places where this\n   is allowed by the corresponding BNF, and/or combining multiple\n   message-header fields with the same field name following the rules\n   about message headers in section 4.2.\n\n+  Headers may be named in the Vary field value which do not exist in\n+  one or both requests.  Headers which are named in the Vary field\n+  value and do not exist in one request are matched if and only if\n+  the corresponding headers do not exist in the other request.\n\nThat last paragraph is a logical consequence of the preceding two\nparagraphs, if you read them the right way.  However, I have read the\nstandard many times and implemented a HTTP/1.1 server, and not\nunderstood that logical consequence until now.  So the extra\nclarifying paragraph is suggested.\n\nThanks,\n-- Jamie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-7757036"}, {"subject": "HTTP Basic Authenticatio", "content": "I am building a system that is constructed using servlets and JSPs, I also utilize Session?s and client cookies.  \n\n \n\nI am curious if I am truly implementing Basic Authentication or a mutated version of that.

Running under HTTPS removes the\nfundamental security concern, exposure of open text credentials, but it is\na stateless protocol. Each client request must carry the credentials which\nmust be validated by the server.\n\nIf my memory hasn't failed, a client is permitted to anticipate that a new\nURL is part of a particular realm and offer the credentials. Certainly,\nonce the specific URL has had user entered credentials, the clients\nsend the same credentials on the next request. I have observed in the past\nthat some clients may send the same credentials for other URLs which\nreference the same 'directory' or even child directories.\n\nThe server must sent the 401 when it doesn't believe the client is\ncorrectly authenticated, either because there were no credentials or the\ncredentials are wrong. It is a slippery slope to expect a user to be\nprompted if 401 is sent in response to correct credentials. There is\nno protocol mechanism for requesting a client purge credentials.\n\nThe only influence the server has over the user authentication dialog is\nthe 'realm name' so usability is poor at best. I haven't seen a moderate\nto high volume production site in years which uses basic or other client\nsupported authentication. That of course isn't an exhaustive survey. I\nfind basic authentication most useful in situations where the web security\nrequirements are equivalent to physical security satisified by an\nunguarded locked fence. Perhaps a beta release of a new version or a\na design review where you want to avoid access by casual browsers and\nrobots.\n\nApplication controlled authentication provides the most robust user\nexperience and the most server flexibility. In simple terms, include a\nlogin page which authenticates the user and then uses a cookie or URL\ndecoration to track the user session.

The server will not have put Connection: close\nin the response header, unless that was requested by the client, or it\nwas HTTP/1.0 without keep-alive, or some other conditions applied.  So\nthe server will transmit the response...\n\nAnd then it has to shut down the connection, right?  (All the while\nreading data from the client to avoid the TCP RST problem).\n\n> > If you have enough information to begin the response just from reading\n> > the request headers, then you are free to send the response headers\n> > right away; even the 1xx response is optional - you can skip right to\n> > sending the final response.

What I'm saying is: if I _don't_ send 100\n(Continue), I don't see a way to determine whether the client _chose_\nto not transmit the request entity _despite_ the Content-Length or\nTransfer-Encoding headers.  Therefore, after doing that, there's no way\nfor the server to read another request, and it must shut down the\nconnection.\n\n(Btw, any Transfer-Encoding indicates a request body, and \"chunked\" is\nrequired to be the last in the sequence of transfer-codings.  If\nContent-Type specifies \"multipart/byteranges\", that indicates a body,\nbut I see nothing in RFC 2616 which indicates a body for any other\nmultipart encoding.  Right?)\n\nBut now on yet more diligent reading of RFC 2616, I have a question.\nThis whole mail revolves around the question so I'll make it stand\nout:\n\n    If the client sends Expect: 100-continue, and receives an HTTP/1.1\n    (or later) response which is not preceded by 100 (Continue), is\n    the client allowed to send more requests on that connection\n    _without_ transmitting the request entity?\n\n> > Or can it avoid reading the request entity completely, by not sending\n> > 100 (Continue) and somehow determining when the next request arrives\n> > on that connection.  Is that possible?\n>\n> No, but even if it were it wouldn't save you anything - TCP is a stream;\n> there's no way to discard the bytes other than at the receiver (without\n> closing the connection, that is).\n\nEh?  If you don't send 100 (Continue) then it does save you quite a\nlot: the client might not transmit the request entity at all!\n\nAlso, if you stop reading at the receive, eventually the TCP window\nfills and the transmitter stops, which reduces data transmitted\noverall if not all of the request entity is read.  That may or may not\ncause deadlock, depending on the transmitter's logic.  We can avoid\ndeadlock while reading the minimum at the server, by reading only when\nthe data is needed, writing response as we generate it, and if writing\nblocks, then reading until writing is unblocked, buffering the read data.\n\nThis is the logic I have now.  Assume in every case that the\nconnection is persistent: the request doesn't have Connection: close,\nand it's HTTP/1.1.\n\n  1. If the server sends a non-error response, without 100 (Continue)\n     and without observing any request entity prior to sending the\n     response, then it must not try to read another request because of\n     the ambiguity as to whether the client actually sent the request\n     entity or not.  Is this correct?\n\n  2. If the server sends an error response, without 100 (Continue) and\n     without observing any request entity prior to sending the\n     response, then it must not try to read another request for the\n     same reason.  Is this correct?\n\n  3. If the server sends a *non-error* response, after 100 (Continue),\n     and before reading all of the request entity, it can assume the\n     client will send all of the request entity or abort the connection.\n\n     In this case if the server doesn't want to read all of the\n     request entity, because it knows the entity is large and there\n     is no point transferring the remaining data, then after it has\n     completely sent the response entity it should signal connection\n     shutdown (i.e. TCP FIN, shutdown(SHUT_WR)), and continue reading\n     for a while to prevent the TCP RST problem.\n\n     If the server does want to read all the request entity after it\n     has started sending the respones, it can just do that and it\n     should work.\n\n  4. If the server sends an *error* response, after 100 (Continue),\n     and before reading all of the request entity, it must assume the\n     client MAY prematurely abort transmitting the request entity\n     either by closing the connection or transmitting a zero length\n     chunk.\n\n     In this case if the server doesn't want to read all of the\n     request entity, because it knows the entity is large and there\n     is no point transferring the remaining data, then it doesn't have\n     to shutdown the connection.  The client may terminate the request\n     entity with a zero length chunk allowing the connection to\n     continue.  However, the client might not, so if there's a lot of\n     data still coming in, the server may choose to shutdown the\n     connection, in the same way as for 3. above, a short time after\n     sending the error response and failing to see the client\n     prematurely terminate the request entity.\n\n     If the server does want to read all the request entity after it\n     has started sending the response, it cannot.  It has to _delay_\n     sending any of the response until all of the request entity has\n     been read.\n\n  5. Because of the different required behaviours in 3. and 4., due to\n     RFC 2616 section 8.2.2, the server and client must agree on what\n     consitutes an \"Error Status\".\n\n     Clearly 4xx and 5xx codes are; 1xx and 2xx are not.\n     It isn't clear whether 3xx codes are errors.\n\n     If there is disagreement either way, there are problems.  If the\n     client receives a 3xx and treats that like a non-error, it will\n     continue transmitting the request entity.  For the server to\n     terminate that transmission, to save bandwidth and inform the\n     client that it doesn't need all the response, it needs to\n     shutdown the connection after the response is transmitted, in\n     this case.\n\n     If the client receives a 2xx and reacts in the same way as for an\n     error status, it may prematurely terminate the request entity by\n     sending a zero length chunk, or it may close the connection\n     which, although always allowed perhaps due to user abort, is not\n     expected for non-aborted non-error requests.  Therefore for the\n     server to not cause premature request entity termination, it must\n     _delay_ sending the response until it has read the whole request,\n     in this case.\n\n     So if there is any disagreement among implementations over what\n     is an Error Status for the purpose of section 8.2.2, this creates\n     a third category of responses that the server must treat\n     differently from 3. and 4.  I see this category containing 3xx.\n\n     If one of these responses is generated within the server, and the\n     server wants to read all of the request entity eventually, then\n     it must _delay_ sending any of the response until all of the\n     request has been read.  However if the server does not want to\n     read all of the request entity, it cannot assume the client is\n     likely to prematurely terminate the request entity by closing or\n     sending a zero length chunk.\n\n     So the server's behaviour with this category of responses is\n     different from its behaviour for responses which are consistently\n     treated by implementations as errors or non-errors.  It has to\n     use this third, more conservative strategy.\n\n  6. If the server transmits a response, and in so doing discovers\n     that it doesn't need any of the request entity, then it can avoid\n     sending 100 (Continue).\n\n     However, if it does not send 100 (Continue) is it true that it\n     mustn't try to read another request on that connection?  I'm not\n     sure.\n\n     If the server discovers it doesn't need any of the request\n     entity, but it would like the keep the connection persistent, it\n     needs to use a different strategy for non-error and error\n     responses:\n\n         a. For non-error responses, if the request entity is known\n            to be small from the Content-Length header or otherwise,\n            it may be worth the server sending 100 (Continue) prior\n            to the response anyway, reading the whole request entity\n            and discarding it, and continuing to read another request.\n\n         b. For non-error responses, if the request entity is known\n            to be large, or the server doesn't wish to encourage\n            an unknown size transmission over the network from the client,\n            the server will avoid sending 100 (Continue), and instead\n            shutdown the connection (carefully, avoiding the TCP RST\n            problem) after sending the response.\n\n         c. For error responses, the size of the request entity is not\n            important.  The client will abort sending the request entity,\n            and make an appropriate decision on whether to continue using\n            the connection.\n\n            100 (Continue) must be still be sent by the server if it\n            wants to use the connection persistently after the error\n            response.  Is this correct?  (I'm not sure).\n\nThis translates to the following logic in server code.  I would be\ngrateful to anyone who can offer corrections to or insight into this\nlogic.  It seems more complicated than I'd expected to need for\nimplementing lazy request entity reading for an application running on\ntop of the server.\n\n    a. In all of the steps below, where it says transmit 100 (Continue)\n       that may be avoided if some request entity has already\n       been received.\n\n    b. While transmitting the response, if at any time the\n       transmission is blocked for writing, the server should try to\n       read data from the client and save it for when the server\n       application reads it, in order to resolve deadlock with less\n       tolerant clients and large messages that fill TCP windows.\n\n    c. As soon as the server application tries to read any of request\n       entity, transmit 100 (Continue).\n\n    d. If the application generates a *non-error* status, and might\n       need to read some of the request entity but hasn't yet,\n       transmit 100 (Continue) before the status.\n\n    e. If the application generates a *non-error* status, and has\n       already read or tried to read some of the request entity,\n       transmit the status immediately.\n\n    f. If the application generates a *non-error* status, and is\n       already able to commit to not needing any of the request\n       entity, but the size of the request entity is believed by the\n       server to be sufficiently small that it's worth reading in\n       order to maintain a persistent connection, and the connection\n       is still eligible for persistence (neither side has transmitted\n       Connection: close), transmit 100 (Continue) before the status.\n\n    g. If the application generates a *non-error* status and is\n       already able to commit to not needing any of the request\n       entity, and the request entity is not believed by the server to\n       be small enough to read in order to maintain a persistent\n       connection, transmit the status without 100 (Continue).\n\n    h. If the application has already generated a *non-error* status\n       and is subsequently able to commit to not needing any more of\n       the request entity than it has already read (which may be\n       none), there is no need for the server to continue reading from\n       the client except as noted for deadlock avoidance (b.), or if\n       the server is going to read the whole request entity anyway (f.).\n\n    i. If the application finishes handling a request and it generated\n       a *non-error* status, and did not read all of the request\n       entity, and the connection is still eligible for persistence\n       (neither side has transmitted Connection: close), and the\n       server believes that the amount of request entity that has not\n       yet been received is small enough to be worth receiving in\n       order to maintain a persistent connection, then it should read\n       the remaining request entity and continue using the connection.\n\n    j. If the application finishes handling a request and it generated\n       a *non-error* status, and did not read all of the request\n       entity, and the server believes that it is not worth receiving\n       the remainder of the request entity, it should politely\n       shutdown the connection, with a \"lingering close\" to avoid TCP\n       RST problems.  Deadlock avoidance is required in conjunction\n       with the lingering close as with (b.), by continuing to read\n       incoming request data rather than letting the TCP receive window\n       fill.\n\n    k. If the application generates an *error* status, and might need\n       to read some of the request entity but hasn't yet, *delay*\n       transmitting the status until the application has completed\n       handling this request, or can otherwise commit to not\n       needing the request entity, or does actually read the\n       entity and the *whole* entity has been received, or at least\n       as much as the application will need of it.\n\n    l. If the application generates an *error* status, and has\n       already read or tried to read some of the request entity,\n       *delay* transmitting the status until the *whole* entity\n       has been received, or at least as much as the application\n       will need of it.\n\n    m. If the application generates an *error* status, and is already\n       able to commit to not needing any of the request entity,\n       transmit the status immediately.  The size of the request \n       entity is not important, because the client is expected to\n       prematurely abort a long one.\n\n    n. If the application has already generated an *error* status and\n       is subsequently able to commit to not needing any more of the\n       request entity than it has already read (which may be none),\n       there is no need for the server to continue reading from the\n       client except as noted for deadlock avoidance (b.).  However,\n       if the connection is still eligible for persistence, the server\n       should continue reading for a limited time, number of bytes or\n       other policy determined by the server (see o.), speculating\n       that the connection will be used for another request.\n\n    o. If the application finishes handling a request and it generated\n       an *error* status, and did not read all of the request\n       entity, and the connection is still eligible for persistence\n       (neither side has transmitted Connection: close), the server\n       should continue to read and discard the request entity.  The\n       client should prematurely terminate the request entity, although\n       it might not.  Therefore the server should read and discard\n       only for a limited time, number of bytes, or other policy\n       determined by the server, and if the end of the request is not\n       seen by then it should politely shutdown the connection, with\n       a \"lingering close\", as in (j.).\n\n    p. If the application generates a status which it's thought some\n       clients may treat as an error and some as non-error for the\n       purpose of RFC 2616 section 8.2.2, a conservative mix of the\n       above rules is required.  3xx status codes might be in this\n       category.\n\n-- Jamie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-7933821"}, {"subject": "Re: Can the response entity be transmitted before all the request entity has been read", "content": "Joris Dobbelsteen wrote:\n> Requests and responses are *always* fully completed.

I had managed to figure that out, more recently than my\nmail on the subject :)\n\n> Just ignore the 100 response. The protocol behaves exactly with or without\n> it.\n\nI can't ignore it: I'm writing a HTTP/1.1 server.  I must send the 100\nresponse at the appropriate time, to prevent the client delay.  Also\nit's a protocol requirement: section 8.2.3.  OTOH I don't want to send\nit if I'm generating an error response.  Pretty much what 100 is for.\n\nI delay sending the 100 response until the application (which sits on\ntop of the server) asks to read any of the request entity, which makes sense.\n\nThe complications arose from the question of what to do when the\nserver application doesn't read any of the request entity.\nConservatively the HTTP server just reads it anyway, but I was trying\nto apply a close to optimal set of rules.  The obvious thing to do is\nnot send 100, so that the client might not sent the entity.\n\nBut I've looked a bit harder, and RFC 2616 section 8.2.3 states:\n\n      - Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header\n        field with the \"100-continue\" expectation, an origin server MUST\n        either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read\n        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The\n        origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending\n        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status\n        code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue\n        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It MUST NOT\n        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.\n\nThat final MUST NOT indicates that if my server application generates\na non-error response, i.e. a response which indicates it _did_ perform\nthe requested method, and the server application doesn't ever ask for\nany of the request entity from the HTTP server, the HTTP server must\n_still_ send 100.\n\nOk.\n\nFurthermore, the HTTP server _must_ read _all_ of the request entity.\nIt cannot abort, because there is no way to know when the client\napplication has read the response.  It is possible to know when the\nclient's TCP stack has acknowledged all the response, but the client\n_application_ might not see that data until it has sent all the request.\n\n> I believe the above would impact most of your questions, as I believe you\n> get meaning of this response incorrect. \n\nYes I did.  I thought it meant the client could choose not to send the\nresponse at all.  (Actually, for \"Error Status\" responses (section\n8.2.2), the client _can_ choose not to send a response, as you\nobserve: the client can send a zero length chunk.  It can't do that\nfor non-error responses).  My understanding of 100 (Continue) is now\nadequate.  Thank you :)\n\n> *Remark* on the chunked transfer from clients to servers. I don't know\n> whether implementations actually send a zero-sized chunk after getting a\n> response. This behaviour might be implementation specific. I rather believe\n> clients would complete the entire request.\n\nIf it's an Error Status they SHOULD send the zero-sized chunk or close\nthe connection.  Section 8.2.2 is quite prominent.  This has nothing\nto do with 100 (Continue), by the way, it's orthogonal to it.\n\nConsequently, if I'm generating an Error Status with a body, like a\n404 with explanation page that *uses* the request entity to generate\nthat page, my server MUST NOT send the Error Status until reading\nentire request entity.  If it did send the Error Status earlier, the\nclient is supposed to abort sending the request which the server needs\nto construct the page which goes with that 404.\n\nHowever, if I'm generating a 200 response where the page uses the\nrequest entity, it appears I can transmit that before the request\nentity is all read.\n\n> When sending a entity body to the server and you receive a 3xx\n> response, this means the request is redirected.

Can 303?  It's allowed for a 303 response to\ncome with an explanatory page which _might_ be generated using data\nfrom the client request entity.\n\nI'll be conservative and assume clients are allowed to abort the\nrequest entity on 3xx responses too (for 8.2.2).  *But* I have to be\nconservative and assume I'm not allowed to transmit a 3xx without 100\nwhen 100 is indicated (for 8.2.3): 303 being a valid response for a\nPOST method which *is* performed.\n\n> After an error you should close the connection when:\n> 1) You are not sure about the state (e.g. after 400 bad request).\n> 2) Client is sending data and you don't want to waste bandwidth on it.\n\nYou can't fully close the connection, however, because of the TCP RST\nproblem.  And the client SHOULD abort the request with a zero length\nchunk, but I haven't got as far as testing any clients for that yet.\n\n> >After transmitting the response entity and discovering that it \n> >didn't need the request entity after all, and it wasn't an \n> >error response, it's too late for the server to change the \n> >response headers: they are transmitted already.

From RFC 2616, I think that a client _should_ display\nan Error Status response correctly even if it is close-delimited, and\nthe (unidirectional) close reaches the client before the client has\nfinished transmitting.  It's clear that real web servers have to keep\nreading at that point to make sure clients to eventually see the\nerror.  It's also clear that a client which doesn't keep monitoring\nthe stream for an error, i.e. tries to send an entire large request\nfirst, won't look too impressive to its user: the server should always\nbe able to refuse a large upload, quickly.\n\n> >> > If you have enough information to begin the response just from \n> >> > reading the request headers, then you are free to send the \n> >response \n> >> > headers right away; even the 1xx response is optional - \n> >you can skip \n> >> > right to sending the final response.

Section 8.2.3, about the origin server: \"It MUST NOT perform the\nrequested method if it returns a final status code.\"  Here final\nstatus code means without a preceding 100 (Continue), and with none of\nthe conditions for omitting 100 (such as already seeing some of the\nrequest entity).\n\nIf it MUST NOT perform the requested method, that means it must be\nsending an _error_ final status code, as a success code means that it\ndid perform the requested method.  Slightly round the houses logic I\nknow.\n\nThis includes at least some, maybe all, of 3xx.  I.e. for the purpose\nof section 8.2.3, 3xx responses are in the same category as 2xx\nresponses.\n\n> The request headers will ALWAYS be followed by the entity body. There is no\n> way of cancelling transfering the entity body, other than to close the TCP\n> connection.\n\nYes, I've got that now.

A fair heuristic would be\nwait for all ACKs for the data, then add a time limit for the client\napplication to read it from the client OS's TCP stack.  (If the\napplication doesn't read it soon enough, the request entity still\nflowing to the server causes the server's closed socket to send RSTs\nto the client OS, which then discards received data before the client\napplication can see it.)\n\n> A 3xx (Redirection) indicates the server will not handle the response and\n> will redirect it to another server. These is no point in this respect to\n> transfer the data to the server and aborting the connection would seem the\n> only logic one.\n\nSure, but what do actual client implementations do?  If the spec\n_stated_ that 3xx responses are errors for the purpose of 8.2.2, fine.\nBut I don't see the language in the spec as indicating that at all\nclearly.\n\nIn my mind, some 3xx responses are informative.  Certainly, 302, 303\nand 307 are often used by servers wishing to direct the client around\nthe URL space of theserver, e.g. to append \"/\" when a URL corresponds\nto a directory, or as an alternative form of content negotiation.\n\nIn particular, 303 is supposed to be used after a *successful* POST,\nwhich wants to redirect the client to follow it with a GET.  That's\nnot an error at all.\n\nSo they're not really *errors*.\n\nAlso you said there's no point transferring data.  Servers certainly\ntransfer some data with 302/303/307 responses: a small page telling\nolder clients that there's a redirection, with a link.  That page can\ndepend on the request entity, especially if it's a 303 in response to\na POST.\n\nAnyway I'll conservatively assumes clients treat 3xx like errors for the\npurpose of 8.2.2 -- i.e. they may abort the request entity, so if the\nserver's application wants to read the request entity, it must delay\nsending the status line until it's read all of the request.\n\nAt the same time, because 3xx aren't errors, I have to treat them like\n2xx for the purpose of 8.2.3.\n\nFwiw, these are the rules my server now implements:\n\n    - If the application asks for any of the request entity, send 100\n      (if required by Expect: 100-continue or the PUT/POST rule).\n\n    - If the application generates a 2xx status, and it hasn't sent\n      100 yet, send it with the status (if required by....rule).  It\n      is always sent, even if the application doesn't show any\n      interest in the entity (because of 8.2.3).\n\n    - If the application generates a 4xx/5xx status, and it hasn't\n      asked for any of the request entity, send the error status\n      without 100 and prevent the application from seeing any of the\n      request entity.\n\n    - If the application generates a 4xx/5xx and it does want the\n      request entity, send 100 (if required by....rule), then read the\n      entire request, and _then_ send the status line response\n      (because of 8.2.2).\n\n    - If the server application generates a 3xx, regardless of whether\n      the application wants the request entity (because of 8.2.3) send\n      100 (if required by....rule), then read the entire request,\n      _then_ send the status line and response (because of 8.2.2, and the\n      possibilities that clients might abort the request entity when\n      they see a 3xx response).\n\nThe question of how to abort connections is another thorny one.  With\nerror responses, we want to close the connection after sending the\nresponse and not reading the whole request but have to do so in a\ncareful way to be confident the client application sees the error.\n\nWith non-error 2xx responses (this is totally a guess based on how I\nimagine some clients to be written), we might find that closing the\nconnection after sending the response and not yet having read the\nwhole request may lead clients to ignore the response, or to abort the\nrequest.  So my conservative *guess* as to the right thing to do is to\nsend the status line as soon as possible (unlike for error responses),\nbut to refuse to send the close (for close-delimited) or zero chunk\n(chunked) or final byte (content-length) until the all of the request\nentity has been received.\n\nThat looks more complicated than necessary -- but is it?  Does anyone\nhave knowledge of how different well-known clients react to receiving a\nwhole response before all the request has been read?\n\nThanks,\n-- Jamie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-7960306"}, {"subject": "RE: Can the response entity be transmitted before all the request entity has been read", "content": "Jamie,\n\nThis would be a short summary of my comment:\n(Please correct me if I'm wrong anywhere)\n\n\nJust ignore the 100 response.

The serer is unwilling/unable/... to\nhandle the request.\nThe behaviour can be similar to the error responses (4xx and 5xx), because\nin this case the server is also unwilling/unable to handle the request.\n\nAfter an error you should close the connection when:\n1) You are not sure about the state (e.g. after 400 bad request).\n2) Client is sending data and you don't want to waste bandwidth on it.\n\nYou should not close the connection when:\n1) The state of the protocol is known (404 response)\n2) You are willing to waste any more bandwidth on data from the client, you\nwill not handle.\n\n\nThere is some more inline...\n\nHopefully this clears up some questions.\n\n- Joris\n\n>-----Original Message-----\n>From: ietf-http-wg-request@w3.org \n>[mailto:ietf-http-wg-request@w3.org] On Behalf Of Jamie Lokier\n>Sent: Friday, 12 March 2004 20:07\n>To: Scott Lawrence\n>Cc: ietf-http-wg@w3.org\n>Subject: Re: Can the response entity be transmitted before all \n>the request entity has been read?\n>\n>\n>Scott Lawrence wrote:\n>> > I'm not entirely sure if this means _network_ errors (such as TCP \n>> > shutdown or reset), or HTTP Error Status codes 4xx and \n>5xx.

Due to the fact that the user agent was\nunable to complete the request, this mgiht result in an error, despite\nreceiving the entire response correctly.

There is no\nway of cancelling transfering the entity body, other than to close the TCP\nconnection.\n\nWhen analyzing the protocol, you can simply ignore the 100 reponse.

The server\nwill always expect a entity body.\nThe reasons are quite simple:\nFirst of all, the client is allowed to start transfering data to the server\nwithout waiting for the 100 response, regardless of the Expect header.\nSecond, there is NO way for a server (or a proxy) to distinguis a request\nfrom an entity body. The entity body might look like a valid request, but is\nin fact just data.\nCancelling an upload should always result in closing the connection.\n\n>\n>> > Or can it avoid reading the request entity completely, by not \n>> > sending 100 (Continue) and somehow determining when the \n>next request \n>> > arrives on that connection.

It seems quite logic to terminate sending after a\nfull request has been received. This might vary between implementation how\nto handle such situations. I don't recall the spec defining any behaviour in\nsuch cases.\n\n>\n>     So if there is any disagreement among implementations over what\n>     is an Error Status for the purpose of section 8.2.2, this creates\n>     a third category of responses that the server must treat\n>     differently from 3. and 4.

It does actually nothing, only indicate the\nclient should send data immediately and not wait for a possible error\nclosing the connection. The request/response behaviour is exactly the same\nwith or without the 100 response!\nThe 100 response was primarily designed to saves bandwidth. When an error is\ndiscorved early (such as 404), this saves sending the entity header. In this\ncase the connection MUST be closed, because the server will expect the\nentity body first and not a new request first.\n\n>This translates to the following logic in server code.

You see in the above example, _not_ giving the application a\ncontrol knob implies that the server reads the whole request before\nsending any of the application's response, or refuses to let the\napplication read anything after any response has been sent.\n\nThat's contrary to most server implementations: they do give the\napplication control over when to read and write, which is the opposite\nof what you're suggesting here.\n\n> Give your applications just the basic knobs that minimize the amount\n> of guess work on the proxy.

I am so far following the advice in RFC 2616, which is to send\n100-Continue if Expect: 100-continue is received and it's HTTP/1.1 or\ngreater, or if it's HTTP/1.1 (exactly that version) and it's POST or PUT.\n\nIs that advice good?\n\nNot sending 100-Continue is always safe, but may introduce delays.\n\n> Do not expect clients to be able to recover from receiving responses\n> prior to them sending complete requests.\n\nThat's a crucial question.

It's for\napplication writers to be aware of it.\n\nYet, I want to document it if it's a real practical issue, because I\ncan see good uses for sending response before the request is all read:\na translation or file format server, which writes part of the\ntranslation before all the text is uploaded, and an upload meter,\nwhich writes some text as a large upload progresses, perhaps showing\nthumbnails of the uploaded files as each one arrives too.\n\nIf these things are not possible, or if they have to be implemented in\nother ways such as multiple frames so that uploads are separate\nrequests from the progressive display, or if they work with most\nclients and there are a few known ones where it must be prevented,\nthen I accept that.\n\nI'd simply like to know whether it's best to program the server to\nenforce that, knowing it's a common/rare client weakness, or to not\nenforce it but recommend it in the application interface\ndocumentation, or to permit it if it actually works in practice.\n\n> Do not spend time deciding when to close a connection in the\n> presence of strange traffic: close as soon as you can, usually right\n> after sending the final response (erroneous or otherwise).\n\nMy strategy is to copy Apache's well-tested \"lingering close\":\nshutdown(fd,SHUT_WR) followed by reading everything for up to 30\nseconds, or until 2 seconds passes with no incoming data, then the\nfull close().

Importantly, the rule for implied *LWS says\n\"Except where noted otherwise, ...\".  In other words, implied LWS is\n_only_ implied where the text does not \"note otherwise\" something else.\n\nI think this is an example of the text \"noting otherwise\", even though\nit does not explicitly say that it is noting otherwise.\n\nThat means there is no logical contradiction with _not_ allowing LWS\nbefore the colon.  Unfortunately, both interpretations fit.\n\n> The fact that implementations vary does not prove that this wording\n> implies something; there are other, more important, reasons for\n> implementations to vary on the subject.\n\nSure, but the fact that _all_ implementations I've seen of servers,\nexcept for the new Apache behaviour, implement no LWS before the colon\nstrongly indicates that is how people are reading it.  I know a lot\nof implementers are sloppy about following the RFC, or have other\nreasons for ignoring it, but some of the authors are quite\nconscientious and there is no compatibility problem with writing code\nwhich accepts LWS there.  So we can conclude that authors who were\nconscientious understood the text to apply, and that it was one of the\n\"Except were noted otherwise\" instances of the implied LWS rule.\n\nI honestly thought the same, until I saw the Apache patch.  Even\nthough I'd wondered about the implied LWS, I took a guess that the\ntext describing the header syntax is an instance of \"noted otherwise\".\nAnd as you know I'm quite conscientiously following the RFC where possible.\n\nSo, I'm saying the standard is ambiguous at that point -- either\nreading is possible, and a clarification would be good.\n\n> >     2.

Proxies\nand servers alike should reject it, rather than forwarding tunneling it.\n\nWhy?  Because passing them along, in either direction, enables the\nexact remote security exploits which motivated the patch to Apache to\nallow LWS before the colon.  There is also the problem of CRs: Apache\ndoesn't remove CRs before the colon, but it does treat CR as LWS at\nother places where tokens are scanned.  Other clients and servers are\ndifferent, so there it is plausible that a CR may be used as \"LWS\"\nwhich Apache doesn't trim but something else does.\n\nIs it not better to reject messages which are clearly out of spec?  It\ndepends whether there are practical reasons to keep forwarding them.\nIn the case of control chars and LWS in header names, I think there\naren't, but I have not done any surveys to guage it seriously.\n\nDo you see, that changing Apache in that way, while possibly correct,\nfixes one obscure security flaw while introducing another.  Neither\nbehaviour results in a secure server.\n\nAs regards what the spec should say, I suggest it should be\nunambiguous where appropriate, and it should lead the way in\nindicating how servers SHOULD reject certain constructs for security\nreasons, even if it will be a long time, if ever, before the\nrecommendations are actually widespread among implementations.\n\nPresently I find the syntax of headers is ambiguously presented,\nprecisely because you can understand the text is an instance of the\n\"except where noted otherwise\" clause for implied *LWS, or you cannot.\nBoth interpretations make sense linguistically to me, and even if I'm\nwrong, it indicates clearer text is appropriate.\n\nAnd, even though the syntax does not allow control characters or lone\nCRs in headers, and probably does not allow LWS before the field-name\nof the first header line, it would be good for the RFC to suggest a\npolicy among implementations, of making a point of rejecting those.\n\nWithout guidance from the RFC, implementors will do exactly what they\nare doing: copy each other, and do the simplest in the belief that\nreal web servers have to do that sort of thing to be robust in the\nreal world.  Perhaps they do, perhaps they don't, but most\nimplementors will take into account guidance from the RFC and other\nrelated documents, if it is available.\n\nI think it's reasonable for the RFC to suggest implementation SHOULD\nreject such headers, instead of letting the implementor make an\nunguided decision, because it is easy, probably not harmful (this\nshould be checked empirically of course), and prevents a number of\ntheoretical and subtle security flaws due to different programs having\ndifferent interpretations of non-compliant header names.\n\nThis is different from a blanket suggestion to reject all invalid\nsyntax: it's not reasonable for the RFC to suggest implementations\nreject field _values_ which don't match the grammar.  That is likely\nto break real setups.  The former is a good in real life (I am\nguessing; maybe something really depends on it); the latter is not,\nand the RFC may as well say so.\n\nFwiw, my implementation strategy is to read the RFC and related RFCs,\nand to read the code for a number of servers and clients in order to\nfigure out in what ways deviation from the RFC or extra rules are\nneeded for the real world.  Unfortunately, there's no way to determine\nwhether an implementation quirk that lots of programs have in common\nis needed for the real world, or just like that for other reasons,\nlike everyone copying each other, or it being an obvious ad-hoc\nimplementation method.\n\n-- JAmie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8114903"}, {"subject": "Re: Can the response entity be transmitted before all the request  entity has been read", "content": "On Mon, 15 Mar 2004, Jamie Lokier wrote:\n\n> Alex Rousskov wrote:\n> > In that case, the most reliable strategy in the presence of\n> > questionable traffic is often to switch to a tunnel behavior and\n> > terminate the connection as soon as the response is sent.\n>\n> I see that is the most common strategy :).

If you can reliably convert garbage\ninto compliant output, do so.

I don't\nlike that deadlock because it isn't necessary and it is practical to\neliminate it in the server.  It's messier to eliminate it in the\napplication, and anyway why do it once per application instead of once\nin the server?\n\nYou're thinking: out of memory.  Actually no.  To avoid deadlock, this\nis what I do: If writing would block, and there is data available to\nread, read it.  The buffer holds _read_ data, and is therefore limited\nby the maximum permitted request entity size.  The maximum is asserted\nboth for content-length and chunked requests.  The buffer is required\n*somewhere*, either in the server or in the application itself, or in\nbacking storage for them, so there is no added resource consumption\nfrom this technique when it's implemented properly.\n\n> > I'd rather put the hard requirements, and every feature that will\n> > help with robustness, in the _server_, rather than document it as a\n> > requirement that applications have to follow.

It's not at fault for being smart, it's\nthat it's code simply has a bug.

That's the\nonly effect on the buffering algorithm: it ends up buffering up to one\nmaximum size request entity per request, and the overall memory and\ndisk management for that can certainly be constrained.\n\nNote that the response doesn't get buffered infinitely.  Response\ngeneration is blocked while the request is being buffered up for\nwhatever reason.\n\nIt's not possible to omit the buffering *somewhere*: for clients which\nsend a whole request before reading the response, the entire request\nhas to be buffered or stored *somewhere*, either in the server or in\nthe application, to resolve the deadlock.\n\n> It is possible to have an HTTP-to-Applications API with enough logic\n> and controls that optimizations you mention are very appropriate and\n> safe.

If there are clients which accept the\nnon-error response before all the request is read, that is certainly a\nfeature worth letting the app have access to.\n\nThe reason I asked all this is that if practically all real clients\nfail with it (I haven't reached the stage of testing yet), then the\nserver may as well constrain the app, probably by complaining at it.\n\n> > I'd simply like to know whether it's best to program the server to\n> > enforce that, knowing it's a common/rare client weakness, or to not\n> > enforce it but recommend it in the application interface\n> > documentation, or to permit it if it actually works in practice.\n> \n> Make your HTTP-to-application proxy as simple as possible.

Now give me advice as application author: I'd like to know\nwhether it a common or rare client weakness, so whether I should\nconsider using that technique or not.\n\nIf there's only some well known, old clients which don't like it, then\na match on the User-Agent string which activates the request entity\nbuffer will be the right thing to do.  The server can include it in\nthe plethora of other User-Agent quirks it already works around.  (I'd\nrather put such knowledge in the server which already has that buffer\nfor deadlock avoidance, than in N applications).\n\nIf, however, lots of clients don't like it, then it isn't worth using\nthe technique at all, and it would be better for the server to\ncomplain when the app erroneously tries it -- even if it's just a\nwarning which can be disabled.\n\n> > My strategy is to copy Apache's well-tested \"lingering close\":\n> > shutdown(fd,SHUT_WR) followed by reading everything for up to 30\n> > seconds, or until 2 seconds passes with no incoming data, then the\n> > full close().\n> \n> Cool. I hope this well-tested algorithm is not what breaks CGIs in\n> Apache 2 :-).\n\nThe algorithm has been in Apache 1 for quite a while.\n\nBut maybe  Apache 2's version of it is to blame. :/\n\nApache 2's algorithm is different -- I think it is a coding error, not\nintentional.  Apache 1 does what I describe above.  Apache 2 tries to\nread with a 2 second timeout up to 30/2 times, and each read is 512\nbytes max.  That means if the socket's receive buffer _already_ has\n512*15 bytes in it, Apache 2 will terminate the lingering close\nimmediately, even if there is more data incoming from the client.\nThat seems very wrong: incoming data from the client after close is\nwhat causes the transmitted data to be lost, which is why Apache 1\nkeeps trying until it sees a 2 second gap, which heuristically means\nthe client has stopped sending.\n\n> Also, FWIW, I recall half-close causing many problems\n> for Squid proxies for a while. It is probably fixed now.\n\nI don't see how it could be a problem: server half-close with a\ntimeout (the 30 seconds timeout is still important) is invisible to\nthe client, except in terms of the timing.  The sequence of events the\nclient is able to observe is identical (unless the client is _so_\nclever that is queries the socket to learn how much data has been\nacknowledged by the server, but I'm sure Squid doesn't do that).\n\nIn effect, half-close with a 30 second timeout is equivalent, at the\nsocket interface level, to the network deciding to delay data flowing\nfrom the client to the server for 30 seconds, so that the TCP RST\neffect where response data disappears can't happen.  A real network\ncan cause a similar effect, so if half-close was causing Squid\nproblems, those problems would occasionally occur with real network\ndelays too.\n\nThanks,\n-- Jamie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8167339"}, {"subject": "Re: Can the response entity be transmitted before all the request entity has been read", "content": "Jeffrey Mogul wrote:\n> Also, as I understand the paper, what they showed is that while\n> if everyone fully (and correctly) implemented the 100-Continue\n> specification of RFC2616, everything would be fine, we didn't\n> successfully design this feature to interoperate with RFC2068.\n> We also apparently said \"MAY\" instead of \"MUST\" in at least one\n> place, so partial (but legal) implementations of RFC2616 might\n> be a problem.\n\nThank you!  It is a most excellent paper.\n\nThe conclusion for someone writing an RFC2616 server is that \"MAY send\na 100 [...] in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request\" must be\nimplemented as \"MUST, after a timeout, ...\" (or with no timeout), to\navoid certain deadlocks.\n\nOther conclusions apply for someone writing a proxy or client.\n\nNeither Apache 1 nor 2 actually do that, so I presume the theoretical\ndeadlock isn't a problem in practice.\n\nProbably because the few clients which do wait for 100 (Continue), if\nthere are any at all, implement a reasonably short timeout before\nsending the request entity anyway, even though that's prohibited by\nRFC2068.\n\nHow wonderfully unclear.\n\n- Jamie\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8190154"}, {"subject": "Re: Can the response entity be transmitted before all the request  entity has been read", "content": "On Tue, 16 Mar 2004, Jamie Lokier wrote:\n\n> Alex Rousskov wrote:\n> > >      write \"Status: 200\\n\\n\";\n> > >      write \"Thank you for your submission.\\n\";\n> > >\n> > >      while ($x = read (...)) { store ($x) }\n> > >\n> > >      write \"Great, all done.\\n\";\n> >\n> > While it is easy to imagine such an application, tasking a proxy\n> > to \"rewrite\" or \"fix\" application logic to fit HTTP restrictions\n> > seems like a bad idea.

I am arguing that a general-purpose server\ncannot resolve such deadlocks using a simple tunnel interface.\nApplications acting unusually should bare the responsibility of\navoiding deadlocks, not the server.\n\n> I don't like that deadlock because it isn't necessary and it is\n> practical to eliminate it in the server.

You seem to be limiting request bodies to\nmaximum buffer size, which seems like a bad idea to me (but I am not\nsure).\n\nHere are the facts: An application does not read until it writes a lot\nof data. An application wants to write more than your server can\nbuffer. Your server can either pass those writes through or block\nthem. If your server passes those writes through, then your server\ncannot break the application (the application may still block due to\nclient behavior, but that is not your problem). If your server blocks\nthose writes, the application author will be after you with bug\nreports and tomatoes (\"It worked fine with Foo server!\").\n\nOf course, if you develop a specialized server for specialized set of\napplications, it is totally up to you how to handle early writes.\n\n> Note that the response doesn't get buffered infinitely.  Response\n> generation is blocked while the request is being buffered up for\n> whatever reason.\n\nAnd if request body is larger than your server buffer? Temporary\nbuffering is like network delay, it cannot cause new deadlocks.\nBuffering that depends on other buffer state may cause new deadlocks.\n\n> It's not possible to omit the buffering *somewhere*: for clients which\n> send a whole request before reading the response, the entire request\n> has to be buffered or stored *somewhere*, either in the server or in\n> the application, to resolve the deadlock.\n\nFor a baseline server algorithm, I would let broken clients and broken\napplications to resolve their problems without server participation.\nThe server has to buffer request headers to set environmental\nvariables and such. After request headers are processed, the server\nestablishes a tunnel for the application to talk to the client and\njust does chunk coding and/or connection termination management.\n\n> > Imagine an application that writes more than you can buffer before\n> > it reads anything.\n>\n> No.  The application can't do that: it will block when writing blocks.\n\nWith a simple tunneling server it will not block unless the client\ndoes not read. Again, it becomes a client-application problem which is\nwhat you want, as a server author, in a general case.\n\n> The server's large buffer is the size of a maximum _request_ entity,\n> and that storage is unavoidable one way or another.

If you have\ninsufficient information, I would suggest to allow possibly compliant\nbehavior by default. You can always implement complex\noptimizations/restrictions later.\n\n$0.02,\n\nAlex.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8199905"}, {"subject": "Re: draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev00 statu", "content": "Anyone hear from Jim Gettys lately?

In the example of Figure 1, the root node has a list\nof attributes including interfaces,\nprocess instance key, valid states, actual state, and data.  From this\nXML snippet, we can determine\nthe values and state of that process instance as well as the others\npossible.  This example shows a\npotential purchase order made by the SWAP working group chair using the\nconfiguration information\nprovided by an online PC manufacturer.  The SWAP protocol creates a\ntrackable process instance\nupon the request, but doesn't begin the execution of the process.  The\nmethod call returns a value of\n\"207\" Multi-Status indicating several different values are appropriate. \nIt turns out that the size of the\nmemory conflicts with the order configuration.  The customer can then\nchoose to TERMINATE the\npurchase order or amend it using the appropriate PROPFIND and PROPPATCH\nmethods for\nassigning particular values. \n  \n           >>Request \n           CREATEPROCESSINSTANCE /submit/order?proc=10 HTTP/1.1 \n           Host: www.widget-makers.com \n           Content-Type: text/xml \n           Content-Length: xxxx \n           Authorization: Digest username=\"skreddy\" \n             realm=\"skreddy@oracle.com\", ... \n\n           <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> \n           <?xml:namespace ns=\"SWAP:\" prefix=\"d\" ?> \n           <?xml:namespace ns=\"http://conf.pcmanufact.com/\" prefix=\"z\"\n?>\n\n           <d:swap> \n          \n<d:observer>http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/swap/chair.html</d:observer>\n\n           <d:name>equipment-purchase-process</d:name> \n           <d:subject>procurement</d:subject> \n           <d:description>New equipment purchase</d:description> \n           <d:contextData> \n                <z:processor>pentiumII</z:processor> \n                <z:memory> \n                     <z:size>256 Meg</z:size> \n                     <z:speed>60 ns</z:speed> \n                     <z:type>DRAM</z:type> \n                </z:memory> \n                <!-- \"name, billing address, etc.\" --> \n           </d:contextData> \n           <d:startImmediately>no</d:startImmediately><!-- \"available?\"\n-->\n\n           </d:swap> \n\n           >>Response \n           HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status \n           Content-Type: text/xml \n           Content-Length: xxxxx \n\n           <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?> \n           <?xml:namespace ns=\"SWAP:\" prefix=\"d\" ?> \n           <?xml:namespace ns=\"http://conf.pcmanufact.com/\" prefix=\"z\"\n?>\n\n           <d:multistatus> \n                <d:response> \n                     <d:processInstance> \n                         \n<d:href>http://www.widget-makers.com/status?proc=10.1 \n                          </d:href> \n                          <?-- \"other items as defined by process\" --> \n                     </d:processInstance> \n                     <d:propstat> \n                          <d:prop><z:size/></d:prop> \n                          <d:status>HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict</d:status> \n                          <d:comment>part unavailable</d:comment> \n                     </d:propstat> \n                     <d: propstat> \n                          <?-- \"other resource properties\" --> \n                     </d:propstat> \n                </d:response> \n           </d:multistatus>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8409619"}, {"subject": "Re: SWAP Exampl", "content": "Thanks everyone!

It is certainly reasonable that work \nitem, process instance (and activity instance for that matter) should be \nconsidered as having common class attributes. There are also some differences \nwhich were identified originally - essentially concerning practical aspects of \nbehaviour which might lead to specification or implementation inefficiencies. \nThis was what originally precluded a single definition of \"work\" which could be \nrecursively redefined to whatever level of definition detail was required.\nRgds, Dave Hollingsworth.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\noriginal message:\n\nLet me provide some (WfMC) background on work items; we have also had much \ndiscussion on the subject.\n\nWe have a hierarchy of work orientated objects\n7 process instance (which may have multiple threads)\n7 activity\n7 work item\n\nActivity is the smallest unit of work which is specified within the process \ndefinition\n(i) it has a single (human) resource specification (which may return a set of \npotential participants at run time)\n(ii) process navigation is specified in terms of (conditional) transitions \nbetween activities\n(iii) it contains a specification of IT tools or applications which are run to \nsupport the activity (typically either at desktop level in a user context or \nagainst some central services without a particular user context). Where multiple \napplications (within a single activity) are specified there is an additional \nparameter in the process definition to specify whether execution is sequential \nor parallel; where parallel execution is employed multiple participants may be \nassigned within the single activity.\n\nBeyond these aspects there is no definition of the work content of an activity. \n(For example, an activity that places an instruction on a screen for a user to \ndo something and signal to the system when it is completed has no defined work \ncontent as such within the process definition. The user may do the work manually \nor invoke his own IT tools outside the workflow system context.) \n\nThis model is adequate in many cases and with abstraction of an activity into a \nsub-process [with its own underlying activity structure] can support arbitrary \ncomplexity.\n\nSo why do we need Workitems?\n\nThe term work-item refers to an atomic unit of work presented to a human user, \ntypically via an in-tray. The workflow service is assumed to maintain a \nwork-list for each user which contains the set of work items available for \naction. The detailed operation of the work list mechanism is assumed to be \nvendor / system defined; two basic operational models exist\n7 push, where work is automatically forced to a user\n7 pull, where the user (or a desktop agent) selects and accepts items from the \nworklist \n\nWithin the client application interface we defined an API set for a client \napplication, typically a worklist handler or in-tray manager, to manipulate work \nitems in dialogue with the WFMS, essentially using the pull model. [Push \noperations can also be accommodated by use of a distribution agent accessing the \nworklist through a subset of the APIs.]\n\nGiven the above approach to defining activities, one could always infer that an \natomic activity exists as the bottom-most element of the work hierarchy; atomic \nin this sense meaning work allocated to a single participant [or processed in a \nsystem context] and associated with at most one IT application/tool. \n\nIn this case there would be always be a  one:one relationship between the \nworkitem and an atomic activity. The work-item would just represent the user \nmanifestation of the activity.\n\nHowever, many WfMC members were uncomfortable with this since it represents a \nheavyweight approach due to the system overheads potentially associated with \neach activity - e.g. audit & recovery data, system scheduling overheads, \nparticipant assignment and navigation. Hence we introduced the concept of a \nwork-item as a separate element of work hierarchy below the activity, but \nwithout all the overheads:\n7 all work-items within an activity share the same participant assignment \nrule(s)\n7 there is no conditional navigation through work-items within an activity \nmanaged by the workflow system; all workitems within an activity are assumed to \nbe actioned either sequentially or in parallel (specified by parameter within \nthe process definition)\n7 much simpler audit data requirements \n\nThere has been no attempt to standardise the detailed approach to the \npresentation of workitems to users - many different approaches exist using VB \napps, forms, mail items, applets, etc.\n\nFrom a SWAP perspective I would recommend a simple approach, also. The pull \nmodel maps quite simply into a web environment and a number of vendors already \nsupport browser based worklist handlers using CGI and server side interfaces \nbased on elements of WfMC interface 2 or similar. These could migrate easily to \na SWAP standard, if defined, for this type of functionality.  \n\nI believe work item management should be separate from the broader \ninteroperability issues, which are concerned with work initiation and \npartitioning between server domains at a process or sub-process granularity, \nwhereas work items are about local distribution of small granularity work.\n\nI hope this helps with some of the background. On a more general level I feel \nthere should be more dialogue between the SWAP group and WfMC, so please let me \nknow if there are other areas where we might usefully converse.\n\nRegards, Dave Hollingsworth\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDave Hollingsworth\nICL Applications & Technical Consultancy\nWfMC Technical Committee\nd.c.hollingsworth@x400.icl.co.uk\n+44 181 730 4112\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8507402"}, {"subject": "HELP with Method Name in SWAP header", "content": "I'm a little confused about something concerning the placement of\ncustom methods for SWAP in the HTTP header.  \nHopefully someone out there can point me in the right direction.\n\nI know that the SWAP methods, like PROPFIND or CREATEPROCESSINSTANCE\nare supposed to replace common HTTP headers like \"GET\" and \"POST\" - but when\nI try to send these SWAP methods to my IIS server - It doesn't see them!  \n\nIs there some config I have to do to get IIS to see methods other\nthan the standard HTTP methods?  \n\n\nthanks in advance,\nrich \n\n\n\n\nRichard Heim\nCSC - Integrated Systems Division\n6000 Lincoln Drive\nMarlton NJ. 08053\n(609) 983-4400 x4840\nrheim@jcals.csc.com\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8520482"}, {"subject": "Re: HELP with Method Name in SWAP header", "content": "Richard,\n\nFor your IIS server to recognize SWAP HTTP methods, you must add an\nextension to the server to identify these commands.

There were 70 people \nin attendance. \n\nThe meeting was chaired by Surendra Reddy , and minutes were taken by Mr.\nRohit Khare. Surendra Reddy began the BOF with an introduction. Next,\nArthur Hitomi, UC Irvine presented goals/requirements for SWAP.\nIn the final 25 minutes of the BOF, the microphone was opened up for \ndiscussion from the participants. Several participants noted that the \nproblem to be solved is not well defined. One participant felt \nthat IETF has RPC and process control should be IETF problem and If it can\nsolve workflow problem that would be good. IAB has expressed concerns \nover using HTTP protocol for SWAP transport. There has been lot of \ndiscussion on the clarity of the problem to be solved and its relation to \nother work in IETF like EDI, RPC etc. Applications Area Director, Keith \nMoore recommended participants to understand the problem and discuss\nit in terms that IETF community can understand the problem.\nAt the end of the meeting, a straw poll of the audience asked whether the \nIETF should continue to work in this area to, with an eventual view \ntoward forming an IETF working group. Majority of the participants\nfelt the problem is not defined well and once the problem is clearly\ndefined, there seems to be interest in moving forward. \n\nHere is the minutes from the SWAP BoF:\n======================================\n(Minutes taken by Rohit Khare, UCI)\n\nBob Moskowitz: re: using other groups' work. 1) just define a mime object,\nper EDI-INT/EDIFACT. 2) how can we distinguish this from the standard on\nport 80, so that firewall administrators can protect differently. IPP went\nthat route and it's basically not acceptable. 3) you must be able to upgrade\nto TLS within a clear connection to conserve port numbers\n- There is much contention over use of HTTP, and reuse of port 80 for other protocols.  Have to be careful what lessons you take home from IPP experiences.\n\nMark Day:\n- Schedule seems really unrealistic given that you don't even know what \n  transport is being used.it's going to solve all kinds of things and be \n  done in 12 months. It seems contradictory. \n\nFrank Dawson:\nThere are lots of different communities with different definitions and\nmodels; we don't want to spend the years WfMC did, but we do need an IETF\nterm base. Second, you seem to be bringing a solution to the IETF to be\nendorsed, in part. \n+ five interfaces to work on: process definition, UIs, invoked apps,\nengine-to-engine, administration. WfMC already did MIME bindings for the\nfourth. SWAP will address IF4, the fourth interface.\n- Some concern that a body was bringing work to the IETF for endorsement, rather than bringing a work area before the IETF so the IETF can work on it.\nSurendra: Going to implement interface 4 in the WfMC reference model.\nKeith Moore: This sounds a bit like a blanket statement.  The IETF doesn't \njust bless other group's work.  This is not the ADs view -- this is a choice \nthe working group can make.\n\nCarl-Uno:\n- With IPP, to solve the firewall problem, we introduced a new port for the \nIPP protocol. Feels that the IPP design of encapsulating the semantics of \nthe protocol inside a MIME type was a smart decision.\nKeith: that sounds broad; the goal of a BOF is to scope out what everyone\nwants to work on. We will not approve a working group to bless the WfMC\nwork. The goal of IF4 is being stated as a goal of the working group; that's\nfor the group to decide, not to decide in the charter. Not just a\nserver-server protocol, I hope.\n\nCarl Uno: in IPP we ended up using a different basic port for printing\nservice; you may want to as well. 2) a MIME object which can cross several\ntransports makes sense. \nNick: but just server-server deems the FedEx class of example\nout-of-scope. \n\nMark Day: the charter shouldn't have to reference another document for its\ngoals. \n- - just like the calendaring group, you may find a model/terminology document\ndeliverable to be useful\n\nKeith: the draft requirements are just that, individual contributions. \n\nDave Crocker: I'm fascinated to see that there will be draft requirements\na month before draft protocol in the milestones. A Charter is a contract:\nthe very first paragraph alone should state what will and won't be done. \n\nKeith state again the scope:\ndefine a protocols to start stop monitor the data of a process \ninstance, and facilitate the exchange of data between servers. \nInformal poll: who wants to work on that (very few); something else \n(slightly more); Lisa Li asked if everyone else here was to prevent a WG \nforming (larger still, but still a minority). \n* How many people are willing to work on this problem?\n1-3 hands.\n* How many people feel the problem isn't well enough defined to begin work?\nAbout 1/3 to 1/2 of the room raised hands.\n[??]\nfirst thing you have to do is define data\ninteroperability. Second, if it's process-to-process, rather than human,\nthere are a lot better ways than HTTP.\nMark Day: the answers you're giving here in person are not in the charter. \nIt's about Interface 4, it's about transport, etc are not words in the charter. \n\nFrank Dawson:\n- Charter needs some work.  Where is mailing list?\n- It would be helpful to have a model document which specs. out the model \n  domain, and lists terms, as a deliverable.  Many people have a notion of \n  workflow, and some of these views are contradictory.  Am concerned that \n  the requirements document has been stated as being already done.\n\nKeith Moore:\n- Requirements are *not* done.  Work performed before the start of the \n  working group are sugestions/contributions.\n\nDave Crocker: technologists often don't have a market story for their gadget;\nthe reverse in this case. \"The problem to address here is not workflow\" --\nIETF passed an RPC protocol. The transfer of control, marshalled data\nalready exists. As a consequence, a generic problem *in* bounds, is to talk\nabout process control in a distributed environment. The fact it includes\nsome workflow needs in the process is nice, but this is a simpler\nproposition, technically understood, and may recruit more people.\n\nDaniel PINKAS: this should not be about a protocol (as the group is\ntitled), but about data format. Sync vs. async transport are both good, but\nstill second level of importance. \n\nMike Spreitzer: Further, the abstract definition of the data is even more\nimportant than the data (so you can use different encoders, like XDR, etc)?\n- - what's your payload? \n+ process attributes: time used, input arguments, data generated. \n- - lavender polo shirt: what you just described sounds like a MIB. SNMP does\nhave these goals, too. It's just not clear what problem we're solving. \n+ scenario: buying a PC triggers all kinds of work processes with\nsubcontractors.\n\nDave Crocker: an exercise I do when a project remains fuzzy is to go through at\nleast three very concrete scenarios of that nature. An I-D ought to be\nsubmitted illuminating what real, mechanical probelms are to be solved. Try\nto define this in computer science stuff rather than marketing stuff. \ncontrol hypothesis: I'd do your scenario with EDI+small bits\nof workflow task info so that I can track it. Thus the payload is the EDI;\nthe workflow stuff is the metadata in the control channel.\nSurendra: that's right \nDave Crocker: I think that's not right. That's too coarse-grained. I thought\nthis was to actually get the work done, to mandate a series of actions. EDI\nis at the most significant interface point, very coarse. Is it an external\nrequest-and-monitoring interface or an internal instantiation bit?\n+ This is the former. We watch the entry point of the process (its URL) and\nmonitor that. \n- - is this (merely) something more interactive than EDI? \n+ SWAP gives an entry point for two workflow engines to interact. \n\nKeith: What I need to see: a few of the people in the audience to be\nconvinced there's a core problem that diverse people want to work on. I\nsuspect there may be one; but there's an implicit paradigm being used to\nexpress it -- there's a different expression that will resonate here. The\nother problem is that this is the second BOF, and that's the limit. The\ndescription of the problem will have to be different. \n\n** End of meeting ***\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8604756"}, {"subject": "Projects &amp; Posters WACC'9", "content": "My apologies for multiple recipients.\n\nI've been asked to solicit Posters and Research\nDemonstrations for the 1999 International Joint Conference on\nWork Activities Coordination and Collaboration (WACC '99)\nconference in at the Cathedral Hill Hotel in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, February 22-25, 1999.

There's a tradeoff\nat work here.  SWAP needs to define a common set of goals that\nalmost all workflow tool vendors need from theirs and other \nsystems.   Communicating across the network you have any\nnumber of transport mechanisms.  the Goal of SWAP is to provide\nricher transport and simpler notification than existing \nnetwork interfaces that can be standardized.   One one end of\nthe spectrum, you can simply use HTTP(/1.1) and embed all\nor your smarts into an XML form.  This is similar to the WfMC's\nMime bindings.  While the transport is simple, the overhead\nof computing smarts on the receiving end to accomplish a task\nrequires a) a lot of agreements and understanding between the\ntwo sites, and b) a fairly complex component to interpret\nthe swap and data calls.  On the other end of the spectrum\nis the full WfMC interface specs (or the OMG's Joint Flow).\nIt's a very rich, powerful, and robust set of interfaces, \nbut requires even more of a computing overhead on the\nreceiving and sending end.  The SWAP effort appears to be taking\na little different approach.  WebDAV has shown the benefits\nto having a little more powerful set of transport primitives.\nSWAP wants to incrementally add just a few more to better\nsupport cooperation and control.  By having a little more\nrobuts transport mechanism, you can have a much simpler\nmethod for cross-platform workflow control, invocation, management, \nmonitoring, etc.  The benefit being that the required infrastructure\non the sending and receiving side can be simplified when\ncomparing the requirements of supporting other workflow \ninterfaces and standards across the network.\n \n\nTake your example and write out the complete call.\nI am assuming your are invoking a remote workflow service.\nWrite out, what does the  URI look like, how are the parameters\nand data encoded, is the message synchronous or asynchronous,\nwhat are the side-effects and results, what are the message\nand error codes, what are the return values, how do you \nuse these values to accomplish the other goals?  The\ndevil's always in the details.\n\nAnywys, these are just my opinions and understanding.\n\nGreg\n\n\n > hello,\n > \n > i'm looking at the 9807 version of SWAP and ask why the data element in\n > messages is encoded as a list of name value pairs. why not just specify\n > \n > <!ELEMENT swap (interfaces, ..., data?) >\n > <!ELEMENT data ANY >\n > \n > and leave it to the respective processes to decide whether a list of pairs\n > suits them or whether a more structured encoding is better?\n > \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-8994800"}, {"subject": "Issue: Synchronous vs. Asynch", "content": "This might be an issue to consider.\nAssume that you invoke a remote workflow\nprocess across the Internet.

There's a tradeoff\nat work here.  SWAP needs to define a common set of goals that\nalmost all workflow tool vendors need from theirs and other\nsystems.   Communicating across the network you have any\nnumber of transport mechanisms.  the Goal of SWAP is to provide\nricher transport and simpler notification than existing\nnetwork interfaces that can be standardized.   One one end of\nthe spectrum, you can simply use HTTP(/1.1) and embed all\nor your smarts into an XML form.  This is similar to the WfMC's\nMime bindings.  While the transport is simple, the overhead\nof computing smarts on the receiving end to accomplish a task\nrequires a) a lot of agreements and understanding between the\ntwo sites, and b) a fairly complex component to interpret\nthe swap and data calls.  On the other end of the spectrum\nis the full WfMC interface specs (or the OMG's Joint Flow).\nIt's a very rich, powerful, and robust set of interfaces,\nbut requires even more of a computing overhead on the\nreceiving and sending end.  The SWAP effort appears to be taking\na little different approach.  WebDAV has shown the benefits\nto having a little more powerful set of transport primitives.\nSWAP wants to incrementally add just a few more to better\nsupport cooperation and control.  By having a little more\nrobuts transport mechanism, you can have a much simpler\nmethod for cross-platform workflow control, invocation, management,\nmonitoring, etc.  The benefit being that the required infrastructure\non the sending and receiving side can be simplified when\ncomparing the requirements of supporting other workflow\ninterfaces and standards across the network.\n\n\nTake your example and write out the complete call.\nI am assuming your are invoking a remote workflow service.\nWrite out, what does the  URI look like, how are the parameters\nand data encoded, is the message synchronous or asynchronous,\nwhat are the side-effects and results, what are the message\nand error codes, what are the return values, how do you\nuse these values to accomplish the other goals?

The duration of\nthis connection can be as long as you want, within reason and\npractibility.  If the server is not available, the connection is\nrefused, and the there is no question about whether the operation was\nhandled or not.\n\nIt is my belief that in order to satisfy the need of the workflow user,\na workflow server in general needs to be able know the exact state of a\nworkflow instance at the time that a user accesses it, and needs to\nleave the user knowning exactly what state it is in after the\ninteraction.  In my experience the time needed for a workflow server to\nswitch from one well defined state to another is very small.  It is\nhighly undesirable from the human perspective to take an action and not\nknow whether your action really \"took\".  This is a long-winded way to\nsay that a workflow engine always knows its (new) state at the time that\nis returns the result of the request.\n\nWhen you say that the \"terminate\" command is asynchronous, then what\nthat means is that there is an extra intemediate state between running\nand terminated.  For example, the request to terminate command puts the\nworkflow (unambiguously) into the \"waiting for termination\" state, and\nthat some other event (possibly internal to the workflow engine) takes\nit ultimately to the \"terminated\" state.  \n\nAs for clean-up, that might happen after termination, and might easily\nbe handled as a substate of the termination state (e.g.\ntermination.initial and termination.cleaned-up) \n\nIn my experience I have not seen the need to have this extra state while\nterminating a process instance.  It is worth finding out from people\nwhether they have a specific need for this intermediate state at this\ntime.  Without any evidence of a strong need, I would be inclined to\nstick with the terminate, suspend, and such commands as being\nsynchronous.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nKeith D.

Thus, naturally, the business process is async.\n\nThe question then is whether a single person's interaction with\nthat workflow engine needs also to be asynchronous.  One of the \nthings I really like about accessing my bank account from the \nweb is that I get the amount in the account at this instance.\nWhen I authorize a transaction, and it returns immediately that \nit has been successful, then I know that it happened.  There is \na big difference between this and receiving the same information\nvia email even just a few minutes later.\n\nConsider a simple workflow with step1, step2, step3 & step4.  When I \ngo to interact with this workflow to tell it to go from step2 to step3\n\n* is there any reason that the workflow server can not tell me \n  immediately whether I succeeded or not?  \n* Is there any reason that the server will not know that it is \n  (or is not) in step 2?  \n* Is there any reason that it can not tell me right away that my \n  request succeeded, and that it is now in Step 3?\n* If it is not in step 2, is there any reason that it can not \n  tell me right away that my request is not possible. \n \nIn my experience, workflow systems can determine their state and\ntransition to another state in a fraction of a second, and I can\nnot imagine any reason that existing workflow systems would not be \nable to do so.\n\nThere is, however, confusion between the workflow engine changing\nstate, and other asynchronous automated activities between the \npeople interactions.  In otherwords, the SWAP interaction from \nme may put it from step 2 to step 3, but then there is an automated\nactivity that takes 3 hours to take it from step 3 to step 4.\nTaking three hours in this case does not necessitate that the\nSWAP support asynchronous interaction.  \n\n> If you can make a case for the need for Synchronous \n> communications between\n> workflow engines then please do.\n\nThe need is that by restricting the client server interaction to \nsynchronous, we end up with a much simpler protocol both from use\nas well as from implementation.  This is an important benefit of\nSWAP.\n\nWe could make it user selectable, but then the protocol could be\nselected by the user too.  Most of the requests for asynchronous \nclient/server interactions can be modeled as a more elaborate \ninternal state machine, but we should be sure that there is a\njustifiable need.\n\n-Keith\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nKeith D.

Because think of critical processes in certain\nindustry (e.g.chemical industry). Your aim is to provide secure maintenance\n\nof the system, so you support the maintenance process with workflow. Before\nyou start with the work at any part of your production place, you have to\nfulfill some prerequisites (e.g. no pressure in the system e.t.c) for \nsecurity reasons. If the acknowledge of the fulfillmemt of this is returned\nto the workflow engine, the next step, the start of the maintenance is\noffered. At the same time, an error in the prerequisites or in the planning\nof the maintenance is detected and the start-of-maintenance-step is\nsuspended. If the suspension of this step will be invoked asyncronously,\nsomebody might start with the work and security problems arise. This step\nhas to be canceled immediately an not delayed 'for better times'.\nThis example might not be the best example, but you have the need for \nsyncronisation in every workflow. An other example is an original print of \nsome document (e.g. an insurance policy) where you can have only one\n'original print'. If the print is started and at the same time there is a\nchange issued, the print action has to be suspended or the change-step has \nto be suspended, iff the print action can't be suspended.

The duration of\nthis connection can be as long as you want, within reason and\npractibility.  If the server is not available, the connection is\nrefused, and the there is no question about whether the operation was\nhandled or not.\n\nIt is my belief that in order to satisfy the need of the workflow user,\na workflow server in general needs to be able know the exact state of a\nworkflow instance at the time that a user accesses it, and needs to\nleave the user knowning exactly what state it is in after the\ninteraction.  In my experience the time needed for a workflow server to\nswitch from one well defined state to another is very small.  It is\nhighly undesirable from the human perspective to take an action and not\nknow whether your action really \"took\".  This is a long-winded way to\nsay that a workflow engine always knows its (new) state at the time that\nis returns the result of the request.\n\nWhen you say that the \"terminate\" command is asynchronous, then what\nthat means is that there is an extra intemediate state between running\nand terminated.  For example, the request to terminate command puts the\nworkflow (unambiguously) into the \"waiting for termination\" state, and\nthat some other event (possibly internal to the workflow engine) takes\nit ultimately to the \"terminated\" state.\n\nAs for clean-up, that might happen after termination, and might easily\nbe handled as a substate of the termination state (e.g.\ntermination.initial and termination.cleaned-up)\n\nIn my experience I have not seen the need to have this extra state while\nterminating a process instance.  It is worth finding out from people\nwhether they have a specific need for this intermediate state at this\ntime.  Without any evidence of a strong need, I would be inclined to\nstick with the terminate, suspend, and such commands as being\nsynchronous.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nKeith D.

They reliable store the cancellation\nmessage for later processing (or start a workflow :-)) Often you get a\nconfirmation letter as soon as the cancellation \"really\" took place\n(asynchronous response).\n\nThanks,\n\nChristoph\n\n> --------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ------------------------------------------------------\n> Dr. Christoph Bussler                                                    \n> The Boeing Company                         \n> Applied Research and Technology\n> P.O.

The events happen asynchronously (the \"actual change\nof state\") but the notification request/response is performed synchronously.\n\nAs far as resource unavailability goes, this should be handled by something\nlike TCP/IP's exponential backoff algorithm (although which algorithm should\nbe used I am not expert enough to say at this moment), rather than\nintroducing asynchronous requests and notifications into the protocol.  If\nwe reduce the both the request to change state and the notification of state\nchange to synchronous request/responses, I think we'll gain a significant\nreduction in the complexity of the workflow protocol.  I have a hunch that\nthe asynchronicities (new word?) of workflow probably demand that each\nworkflow process will handle the amount of asynchronicity in its process\ndifferently (or at least differently enough that these should not be\nenshrined in the protocol).\n\nIf SWAP handles both process state changes and process state change\nnotifications, that should (IMHO) provide the tools needed for workflow over\nTCP/IP.  What each workflow process should do when it cannot either initiate\na state change or when it receives no notification of state changes probably\ndepends on the workflow process (a travel&living expenditure approval is\ndifferent than control of a steel mill).\n\nJust my $0.02US...\n==========================================================\nMark Leighton Fisher          Thomson Consumer Electronics\nfisherm@indy.tce.com          Indianapolis, IN\n\"Browser Torture Specialist, First Class\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-9255745"}, {"subject": "RE: Issue: Synchronous vs. Asynch", "content": "> -----Original Message-----\n> From: marobertson@dstsystems.com [mailto:marobertson@dstsystems.com]\n> \n> I need some help understanding this.

You are correct in that SWAP is intended \nas a 'service' to 'service' protocol.  By 'service' here we mean\nsomething that answers a request to a Web URL.  But in an\ngiven specific interaction, one of those workflow servers is the \n\"client\" sending a request, and the other is the \"server\" which \nhandles the request and sends a response.  \n\nNow, in fact, similar to to the OMG workflow RFP, SWAP supports\nsome aspects of IF2, IF3, and IF4, but the intent is for a \npersistent service to talk to another persistent service.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nKeith D.

For example, I could list the process instances of some\nprocess definition using the LISTINSTANCES of the ProcessDefinition\nInterface, even if I did not create or start these process instances\nusing SWAP. I could then also list the properties of these instances\nusing PROPFIND of the ProcessInstance Interface.\nOn the other side, I might not want to expose information about\nprocesses that were not started using SWAP to the outside.\nI am not sure whether this can cause some practical problem.\nYou might answer \"Expose the information to the outside which you\nwant to expose\".\nA similar example is the PROPFIND of the ProcessInstance Interface.\nIt includes containees, i.e. also URLs of active activities.\nIf there are some active activities waiting, but they are not\ncontrolled via SWAP, should I return an empty list of containees?\nThis could also indicate that currently there are no active activities.\nOr should I return also URLs for these activities, enable the\nPROPFIND of these activity observes, but disable the PROPSWITCH\nand COMPLETE methods for them? (Is it viable for some resource to\nimplement only part of an interface?)\n\nIf I read the specification literally, it seems that all processes\nand activities should be SWAP-enabled, so my problems are not\naddressed in the specification.\n\n>> I see a similar problem in the PROPFIND method of the ProcessInstance\n>> interface: For the parameter \"activities\" there is an URI of\n>> the active ActivityOberserver for each open activity.\n>> The ActivityObserver Interface includes methods PROPPATCH and\n>> COMPLETE; these methods can be used to control an open activity\n>> which is listed as an URI.

The only purpose of\n>this process is to get the reference to the parent process, the\n>observer, which is an URL to the process instance on system D.

However, two things are not\ncurrently clear to me:\n\nFirstly, should we include worklist handling in release 1.0?\nI see that still quite some effort would have to be spent here,\nand you agree that it is not well documented yet. I also think\nthat if we include worklist handling, many more operations\nare needed: execute a work item, forward a work item, etc.\n\nSecondly, even with your explanation I do not yet understand the\noperational behaviour sufficiently well. Must the CREATEPROCESSINSTANCE\nmethod be invoked for each operation to be transferred from\nsystem D to system C (in your example), i.e., for 200 work items\nCREATEPROCESSINSTANCE is called 200 times?\nWhat would help is a scenario-oriented description: Starting from some\nwork items in system D, which methods must be called that they appear\nin system C, and which methods are invoked (indirectly by the user)\nin system C such that the work items are handled (in particular\nexecuted).\n\n>> 3.8 Section 5.1, method PROPFIND, parameter \"observer\":\n>> Why is this optional? Does this indicate that PROPFIND also applies\n>> to process instances that were not started using SWAP?\n>> Suggestion: Clarify, e.g. by referring to the model which is used\n>> (see also my comment 1.1).\n\n>Why not?\n\nWith \"why not\" you mean \"Why should it be not optional\"?\nIf a process has been started via SWAP, there exists some observer.\nSo the observer is obligatory, not optional.\n\n>> 4.3 Section 3.3, 2nd paragraph: \"A WorkItem, which is a\n>> ProcessInstance\": This sounds strange, having the Workflow\n>> Management Coaltion terminology in mind.\n\n>You are not the only one who has commented on this, but if you\n>think about it for a while it makes sense.

You seem like you certainly got off on the right\nfooting.  SWAP is basically a derivative of both the HTTP/1.1 and\nWebDAV protocols.  Keith Swenson's (kswenson@ms2.com) has some powerpoint slides\non Internet scale workflow to provide some examples from a talk he gave\nat the work activities conference last year.  I think the\nelectronic configuration and purchase of some number of computer systems\nis a useful example.  \n\nAlso, the approach we've been taking is  that we intend to simply use the \nApache mod_dav and extend its methods to support the new SWAP methods.  Microsoft\nalso has Web Folders for Windows 98 and 2k.  This is the sort of user interaction\nwe are imagining wrt initiating, tracking, and terminating ongoing work. \nYou might consider playing around with that.  An easier mechanism that I \ntend to use is to run an Apache server with the mod_dav plugin, telnet\nto the port (usually 80) and issue the protocol headers and statements by hand,\ntweaking the code to support the desired inputs and results.  From a philosophical\nstandpoint, there has been some discussion about whether SWAP should be a new\nprotocol or an HTTP/WebDAV derivative.  Our view is that we can justify it\nbeing a derivative, but there are both workflow & protocol developers that\ncome down on both sides of the issue.  \n\nOne other thing that needs to happen with SWAP is that someone needs to go \nand think through all the return and status codes.  This could be done simply\nby looking at the HTTP/1.1 and WebDAV status codes and then figuring out\nwhat codes would be relevant or required for workflow-like things.  As you know,\nexceptions in workflow happen quite regularly, so SWAP needs to be fairly robust\nin that area, i.e. someone has to go through and distinguish protocol type exceptions\nfrom workflow type exceptions and map them to meaningful status codes.  \n\nFinally, the WfMC interfaces are a great source for \nculling requirements.  The strategy I take is, look at their examples and figure\nout how exactly the information has to be put on the wire.   One of the problems\nwith using Web protocols for event notification is that there is no event \nbackchannel to the original callee.  One of the tricks we've been using is \njust registering\n\nSurendra Reddy has also recently presented some work on the subject, so you may \nconsider sending him email at skreddy@us.oracle.com.

Workflow systems\ntraditionally were monolithic and required the installation of client\nsoftware on the desktop. With the advent of Java, commercial software\nquickly moved towards applet-based clients and to more distributed\nsystems.\n\nMore radically, workflow systems are increasingly taking advantage of\nInternet technologies to become more open.  One example is the\nWorkflow Management Coalition (http://www.aiim.org/wfmc/mainframe.htm)\ninitiative to promote XML-based interoperability among workflow\nsystems, which builds on earlier work on the draft Simple Workflow\nAccess Protocol (SWAP) initiative.  At a higher-level of abstraction\nare efforts to develop adaptable agent-based workflow systems\n(http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~paj/ijcai-wflow-wshop/).  These efforts are\nintensifying as the coordination of work among organizations becomes\nan important component of electronic commerce\n\nWe solicit papers on workflow and process management systems that\nleverage the technologies and openness of the Internet, including\nagent-based systems.  We distinguish workflow and process management\nsystems from collaborative systems in that the latter supports the\nsharing of information whereas the former also facilitate and automate\nthe coordination and execution of processes, particularly for\nelectronic commerce.  Novel approaches, technical evaluations, and\ncase studies of commercial deployments are invited especially.\n\n-----------------------------------\n    Sr. Research Scientist\n  Stanford Center for Design Research\nhttp://cdr.stanford.edu/~petrie/bio.html\n-----------------------------------\n\n --\nSee <http://www.cs.umbc.edu/agentslist> for list info & archives.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-9679549"}, {"subject": "XML's Role in ECommerce and Enterprise Computin", "content": "The topic is \"XML's Role in E-Commerce and Enterprise Computing\"\n\nThe expert panel at XML One (Nov. 11) is avaiable for playback:\nhttp://www.technetcast.com/tnc_program.html?program_id=59\n\nPanel members:\n\nBruce Peat            XML/edi co-founder, President eProcess Solutions\nBob Bickel           Vice-President (Development), Bluestone Software\nDavid Fallside       IBM XML Strategy Group, DB2 development\nMichael Floyd       Publisher of BeyondHTML.com\nMatthew Fuchs     Architect, Commerce Business Library, CommerceOne\nSam Hamilton       XML Architect, Informix Software\nSteve Muench       XML Evangelist, architect BC4J, Oracle\nDan Rogers           BizTalk Program Manager, Microsoft\nBill Smith              OASIS President, XML Architect, Sun\n\nModerator:  Ken North\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-013-9709610"}, {"subject": "Re: SWAP Specificatio", "content": "It looks like Surendra Reddy might have left some of the links\nin mid-change.

As you know, the\nHTTP address specifies the location of a resource.  Your position on this\ndebate depends on whether you see the information being returned as 'the\nresource' or 'meta-data about the resource'.  For instance, in WebDAV the\nresource is a document of some sort.  PROPFIND gets a property of that\ndocument, but never the document itself.  When the original proposal was\nunder discussion with members of the WebDAV working group strongly suggested\ninventing new methods, especially since HTTP 1.1 defined the means to invent\nnew methods, which is why the draft defined new methods.\n\nLater, we found this to be controversial and not necessarily suited to the\ngoals of SWAP.  The technology used to implement versions of SWAP were not\nalways sufficient to allow the implementation of new methods.  The purpose\nof SWAP was to fit into the existing infrastructure, not to define a new one\nrequiring completely new implementation.  What chance is there that existing\ncompanies would be able to deploy the 'standard'?  And then, the fact that\nyou can invent new methods is no reason to acutally invent them.  But the\nreal issue is that with SWAP, the requests are dealing directly with the\nresources themselves.  Unlike WebDAV, when you get the XML representation of\na process instance, the process instance *is* the resource.  Which is why\nthe WfMC has decided it is very appropriate then to use GET and POST.\n\nI would like to see a SWAP-2 proposal put together that is consistent which\nis: the Wf-XML proposal, with extensions to fill in the missing\nfunctionality, together with the definition of how to carry this over HTTP.\n\n-Keith \n----------------------------------------------------------------\nKeith D.
