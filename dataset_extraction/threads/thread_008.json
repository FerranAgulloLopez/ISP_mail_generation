Instead of \"messages\" it would be better to talk about \n\"client/server information exchange\". A \"message\" is very ofter related \nto \"global messaging services\", which is defintly something different.\n\nThen, IMHO, the idea in general seems to me \"yet another misuse of HTTP\". \nI tend to be worried when I see the approach of using HTTP to do \nanything, and WEB browsers as a good for all application interfaces. HTTP \nil Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (with a number of syncronization and \nreiability problems we all know), and it is not the general all purpouse \ntransport protocol. It is perfectly true, Keith and Mark: it is an \napplication protocol. \n\nTha overall analysis of the requirements is fine, but conveying the idea \nthat HTTP is the solution make me strongly disagree. Internet \napplications should NOT be tied to HTTP, and should eventually use their \nown transport / application protocol, carefully desinged to fulfil the \napplication needs. Playing any possible method to force an application \nand its protocol into HTTP and a WEB browser is something we should \nsimply avoid as much as possible....\n\njust my two cents...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClaudio Allocchio             G   A   R   R          Claudio.Allocchio@garr.it\n                        Project Technical Officer\ntel: +39 040 3758523      Italian Academic and       G=Claudio; S=Allocchio;\nfax: +39 040 3758565        Research Network         P=garr; A=garr; C=it;\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-0027153"}, {"subject": "Re: Requirements for reliable message deliver", "content": "> I'm wondering if people have had a chance to look at this draft.\n> It describes a gap that probably needs filling.\n\nThe instance on HTTP is bogus.

However.\n\n1.   The assertion concerning the applicability of BEEP at the end of the \ndocument is well ... rubbish.   BEEP as a basic framework is in a much \nbetter position of providing the feature requirements described.   This is\nopinion based on implementation experience with both BEEP based protocols \nand HTTP.   Primary among these is the clear separation of framing and \ncontrol semantics from payload semantics.   BEEP is *designed* for this \ntype of semantic loading in the protocol framing itself. \n\n2.   Work in this area is already proceeding in major ways on at least \ntwo other fronts -- XML Protocol (W3C) and EBXml (oasis).   This \nproblem has been well examined, furiously debated and concensus built \n(more or less) between the two groups.  Not sure why this work needs to be\nreplicated again.\n\n3.  One of the major outcomes of the discussion (above) is that the \nbinding of reliability to a particular set of application protocol \nextensions is not a good idea.   In fact, in a true messaging sense, \nasynchronicity and store and forward situations are a reality that MUST be\ndealt with.   Asynchronous models are not dealt with at all.\n\n ***\n\nI will note that I have now seen, at least on a couple of occaisons, some \nverbage from IBM on the \"new reliable messaging standard\" that IBM will be\npromoting through the IETF.   I presume that this is one and the same.  I \nhave to say, that that presumption bothers me a bit.   \n\nCheers.\n\n---\nSteve Hole\nChief Technology Officer -  - Billing and Payment Systems\nACI Worldwide - MessagingDirect\n<mailto:Steve.Hole@MessagingDirect.com>\nPhone: 780-424-4922\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-0054334"}, {"subject": "Re: TFTP UR", "content": "--On Wednesday, 21 November, 2001 16:37 +0900 Martin Duerst\n<duerst@w3.org> wrote:\n\n> I don't have much to add here, except to very clearly point\n> out that URIs are about much more than only 'just click here'.\n\nOf course.

I think that we should have\nthem only where they are demonstrably needed and, consequently,\nworth whatever risks they imply.  Part of my problem is that the\nexistence of URIs may encourage indiscriminate use of the\nprotocols while, if someone has to go to a bit more effort, they\nmight actually _read_ the \"security consideration\" sections we\ngo to so much trouble to write.

I'll try and provide some of the background behind the\ndraft submission.\n\nFirstly, what do we mean by a message. As has been said, there are many\nuses of the term from instant messaging to EDI. The requirements we see are\nfor reliable delivery of messages as part of some distributed business\nprocessing where the guarantee of delivery is a service provided by some\nmessage oriented middleware and not the responsibility of an application.\nThe application simply assumes that the middleware will deliver the message\nto its destination and the delivery will be idempotent. At a simple level,\nthis may be the delivery of a form from a browser to a server as part o a\nbusiness to consumer service. At a most complex level, this may include\nmessages flowing between components of a distributed supply chain\nimplementation. Another example may be the reliable delivery of EDI\nmessages. An intermediate level may be the batching of messages generated\nby a complex shopping basket implemented as a multi-frame browser.\n\nAlso in this context, we see the message as being opaque. The contents of\nthe message structure should not be governed by the requirement for\nreliable delivery. As a member of the W3C XML Protocol WG and also ebXML, I\nam aware of the work going on in defining reliable protocols in those WGs.\nHowever, they assume that the message being delivered has a particular\nstructure. I have no problem with this for new compliant message sets and\napplications that may be developed in the future, but existing message\nformats such as EDI or other \"binary\" messages need to be delivered\nreliably. Therefore there is a requirement for the reliable delivery of\nopaque messages.\n\nFrom our experience with reliable transactional messaging, we believe that\na single hop approach is the starting point. Certainly end-to-end\nreliability is required at an application level, but we believe this should\nbe built on a single-hop model with multiple hops being considered as\ncascaded single hops. An important consideration here is transactionality.\nThe complexity of distributed 2 phase commit can be simplified by adopting\nthe single hop model. A unidirectional message over a single hop can be\nmanaged as a single unit of work with commit/rollback being applied when a\nmessage is reliably delivered to the endpoint. Therefore in an asynchronous\nrequest/response single hop model, there are three units of work - the\nrequest, the processing and the response. This extends to the multi hop\ncase so for N hops, there are 2N +1 units of work. Issues such as\nend-to-end security, authentication, non-repudiation etc can then be\nimplemented at the application layer on top of the messaging.\n\nA reliable messaging protocol requires the definition of \"state machines\"\nat the endpoints of the single hop together with state information\ntransferred as part of the message between the endpoints. These may be\nabstracted to a set of operations that we have briefly described in the\nrequirements document. Separation of the state machines from the state\ninformation means that alternative bindings of the state information to\ndifferent transports can be implemented. The choice of HTTP in our\nrequirements comes about from customer feedback. In spite of the\ndeficiencies of HTTP, it is the de-facto infrastructure on the Web and\nadding reliability to it is seen as important. How that is achieved and\nwhether HTTP is the only transport is another discussion.

This suggests that \nintermediate hops may be best effort if the message-passing endpoint has \nthe recovery logic.\n\n(2) Achieving reliability:  it is my view that reliability is mostly \nachieved by strong implementation and operational deployment, not protocol \ndesign.  But however good a system is, there is still a possibility of \nfailure.  I think the challenge for protocol design is to make the \nbehaviour deterministic, in the sense that the sender of a message has a \nreliable indication of the eventual outcome of message transfer (or, in a \ntransactional context, I suppose it would be better to say that the two \nendpoints have a reliable way to synchronize their record of state).\n\nI see a problem with this scenario, which I must assume you've considered, \nso I hope it will flush out any misunderstandings:\n\n      +------+     +------------+     +--------+\n      |Sender|-->--|Intermediary|-->--|Receiver|\n      +------+     +------------+     +--------+\n\n   (a) First hop:  sender hands off to intermediate.\n       On completion, assumes that delivery is (or will be) done.\n\n   (b) Intermediary falls over.  Message (or record of state) held at \nintermediary is lost.\n\n   (c) Sender and Receiver are now out of sync, with no outstanding \nunresolved state\n\n(3) You talk about transferring state information with the message;  it \nseems to me that such state information can only ever be partial with \nrespect to whatever function it is that the endpoint applications are \ntrying to perform.

My guess is that the trick to getting these accepted within \nIETF is (a) to be absolutely clear about their domain of applicability \nrather than to claim that they're fully generic, and (b) to respect \nthe limitations of other technologies - e.g. DNS, URIs fair sharing of \nbandwidth when using UDP, port #s, TLS - used by the framework.\n\nIn other words the problem might be that there's a big impedance mismatch\nbetween \"people who build applications\" and \"people who build applications\" \nbecause within the universe of applications there are vastly differing \nrequirements.  A lot of \"people who build applications\" don't realize\nthat the needs of their applications, while perhaps quite common, are \nnot necessarily representative of everyone's needs.\n\nSomeone who says \"we've got the universal application framework\" is likely\nto get shot at by folks who don't want this universal application \nframework to keep them from doing what they need to do with the Internet.\nOTOH, someone who says \"we've got a useful framework for purpose X\"\nhas a much better chance.\n\nKeith\n\n[*] of course there are things that even IP doesn't do well, so it's\nnot fully generic.  but we have to have some sense of scope. meanwhile, \nlower-layer folks are trying to make IP more flexible.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-0423250"}, {"subject": "Re: Requirements for reliable message deliver", "content": "100% support to what Keith points out!\n\nIt also explains the hidden reason behind the \"customers request\"...\n\n:-)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nClaudio Allocchio             G   A   R   R          Claudio.Allocchio@garr.it\n                        Project Technical Officer\ntel: +39 040 3758523      Italian Academic and       G=Claudio; S=Allocchio;\nfax: +39 040 3758565        Research Network         P=garr; A=garr; C=it;\n\n     PGP Key: http://security.fi.infn.it/cgi-bin/spgpk.pl?KeyId=0C5C2A09\n\nOn Mon, 26 Nov 2001, Keith Moore wrote:\n\n> > HTTP's application model is not at all restrictive.

Much/most/all\nof what is needed is already present, if people would use it.  It was\nhard to get right, but we think we did :-).  I suspect many/most people\ndon't know that those parts of the protocol exist.  Proxy servers and\ngood client caching are your friends.  This was by far the hardest\npart of the HTTP/1.1 design, trying to retrofit this into this poorly\ndesigned protocol framework.  We were able to get enough people to implement\nthis to meet IETF requirements and test it well enough we think it is correct,\nbut the \"big vendors\" have not bothered to implementit.\n\nBeyond that, if the network is really flaky beyond what TCP will tolerate,\nthe likely answer is encapsulation via a proxy pair, using a more\ntolerant to lossage transport.  This also handles the non-transparent\nnetwork case; if I can sneak the bytes through the net somehow,\nwe can make it work.\n\nI'd like to get some folks working on a good proxy server pair for this\nsort of use, as it is right up the work I'm involved in with handhelds right\nnow (see www.handhelds.org).  The network core side proxy needs to be able\nto do content conversion (rescale images for smaller screens), and the client\nside needs to work well in the face of disconnection/flakyness.

The work that you are referring to\nwas brought to the IETF as DCOM using an inefficient syntax.  It sucked,\nand the IETF shouldn't be expected to provide a forum for defining\narchitectures that are inherently bad design for the Internet.  So, that\nwork migrated to the W3C's XML protocol group.  The design still sucks,\nbut at least it is being specified within its realm of applicability.\n\nI don't know of any good application protocols that were created within\nthe IETF process -- just refined within that process.  I don't believe a\ncommittee can do good protocol design, no matter how smart the people in\nthat committee, because application protocols need to be designed to be\nefficient for one application (not all of the applications that may be\nwithin the visions of multiple engineers).  What the IETF does well is\ncritique designs and identify discrepancies between implementation and\nwhat is supposed to be a specification for interoperability.\n\nMy current protocol work is being done in private because I can't deal\nwith the cacophany of questions about \"what does this part mean\" when I\nknow the specification is incomplete.  It will only be brought to the\nIETF when I think the specification answers more questions than it raises,\nand it is at that point that people with more specialized knowledge of\nnetworking than myself can point out all of the places where I made mistakes\nor simply failed to take into account one thing or another.  That is how\nBEEP was specified, and I think that was an effective use of the process\nwithout diminishing the IETF's ability to influence the protocol.\n\n....Roy\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-0705245"}, {"subject": "Re: Requirements for reliable message deliver", "content": "> For whatever reasons, the development of these general (or domain wide) \n> protocols go on elsewhere.

They don't have a strong motivation to honor response\ncaching directives, which represent the interests of content\nproviders. Browsers have poor support for request caching directives\nor other forms of communication with intermediaries (like Warning).\n\nContent providers don't have a strong motivation to properly specify\nthe caching directives because they don't know that they'll be\nhonored or supported.\n\nAlso, allowing an unspecified heuristic to be used to determine\nfreshness leaves the door wide open for this creativity, further\nalienating content providers.\n\nCDNs are a \"solution\" for this, if the content provider is willing to\npay for the priviledge. \n\n\n> Beyond that, if the network is really flaky beyond what TCP will\n> tolerate, the likely answer is encapsulation via a proxy pair,\n> using a more tolerant to lossage transport.

The money\nis available safe with a private security company\ncoded and lodged in with a fictitious name.

Thereafter,The terms shall be re-negotiated.\n\nIf you are capable and willing to participate in this\ntransaction contact me through my email address OR by\nphone for a heart to heart discussion.\n\nNOTE, IF FOR ANY REASON YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED AT MOMENT\nTO UNDERTAKE THIS DEAL, LET ME KNOW ON TIME AS TO MAKE\nALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT.\n\nI look forward to your earliest reply through my email\nIn any case, please keep it tight secret.\n\nBest regards\nIsah Mohammed\n\n \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nFaith Hill - Exclusive Performances, Videos, & more\nfaith.yahoo.com\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-10428733"}, {"subject": "??????~ ?????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-10439207"}, {"subject": "?????????", "content": "????????????????????????????????????\n \nnet2Phone??????????:\n???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? \n????????0.32??/????????????????????????????????IP??????        \n?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? \n??????????????????????????0.35??/????????????????????????????????IP????.\nNet2phone??????????????????US$10,US$25????1US$=8RMB????????. \n \nInnomedia??????????????????:\n??Innomedia??????????????????????????????30??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????198??????????????\n??????????????????????????! ??????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????\nInnomedia??????????????????US$10,US$20????1US$=8RMB????????; ??????????????????198????????.\n\n????Web??????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????????0.33??/??????\n??????50??????100??????200??

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, I ask that you give due consideration to its importance, as we both stand to benefit immensely. Though we have not met or know each other, this is a criteria I have used to select you, as I wish to cut off all ties with my people for security and safety reasons.\n\nI am a step son and personal aide to the Late General Robert Guei of blessed memory, former President of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).\n\nYou may not be conversant with the present situation in my country, which has gradually degenerated into a civil war. On September 19, 2002, My Dad led a failed coup d'etat against President Laurent Gbagbo, in a bid to restore political stability in my country. Unfortunately, he was killed. After my Dad's death, there was confusion and power struggle in our camp; this has led to us losing half our strength. Although we still control the north and Central regions of the country. It is now a question of who will give in between us (now referred to as ?rebels?) and Gbagbo?s government. There seem to be no chance for peace, as several attempts has been botched by Gbagbo. Our Armory is seriously depleting, and we do not have the financial resources to strengthen it to prosecute the war. I have now decided to abandon the war. The US and France has since evacuated their citizens from our country. Destruction is imminent, as ECOWAS (Economy Community of West African States) has been c!\nalled in to mediate. Their only way of doing this is to bring in ECOMOG (A monitoring group). We witnessed the horror they caused trying to restore peace to Liberia and Sierra Leone during the civil war. Thus I have lost faith and hope in the struggle.\n\nTo the point, the essence of my contact with you is to seek your most needed assistance to siphon US$18,500,000 left in the bunker of my Dad?s Private Palace. Only my Dad and me knew about this fund. Now that my Dad is dead, I intend to use this money for my personal benefit (as well as yours if you accept to be my partner). I see justification in diverting the money, rather using it to support the purchase of weapons for destruction of innocent lives and properties.\n\nI secretly fled my Country, and this money was moved in cash to my present location in Europe through diplomatic means, and I have since deposited the trunk containing the funds with a private security company. If you accept to offer me your assistance, I will require that you assist me in claiming the box as a gift from me to you from the security company. Be informed that I am confiding in you by disclosing this to you, as it is only me (apparently you now) that have knowledge of this. When the trunk is claimed, we shall then have the money deposited into an Offshore account in your name, as I am being discrete of using my name for now. Then you shall have your own share withdrawn to an account of your choice, and leave the rest as fixed deposit, for release to me at the appropriate time. \n\nThe importance of prosecuting this within the next few days cannot be overlooked; hence your immediate response will be highly appreciated.\n\nOn hearing from you, I shall disclose my location to you, and discuss the share of the money you will be entitled to for offering me your most needed assistance.\n\nIn case you are not inclined to render me your assistance, endeavor to respond, so that I may move ahead.\n\nSincerely,\n\nD.

I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with \nwhose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this \nmoney when they lift it out to their europe office.\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \n\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest \nand reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every \n\nbit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as \nsoon as you read this very request.\n\nBest Regards, \n\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12204605"}, {"subject": "[????]SBSi Digital Game, Animation Center 1?? ?????? ????????#Np", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12214713"}, {"subject": "???????? ????~~~?????? ????!!!

Read this email to the end, follow the\ninstructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your\nretirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I\nknow what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these\nbefore either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25\ngoing to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing\nthis same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why\nthat day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close\nto imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.\n\nRead on.  It's true. Every word of it.

THE MORE PEOPLE\nWHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU\nWILL MAKE.\n\nThis is what one had to say:\n\n\"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but\neach time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out\nthat night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in\nthis business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.\nTwo weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars\nrolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.\nThen it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find\n$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I\njust bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so\nsmall, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.\nGive it a shot - what do you have to lose?\"\n\nPam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n==================================================\n\nAnother said:\n\n\"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never\nbelieved in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to\nwin the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I\nfelt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other\n$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions\nmeticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.\nAs soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled\nmy $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and\nthat's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already\nup $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.\nOn an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.

Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%\n(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just\nsay it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of\nthousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this\nexample, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\n\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100\npeople responded and ordered Report # 2.\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\n\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail\nsent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000\n(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\nReport # 5.\n\nTHAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million\ndollars).\n\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....\n$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\n\nREMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF\n5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if\neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails\neach or more?\n\nTHE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. VISIT CBN AT\nhttp://www.cashbynet.net/Calculator/ to\nplug in your own numbers and see the results.\n\n\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n==================================================\n\nAdvertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds\nof FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet\nwill easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly\nsuggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to\nbecome more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.\nRemember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure\nproper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.\n\n\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\n\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\n\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2\nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.\n\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,\ncontinue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.\n\n**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash\nwill continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a\ndifferent report.\n\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are\nordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER\nBATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\n=================================================\n\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF CASH BY NET:\n\nCash By Net has become a very popular business for many sole\nproprietors.

Read this email to the end, follow the\ninstructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your\nretirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I\nknow what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these\nbefore either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25\ngoing to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing\nthis same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why\nthat day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close\nto imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.\n\nRead on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical.\nNot only are you making money from your own business, you're\nhelping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.\nGive it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get\nAT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital.\n\n\nOkay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):\n\n==================================================\n\nDue to the popularity of this particular email business, and the\nbusiness potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program\nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program\nto see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.\n\nTheir findings proved that there are \"absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting\nthe participation in the program, and if people can follow a few\nsimple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only\n$25 in startup costs.\"\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE\nWHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU\nWILL MAKE.\n\nThis is what one had to say:\n\n\"I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but\neach time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out\nthat night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in\nthis business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.\nTwo weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars\nrolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.\nThen it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find\n$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I\njust bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so\nsmall, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.\nGive it a shot - what do you have to lose?\"\n\nPam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.\n==================================================\n\nAnother said:\n\n\"Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never\nbelieved in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to\nwin the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I\nfelt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other\n$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions\nmeticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.\nAs soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled\nmy $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and\nthat's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already\nup $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.\nOn an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always\nsay that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant\nto be, maybe it is for you too.

I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with \nwhose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this \nmoney when they lift it out to their europe office.\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \n\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest \nand reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every \n\nbit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as \nsoon as you read this very request.\n\nBest Regards, \n\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12352308"}, {"subject": "Audio/AMR MIME type registration", "content": "AMR is the mandatory format for voice message audio email attachments \naccording to the MMS (Multimedia Messaging System) ETSI cellular \ntelephone specification (ETSI 123 140), which incorporates the IETF MIME \nand VPIM specifications in large part.  \n\nThe MIME type registration for Audio/AMR is presently at:\n  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-avt-rtp-amr-13.txt\n\nThe AMR specification is:  3GPP TS 26.101:\n  http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_sa/tsg_sa/TSGS_06/Docs/PDF/SP-99562.pdf\n\nMy question is:  What is the difference between Audio/AMR and GSM 6.10?\nAre they the same?\n\nBest wishes,\nJames\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1235456"}, {"subject": "[????]?????? ??????~ ???? 270?? ???????? ???", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12362327"}, {"subject": "[????] ??????????????????????????????????...", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12368941"}, {"subject": "?????????????????????????????", "content": "????????????\n????\n    ??????\n??\n    ????????\"????????\"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n    ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? http://www.onway.net ??????????????????????\n    \n    ??????????????????????????????????????????CGI??PHP??MYSQL??SQL??ACCESS??ASP??JSP????\n\n????????????????????????????????????????\n\n????1??30M??????30M??????????1??????????????????????????240??/????\n????\n    2??60M??????60M??????????1??????????????????????????280??/????\n????\n    3??120M??????120M??????????1??????????????????????????330??/????\n    \n    4??200M??????????????50????????1??????????????????????????880??/????\n\n    ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n    \n    1??????????????????????Dell PowerApp??????????????????\n    \n    2??????????????????????Turbolinux??Microsoft??????????\n    \n    3????????????????SNMP????24x7x365 ??????????\n    \n    4????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n    \n    ????????????http://www.onway.net   ????email: sales@onway.net      ??????\n\n????\n    ????????????????\n\n   \n    ????????????????????????\n    ????????????????????40?? \n    ????:0592-5819328??5815780??5814120\n    ????:0592-5888462\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n????????????,??????????????????(http://www.21cmm.com)\n\n??CMM????(http://www.21cmm.com)????????????????\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12375620"}, {"subject": "[????]?????? 3003000???? ?????? 100% ???", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12383559"}, {"subject": "(????)????1???? ?????? ??~1???? ????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12390077"}, {"subject": "[????]ietfdiscuss&#64;w3.org?? ?????????? ???????? ???????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12396792"}, {"subject": "(????????)???????? ?????? ????????!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12403698"}, {"subject": "[????]??????????????10??  ????????????????  ???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12410265"}, {"subject": "?????????? ???? ?? ???????????? ^^", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12417051"}, {"subject": "(????)sky life??????????????????(9.3010.5)???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-12423612"}, {"subject": "Re: Audio/AM", "content": "I have almost convinced myself that Audio/AMR is not the same as GSM 6.10 \n-- can anyone please confirm or deny this?\n\nHere is an Audio/AMR reference implementation for x86 PCs:\n\nhttp://www.3gpp.org/ftp/tsg_sa/WG4_CODEC/AMR-Wideband/AMR-WB_Characterization_Phase/Executables/g7221%26amrnb400_exe.zip\n\nDoes anyone have source to an AMR codec?

Some of these other protocols\n      have chosen to be encapsulated entirely within HTTP, others have\n      chosen to extend HTTP in various ways, and some have used some\n      combination of these approaches.  In the course of the definition\n      of HTTP/1.1 [HTTP11], much has been learned about the backward\n      compatibility and interoperability implications of various\n      mechanisms that might be chosen for extending HTTP; the purpose of\n      this memo is to capture some of that knowlege and make it\n      available to the protocol development community.\n\n1.

For example, the text in\n13.5.1 says\n\n        * End-to-end headers, which must be transmitted to the\n        ultimate recipient of a request or response. End-to-end\n        headers in responses must be stored as part of a cache\n        entry and transmitted in any response formed from a\n        cache entry.\n\nThink of caching, for example. The client sends a set of header fields in\nthe request that it considers to be end-to-end, however, they may never\nreach the origin server because a cache happens to be the \"ultimate\nrecipient\".\n\nA difference in Mandatory is that the \"ultimate recipient\" of a declaration\ndoesn't have to be the same as for the rest of the message. But this is\nalready the case with PICS labels and authentication that also can be\nhandled by other parties than the origin server and the user agent. The\nwhole point is that it should be transparent - it is for the feature to\ndefine who the appropriate recipient is for non-hop-by-hop extensions.\n\nHowever, that being said - I don't want to upheld the draft on essentially\na question of terminology and if we can come up with another term than\nend-to-end then let's do that. Other names are welcome - or if you can\nprovide wording that makes the distinction clear. I have added this as an\nitem on the issues list.\n\n>The layered approach in 5.0 seems to imply that the last\n>step is to apply the semantics of the method without M-;\n>since that is not what is meant, the language needs to\n>be tightened to indicate that the semantics may be derived\n>from the base method, but they should not be assumed.\n\nGood point. I would be inclined to remove the point entirely as it is\nreally only the extension that can determine whether this is the right\nbehavior. Do you agree - or do you have a proposed wording? I have added\nthis as an issue.\n\n>In 3.0 the relative URIs relating to IANA don't seem to\n>match real IANA URIs (rfcs have .txt appended, for example)\n>and IANA runs several registries, so it is not clear which\n>one a specific relative URI would relate to.

Given that\n>relative URIs can only have one root here, why not just bite\n>the bullet and require full URIs?\n\nIt is important that people can use registered names without being forced\nto use full URIs. The current scheme allows us to transition from a\nunregistered name to a registered one. It doesn't matter whether IANA has\nmultiple roots. Relative URIs are really just names within the IANA URI\nspace. A clarifying paragraph could be useful in section 8. I have added\nthis as an issue.\n\n>In Section 6.0, the spec says that a host can send a resource\n>with a manadatory extension without knowing if the requesting\n>user can deal with the extension.

An \"extension required\"\n>response followed by a new request strikes me as a better bet.\n\nThey already do - servers ask you to download plug-ins, scripts etc. It\nreally depends on the ubiquity of the extension in question. If it is a\nwell-known extension saving a round trip is significant. If not then the\nextra bytes on the wire may be wasted. An extension framework has to\nsupport both.\n\n>In general, I want to acknowledge that everyone needed a\n>method to extend HTTP yesterday or the day before, and\n>to applaud all the work that has been done on it.

Rather it's the 2*DIGIT part.  You\nwould have to reserve 00, 01, 02, ..., 99 to hog the space.

Under\nmandatory, header prefixes are generated on the fly,\nso it wont know if 98- corresponds to some extension which\nit supports until it processes the Mandatory header.  This\nmeans that Mandatory headers must be processed before any\nof the two digit headers.

The proxy cache\nbehavior is defined by the proxy's need to act for the end host;\nin the presence of an end to end header in a request for which\nit has a valid entry, the proxy can still reply, on behalf of\nthe ultimate recipient.  It can't itself be the recipient of\nan end-to-end header (as an example, on a request for a resource\nwhich it has never before seen, the proxy *must* transmit all\nend to end headers to the ultimate recipient).\n\nI believe it is not a good idea to mix the terminology for headers\nintended to be consumed by some extension-defined participant\nwith that for headers which are meant for the ultimate\nrecipient, (defined either as the origin server or a proxy which\ncan act for that server by virtue of having seen the request\nand response before).  I think there should be a distinct name\nfor those headers which get passed past the first hop but may\nbe \"consumed\" prior to the end, as there are some issues specific\nto those headers (what happens if no one in the chain removes it,\nfor example).\n\n(Ted)\n>The layered approach in 5.0 seems to imply that the last\n>step is to apply the semantics of the method without M-;\n>since that is not what is meant, the language needs to\n>be tightened to indicate that the semantics may be derived\n>from the base method, but they should not be assumed.\n\n(Henrik)\nGood point. I would be inclined to remove the point entirely as it is\nreally only the extension that can determine whether this is the right\nbehavior. Do you agree - or do you have a proposed wording? I have added\nthis as an issue.\n\n(Ted, again)\nI think getting rid of it will work, and I agree only the\nextension can determine the right behavior.  Some language\nto warn people not to use M-PUT for DELETE is probably\nappropriate, but this probably isn't the right placement\nfor it.\n\n(Henrik)\nIt is important that people can use registered names without being forced\nto use full URIs. The current scheme allows us to transition from a\nunregistered name to a registered one. It doesn't matter whether IANA has\nmultiple roots. Relative URIs are really just names within the IANA URI\nspace. A clarifying paragraph could be useful in section 8. I have added\nthis as an issue.\n\n(Ted, again)\n\nMaybe instead of saying \"relative URIs\", you can use the\nterm \"IANA-registered tokens\".  You may want to think about\nwhat set of IANA registries you want though.  I assume you would\nwant MIME, registered media features (when they exist), and\npossibly registered schemas.  I believe that set would give\nyou unique names without having to mention which registry\nsomething came from, but I'm not sure that would be true across\nall IANA registries.\n\n(Ted)\n>In Section 6.0, the spec says that a host can send a resource\n>with a manadatory extension without knowing if the requesting\n>user can deal with the extension.

This is an\ninteresting idea but it does have a couple of (potentially unexpected)\nconsequences:\n\n1) It doesn't allow extending existing status codes like 206 (Partial\nContent) response code with a mandatory extension.\n\n2) A response extension may be hop-by-hop and hence removed on the way to\nthe client. The message is therefore not extended anymore and should be\ntreated as a normal message. This causes a problem in existing 1.1 proxies\nthat would remove the extension (because it is declared as a Connection\ndirective) but not change the status code so it would still say 299\nalthough the message is not extended anymore.\n\nThe question in general is what the relationship is between an extension\nand the rest of the message. As far as I can see, there are two different\npossible policies for handling an extended message:\n\na) Strip off the extension, deal with it, and treat the rest as a basic\nHTTP/1.1 message with either an already defined method or an already\ndefined status code.\n\nb) Execute the extension When processing leave the definition of what to do\nwith the message completely to the extension.\n\nThe current policy is a) - Ted had a similar note on the M- method token\nprefix, so it is obvious that the policy is not made clear. However, I\nthink that it is worth being explicit about how to handle an extended message.\n\nThis includes answering the questions:\n\ni) What happens if an application wants to introduce a new method that\ndoesn't have anything to do with existing methods?\n\nii) What happens if an application understands the extension but not the\nbase method, M-COPY, for example.\n\nI have added this as an issue.\n\n>The second and third paragraphs in section 7 really confuse me.

When resolving a resource, it simply acts as any other\nresource and if it is gone then 410 is the appropriate status code.\n\nNote that two parties may still use an extension if they both know what it\nmeans and don't have to resolve it - even after it is \"gone\".

The operation\ncan involve one or more header fields but does not have to included the\nwhole message.\n\nLooking at deployed applications and how people are using HTTP, we can't\nchange the policy now and not allow this behavior - it has been there all\nalong. The current wording in the Mandatory draft reflects this use of the\nterm end-to-end.\n\nI fail to see why you want to impose this restriction (in HTTP as well as\nin Mandatory)? I very much agree with Paul that this form for flexibility\nis crucial to HTTP.\n\n>You cannot separate an end-to-end header from the request of the\n>request (or response).\n\nThe only thing that it truly end-to-end in the sense that it must be\nperformed by the origin server is generating the initial response to a\nrequest. This response may then under certain circumstances be cached and\nreused but the first must come from the origin server.\n\nAnd even then, this is only true for responses with status codes which are\nnot explicitly defined otherwise. This is for example the case with 504\n(Gateway Timeout).\n\nHenrik\n--\nHenrik Frystyk Nielsen,\nWorld Wide Web Consortium\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Frystyk\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-12799160"}, {"subject": "Re: mandatory / extensions / options", "content": "At 15:03 3/23/98 PST, Jeffrey Mogul wrote:\n\n>    The tradeoff in Mandatory was exactly to make it very simple and\n>    very clear what it means to add an extension declaration to a\n>    message.

Later GSM 06.20\nappeared (half rate, or GSM-HR) at 5.6 kbps, and then came GSM 06.60\n(enhanced full rate, or GSM-EFR) at 12.2 kbps.\n\nFinally came GSM 06.90 (Adapative Multi-Rate, or GSM-AMR), at variable\nbitrates.  It encompasses 8 different birate modes, and some of those\nhappen to be the same codec used in other systems:\n\n    12.20 kbps (GSM-EFR codec, and also TIA TDMA-US1 enhanced codec)\n    10.20 kbps\n     7.95 kpbs\n     7.40 kbps (TIA/EIA IS-641 TDMA EFR codec)\n     6.70 kpbs (PDC-EFR, or ARIB EFR codec)\n     5.90 kbps\n     5.15 kbps\n     4.75 kpbs\n\nNote that none of these are GSM 06.10, so to answer your question,\nAudio/AMR is NOT the same as GSM 06.10.\n\nUMTS also adopted AMR as its mandatory codec set.

(In the UMTS\nset, these correspond to 3GPP TS 26.071, 26.090, 26.073, and 26.074,\nrespectively.)

If it is the consensus of\nthe group that we will not change the scoping rules in the extension\nmechanism, then I believe that removing the current text and leaving\nthe situation as it is with HTTP/1.1 is the right answer.\n\nI'm not sure, however, that leaving the scoping as it is now is the\nbest answer.  Henrik has written persuasively in previous messages\nto demonstrate that the current scoping language  doesn't reflect\nactual usage.  If that is the case, capturing that reality in appropriate\nscoping rules seems to me like a good way to promote interoperability\namong those applications which will use some scope other than\ntrue hop-by-hop or end-to-end.\n\nI'm also not sure when we will have another chance to make a change\nto the scoping rules.  It seems logical to me to say that this is a\npart of the framework needed to make HTTP truly extensible (\nthat need being demonstrated by the current use of ad hoc methods)\nand that anyone using extended HTTP had better understand the\nnew scopes.\n\nI understand that this does imply a change to HTTP/1.1 semantics.\nThe current spec already has one minor change to HTTP/1.1 semantics\n(a special case to the basic principle of unordered headers).  I would\nlike to suggest that we accept those changes as part of what is needed\nto get an extension mechanism going, rev the major number and say\nHTTP/2.0 is HTTP/1.1 + the specified extension mechanism.\n\nHenrik is right to worry about backwards compatibility issues, and\nI respect that worry.

There's a lot of interest in layering other things over HTTP,\nfor reasons including:\n\nmindshare\nfirewall/proxy/NAT compatibility\nleveraging SSL/TLS\nease of prototyping using CGI and/or client libraries\n\nHowever, several different uses of HTTP tend to pull the protocol in\nseveral different directions, and potentially use it in ways that\nconflict with one another.  For example, you don't want a request or\nresponse header used slightly differently by X-over-http than by\nY-over-http, because this might confuse proxies, or require slight\ntweaks to client libraries.  Similarly for use of HTTP error codes by\ndifferent protocols.

Today, more delpoyed proxies look\nat the method than the content-type.\nContent-Type may offer a way of filtering, Ill agree with that,\nbut to say that proxies commonly filter based on content type\nand not method isn't right.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13242469"}, {"subject": "Re: On the harm of adding new methods", "content": "I disagree with some of Larry's points.

The filtering function (or, more accurately,\nthe routing function) is based on everything in the request.  What you\nare saying is that it is better for filtering to eliminate one of the\ncriteria by which an intermediary can do filtering, in this case the\none that is easiest to find and interpret quickly in an HTTP request.\nI think that is a bad design when there are semantics that can be easily\ndistinguished via the method.\n\n>In the case of IPP, it is perfectly adequate to filter on content-type,\n>since all IPP content is carried in application/IPP.

There is nothing\nspecial about Internet printing that requires independent firewall\nsemantics.  Nothing.  A printer is a network resource that must be\nprotected like all other network resources -- as a resource.  There is\nno difference between sending a POST full of data to an HTTP server\nacting as a printer gateway and sending a POST full of data to the\nprinter directly.  Treating the two as being different violates one\nof the basic principles of the Web architecture.\n\nThat does not mean we should add a PRINT method to the protocol.\nPRINT does not say anything semantically interesting.  Why should the\nclient care what mechanism is being used behind the curtains?  Should the\nsemantics need to change if the server is actually a pipeline like\n\n     client ----  proxy  -----  fax  -----  fax  ---- printer\n\nIf you look at any modern operating system design, you will find such\ndifferences abstracted away so that every application does not need\nseparate interface protocols for every device type.  Why should the\nInternet be any different?\n\nRENDER would be a more semantically meaningful choice, since what the\nclient is saying is that it wants the service to render the data as\nspecified and then discard it.  However, the reason for defining this\nnew method has nothing to do with firewall filtering.\n\nThe IPP design is poor because it conflates an intended action with\nthe transfer syntax of the data, thus reducing the normal mechanisms of\nallowing selective access to a printer's resources using any of the\nindependently defined security mechanisms of HTTP.  While it may be\nnice to think of Internet printing as a layered protocol on top of HTTP,\nthe result is something that is neither efficient nor capable of reusing\nmany of the advantages of HTTP.  Instead, printing should have been\ndesigned as a service with a defined resource model; standard Web agents\ncould then manipulate that resource model using the same protocols\nas everyone else's resources.  For those cases where data and control\ninformation is to be sent in one action, an application-independent\ntransfer syntax should be used to group them (a la multipart/related).\nOf course, there is nothing to prevent such an implementation from\ncoexisting with IPP, so I am not suggesting that IPP be changed at this time.\n\nAttempting to isolate printer services from other services using any of\nthe options suggested (new URI scheme, separate port, new method, obscure\nmedia type) is ultimately futile.  None of these provide anything useful\nin the way of securing access to resources; the first two in particular\nare a total waste of time since the \"http\" URI scheme is port-independent.\nThe only thing you accomplish is making the implementations more complicated.\nControl of network resource access is already provided at the URI level\nand in the underlying protocol layers upon which the HTTP communication\ntakes place.\n\n ...Roy T.

Proxies will use whatever is easiest first, depending on the\nlevel of security enforced by the site.  A true firewall will look at\neverything, even though this will considerably slow processing.\n\n>>In the case of IPP, it is perfectly adequate to filter on\n>>content-type, since all IPP content is carried in application/IPP.\n\n>To which you replied\n\n>>There is nothing special about Internet printing that requires\n>>independent firewall semantics.\n\n>Since media-type is part of \"everything in the request\"... why do you refer to\n>this recommendation as \"independent firewall semantics\"? It seems valid for\n>Larry to point out that mime-type is consistent for IPP and, therefore, can be\n>considered a reliable filter.\n\nI was saying that there is no need to block IPP requests via the protocol.\n\nFor incoming requests, a firewall is going to be blocking first according\nto the resource (the URI or IP address) and, if selective access is enabled,\nthe method.\n\nFor outgoing requests, blocking via the resource is not really feasible\nunless you want to restrict access to only named portions of the Internet,\nso the request will be blocked by method or header field or content\n(in order of increasing performance cost).  But why would a firewall want\nto block an outgoing IPP request?  The only security policy that applies\nhere is that the site doesn't want the INFORMATION to go outside the\nfirewall, and it just doesn't matter what data format is being used\nto contain that information.  That is why application/ipp is useless as\na \"reliable filter\".\n\nSo, from a security standpoint this whole discussion is pointless.\n\nFrom an implementation standpoint, you want to make it easy for\napplications to understand the request quickly so that the process\nof filtering doesn't overwhelm usability.  Extracting and comparing\nthe method from an HTTP request can be done in two instructions once\nthe message beginning is found.  Extracting and comparing the media\ntype requires parsing all of the header fields, finding the one named\nContent-Type (being aware that an attacker might provide several such\nfields in the hope that the firewall would look at the first while the\napplication would look at the last), parsing that field to extract the\nmajor and minor type, and then comparing it against \"application/ipp\".\nI'm not sure exactly how many instructions that costs, but I do know\nfrom experience that it is significant.  That is why using RENDER as\na method is a better engineering choice from the standpoint of a firewall\nimplementer, since it expresses the semantics that the outgoing\nfirewall wants to block in a way that is easiest to process.\n\n>You wrap up with two additional points (paraphrased):\n\n>1. Because IPP is mapped to HTTP, it does not allow\n>   selective access to the printer's resources.\n\nNo, I said the opposite.  Because IPP is hidden within a media type,\nit is not using HTTP for anything but transport.  HTTP is not a transport\nprotocol; it is an application protocol.  The reason HTTP is allowed\nthrough firewalls is because it expresses enough of the application's\nintent that intelligent filtering is possible.  Selective access means that\nyou may not have access to POST, but you do have access to OPTIONS,\nprinter status, job queue, MTBF statistics, toner levels, etc.\nThere are many service queries that you might want an off-site person\nto investigate which do not result in printing cost, and you don't\nwant those things to be blocked at the firewall implementation.\n\n>IPP allows access to resources such as configuration or job information,\n>regardless of the protocol mapping. Is this what you are referring to?\n>What other resources of the printer do you want to access independently? Are\n>you thinking of things like firmware refresh or font libraries?\n\nI am thinking of everything that has identity on the server within\nthe printer.  A server based on a printer is no different from a server\nbased on a hard disk -- it controls access to a namespace consisting of\nidentified resources on that server (the Web's notion of a resource is\ndefined in the URI syntax draft).  Each of those resources can be\nrepresented by some media type, and therefore can be GET-able by any\nHTTP application.  If desired, you can even define a standard\nnamespace for typical printer resources, just like SNMP has a MIB.\n\n>2. Control of network resource access is already\n>   provided at the URI level and in the underlying\n>   protocol layers upon which HTTP takes place.\n\n>Right... doesn't this confirm or choice of HTTP as the initial mapping?\n\nNo.  You'd get the same from binary messages on TCP.  IPP is just an\nincredibly inefficient implementation of RPC that runs on port 80.\nA true mapping to HTTP maps the protocol user's actions to something that\ncan be expressed using HTTP semantics, thus creating a network-based API\nto printer services which can be understood by agents and intermediaries\nwithout any knowledge of printing as an application.\n\n ...Roy T.

In the Mandatory draft,\nit means \"an HTTP application that implements the Mandatory extension\nmechanism\". That may become clearer if I change the last bullet in section\n1. to say:\n\n        An HTTP application that implements the Mandatory extension\n        mechanism (an agent) declares the use of the extension by\n        referencing its URI in an extension declaration (see\n        section 3).\n\n>   2) The same section says \"Agents SHOULD NOT reuse header-prefix\n>      values in the same message.\" I can see that this was carried over\n>      from (at least) the 21 November 1997 PEP draft, but I think it\n>      needs to be \"MUST NOT\".

Take for example a\nhit-meter style extension. In mandatory this can be modelled as an optional\nend-to-end extension where caches that know about the extension may process\nit and add its result to the existing set of parameters; caches that don't\ncan safely ignore it.\n\nThis, btw, ties in to your next comment about what is end-to-end, see below.\n\n>   3) Section 4.1 \"End-to-End Extensions\" states that \"Proxies MAT act\n>      as both the initiator and the ultimate recipient of end-to-end\n>      extension declarations.\" This is another carryover from the PEP\n>      draft, but violates the normal IETF usage of \"end-to-end\".

I'm not proposing that, but I can see the logic.\n\nThe notion of end-to-end has been discussed in the HTTP WG, latest in the\nauthentication rewrite thread, I think:\n\n        http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1997q3/0181.html\n\nHere it was brought up that proxies can act on behalf of others in certain\nauthentication models. Another example is a proxy that changes the\ncontent-type on-the-fly from GIF to PNG. Hence, HTTP/1.1 already has\nexamples of this interpretation of end-to-end scope.\n\nFor Mandatory this means that the ultimate recipient of an extension may\ndiffer from the ultimate recipient of the rest of the HTTP message. In both\ncases, I think it makes sense to say that the extension indeed is received\nby the ultimate recipient.\n\nThe current solution in Mandatory of leaving it to the extension to define\nthe ultimate recipient makes the extension model a lot simpler. For that\nvery reason I am reluctant to make it explicit in the protocol. The\ncomplications of dealing with non-mandatory aware caches etc. are\nsignificant in the general case, whereas they can be defined in the special\ncase for individual extensions.\n\nAnother possibility is to let extensions use the no-transform cache-control\ndirective to indicate when a proxy can or can not process an extension:\n\n        Cache-Control: no-transform man\n\nAs this is an extended use of the no-transform, this would have to be\ndefined on a pr extension basis.\n\nOne could also imagine using the Warning header to indicate that the\nmessage carried end-to-end extensions that were dealt with along the\nmessage path. Unfortunately the Warning header has some rather strict\nrestrictions on it's use: It is a response header only and it can not\ncontain a URI to indicate which extension, we are talking about.\n\n>   4) The example in section 13.2 \"Server Uses ZipFlate Compression\n>      Extension\" is another simplified carry-over from the PEP draft,\n>      but calls out some very interesting issues that don't arise\n>      earlier in the document, at least not obviously:\n\n>         A) Man and Opt headers are general headers, not request\n>            headers.

I read the section to mean \"It would be a good idea for\nextensions to avoid choosing the same header-prefix for their headers\nas one already in use within the HTTP message.\"  Read my way, it cries\nout to be a MUST NOT, not a SHOULD NOT.  Read as you meant it, it\ndoesn't.

It goes so far as to define\nthe \"M-\" method prefix to ensure that servers that don't comply to the\ndraft will reject mandatory requests with something like a \"405 Method\nNot Allowed\" response.  But when we get to the examples, we see a case\nwhere the supposedly-mandatory header can and will be ignored by a client\nor proxy that doesn't comply.  All of a sudden, \"mandatory\" starts to\nlook like \"mandatory to compliant readers and optional to others\", which\njust doesn't sound right.\n\nRoss Patterson\nSterling Software, Inc.\nVM Software Division\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13610457"}, {"subject": "[ietf-http-ext] &lt;none&gt;", "content": "Authenticated sender is <bb5445@ix.netcom.com>\nSubject:  2 of\n\n\n\n\nEMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!\n\nBull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.\nThis program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email\naddresses.

All you need is your web browser and this program.\nOur software utilizes the latest in search technology called\n\"spidering\". By simply feeding the spider program a starting\nwebsite it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website\nto targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of\nfresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the\nspider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to\nsend format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to\nget a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!\n\nA terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is\nno difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo\nto learn.

No problem, we provide\nyou with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the\nlocation of a search engine on your browser then search for the\nmarket you wish to reach...it's that easy!\n\nFor instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors\nin New York all you would do is:\n\n1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in\nthe words doctor(s) and New York\n2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the\nhttp://...  for instance it might look like\nhttp://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York\n3) Press the START button\n\nTHAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites\nthat are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses\nyou want.\n\nThe spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all\nday or all night while you are working on important things or\njust having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a\nconstant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give\nit praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at\nthe end of the day!\n\nFeatures of the Bull's Eye Software:\n\n* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email\n  addresses you want!\n* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific\n  Countries\n* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,\n  press The Start Button, and it does the rest\n* Filters out duplicates\n* Keeps track of URLs already visited\n* Can run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week\n* Fast and Easy List Management\n* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words\n  that it \"Must\" have while searching,...you can even put in\n  criteria that it  \"Must NOT Have\"...giving you added flexibility\n* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text\n  files, binary files, database files)\n* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists\n  simultaneously\n* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people\n  who do not want to receive it\n* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet\n  with just a click of your mouse\n* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's\n  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!\n* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name\n* Advanced Operations:\n\u00b7 Email address lists export in many different formats\n  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)\n\u00b7 Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,\n  Move to Top/Bottom\n\u00b7 Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison\n* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at\n  the same time\n\nCALL FOR MORE INFORMATION   213-980-7850\nCALL FOR MORE INFORMATION   213-980-7850\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nCustomer Name\nCompany Name\nAddress\nCity\nState                       Zip\nPhone                                       Fax\nEmail Address\n\n______ BULL'S EYE SOFTWARE   $259.00\nIncludes Software, Instructions, Technical Support\n\n______ Shipping & Handling  (2-3 Day Fedex)  $10.00\n                           (Fedex Overnite) $20.00\n\n______  TOTAL\n                 (CA Residents add applicable sales tax)\n\n*All orders are for Win 95 and Win NT\n\n                *****CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED*****\n                   MASTERCARD   VISA   AMEX\n\n   PLEASE CALL 213-980-7850 to process your order\n                        9am-5pm Pacific Time\n                Checks or Money Orders send to:\n                      WorldTouch Network Inc.\n5670 Wilshire Blvd.  Suite 2170 Los Angeles, CA 90036\nPlease note:  Allow 5 business days for all checks to\nclear before order is shipped.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13618821"}, {"subject": "[ietfdiscuss] &lt;none&gt", "content": "To: President / C.E.O\n\nI have been awaiting your response to the investment issue we discussed\nregarding the floating capital.

However, I think that content-type should reflect\nthe type, not the action.  The method better expresses an action.\n\"printing\" is more of an action than a content type, IMHO.\n\nIf this was 1 year from now and all http based applications\nwere firmly in using POST, I would be more willing to 'taint'\ncontent type in that way.  However, while the cat is out\nof the bag on POST, so to speak, I dont beleive that we are\nbeyond the point of no return yet.\n\n> Point 3: `Any new (IETF) protocol should have the property that a\n> firewall will block it by default, and that explicit action is needed\n> by the firewall administrator to enable its use'.\n\n> [This point is stated most clearly in section 2:\n>   `While the designers of a new\n>    protocol may feel that their new protocol introduces no new risks,\n>    they do not have the right to decide what a PFB will support.'\n> ]\n\n> I could not disagree more.

Further, that the default action\nis that a new protocol is blocked until the admin can examine\nit and consider allowing it. Finally, these decisions to allow\nor disallow a new protocol may have less to do with security and\nmore to do with a business policy.\n\n[.. Im leaving out what you call the nitpicking :) ..]\n\nMy general opinion is that IPP (printing) is a sufficiently\ndifferent functionality set than what admins expect when they\nallow POST across their firewall.  Therefore, it isnt appropriate\nto tunnel it in POST.\n\nIf a new functionality is so different or enabled such a compelling\nset of functionality that it needs its own standard, then it surely\nis not so trivial that it is simply a \"minor variance on the current\nfunctionality of POST\".

Personally,\nI happen to agree that in the case of tunneling a protocol though HTTP it\nis at least more intuitive for the resource to be a target rather than a\nprocessor of requests\n\n---\nGregory Woodhouse\ngjw@wnetc.com    /    http://www.wnetc.com/home.html\nMay the dromedary be with you.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13761159"}, {"subject": "?? ??)?????? ???????? ???????????? ?????? ??????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1376179"}, {"subject": "OPTIONS issues from Koen", "content": "Here are some of the other issues koen had\nmentioned on OPTIONS;\n(koen, if Im missing any important ones or\n somehow misrepresenting what you said, let me know)\n\n1.

In particular, HTTP has become a popular transaction or\ntransport protocol to build on top of.  In ways similar to protocols\nbuilt upon TCP, HTTP has become quite popular at providing basic\nservices such as a framework for entity transport, authentication\n(with Basic, Digest or other),encryption (with TLS or SSL),\nProxy/Firewall Boundary (PFB) transiting as well as caching and or\nreplication.\n\n        With new protocols based on HTTP becoming increasingly\npopular, it is important to attempt to lay a framework for using HTTP\nas a common transport.  Most importantly, a clear mechanism is needed\nfor extension and higher level layer detection.  In addition, a set of\nrecommendations for using HTTP in a manner consistent with the\nsemantics and vision of the HTTP evolution group is desired to ensure\nthat new protocols built upon HTTP are to remain compatible and\nfunctional as HTTP evolves.  Finally, along with an extension\nmechanism, appropriate registries and or procedures are desired to\navoid conflicts and compatibility issues between new extensions,\nhigher level layered protocols and the HTTP evolution itself.\n\nGoals:\n Major Work Areas:\n\n HTTP Extension Mechanism:\n  1) Create and submit a new standards track draft based on either or\na combination of OPTIONS and PEP.\n  2) Create a registry for new HTTP headers and response codes\n\n HTTP Evolution and Extension recommendations\n  1) Create an FYI document expressing recommendations or guidelines\nfor using HTTP as a transport layer in new protocols\n  2) Continue work on selected functionality which was \"undocked\" from\nHTTP/1.1\n\nSpecific Work Items:\n\n HTTP Extension Mechanism:\n  * Move the current PEP draft to experimental\n  * Update and Submit draft-schulzrinne-http-status-00.txt\n\n HTTP Evolution and Extension recommendation FYI\n  * Find consensus on new method vs. existing method tunneling\n    Analyze semantics of how HTTP is used to cross firewalls.\n        <draft-cohen-http-ext-postal-00.txt>\n        <draft-debry-http-usepost-00.txt>\n\n  * Discuss issues expressed in FYI outline to find consensus on\n    recommendations.\n\n  * Move forward with HTTP Mandatory specification\n        <draft-frystyk-http-mandatory-00.txt>\n\nMilestones:\n\nMar 98          Move PEP to experimental\nMar 98          Find consensus on \"POST\" Method issue\nMar 98          Update and submit draft-schulzrinne-http-status-00.txt\nMar 98          Revised outline for recommendations FYI\nMar 98          First Draft of updated Extensions Mechanism Document\n\n[ LA IETF ]\n\nMay 98          Revised Extensions Mechanism Document\n                Submit as I-D\nMay 98          First draft of Recommendations FYI\n\nJun 98          Revised Recommendations FYI\n                Submit as I-D\n\nJul 98          Revised Extensions Document\n                Re-submit I-D revisions\nJul 98          Revised Recommendations FYI\n                Re-submit I-D revisions\n\n[ Chicago IETF Meeting ]\n\nAug 98          Last call Extensions Document\nAug 98          Last call recommendations FYI\n\nSep 98          Working group Closes\n\nInternet-Drafts:\n\n\"Assignment of Status Codes for HTTP and HTTP-Derived Protocols\"\n        draft-schulzrinne-http-status-00.txt (existing)\n\n\"Don't go Postal, an argument against overloading the HTTP POST method\"\n        <draft-cohen-http-ext-postal-00.txt>\n\n\"The Use of Post: A Response to <draft-cohen-http-postal-00.txt>\"\n        <draft-debry-http-usepost-00.txt>\n\n\"PEP - an Extension Mechanism for HTTP\"\n       <draft-ietf-http-pep-05.txt>\n\n\"Specification of HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS messages\"\n        <draft-ietf-http-options-02.txt>\n\nRequests for Comments (RFCs):\n\n        None\n\n\n---\nJosh Cohen <josh@microsoft.com>\nProgram Manager IE - Networking Protocols\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13775976"}, {"subject": "Re: http-ext charter", "content": "Excellent.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13788301"}, {"subject": "Re: OPTIONS issues from Koen", "content": "> Here are some of the other issues koen had\n> mentioned on OPTIONS;\n\n> 1.

I.e., don't try too hard to define a protocol that\nworks like\n\n        OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1\n        Host: foo.com\n\nto find out about what options foo.com supports, because this is\ntoo broad a question to be meaningfully answered.\n\nInstead, perhaps we should be happy if the client can know\nwhat options the server supports for a specific method on a\nspecific resource (or just possibly on a specific collection\nof resources, such as in DRP or WEBDAV).  While this might\nintroduce some inefficiency into the protocol (extra round\ntrips, primarily) that might be a reasonable price to pay\nfor a simple, and widely implemented, mechanism.\n\nIn draft-ietf-http-options-02.txt, back in September, we\nproposed a \"Compliance\" header that one could tack onto\nany request, so that the client could find out about the\noptions supported for any specific request (including, if\nnecessary, those supported by a CGI script used in processing\nthe request).  However, I didn't really address the issue\nof \"entire server\" vs. \"specific resource\" in that I-D.\n\nSimilarly, in the \"Mandatory\" I-D (draft-frystyk-http-mandatory-00.txt),\nwhile it may have other problems, it does follow a similar model:\nit applies to requests/responses for specific resources, rather\nthan to an entire \"server\".  (Again, this distinction is not really\nexplicitly discussed in the mandatory-00 I-D.)\n\nCan someone describe a scenario where it is essential (not\njust a performance issue, but a correctness one) to be able\nto find out what options a \"server\" (or \"proxy\") supports\nwith respect to a multiplicity of resources, rather than just\nwith respect to a single resource (and perhaps w.r.t. a specific\nmethod on that resource?)\n\nI'll certainly grant that it adds round-trips if we insist\nthat a client test options on a per-resource basis.  There\nmight be some solace in realizing that many resources are\nre-accessed by the same client, and presumably a server's\ncapabilities w.r.t. a specific resource/method pair usually\ndon't change (and so wouldn't add extra RTTs after the first\nuse).  One might also come up with relatively simple schemes\nto say \"you asked about this resource, but my answer applies\nequally to this other set of resources\".  But if the server's\nanswer *might* be different for each individual resource,\nthen I think it will be very hard to define a protocol\nthat works well when the client asks about \"*\".\n\nI.e., rather than this:\n\n  request:\n        OPTIONS \"*\" HTTP/1.1\n        host: foo.com\n\n  response:\n        HTTP/1.1 599 I have no way to answer that question generically\n\nwe could have something like this:\n\n  request:\n        GET /bar.html HTTP/1.1\n        host: foo.com\n        Compliance: RFC6789, RFC4567\n\n  response:\n        HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n        Compliance: RFC6789, RFC4567\n        Compliance-also-applies-to: url=\"*\";methods={GET,HEAD}\n\nleaving it up to the server (which knows better than the client)\nwhether it makes sense to even discuss options regarding \"*\".\n\n-Jeff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-13801026"}, {"subject": "Re: OPTIONS issues from Koen", "content": "At 11:23 3/2/98 PST, Jeffrey Mogul wrote:\n\n>Maybe the right approach is to focus on a resource-by-resource\n>basis.

For\nexample, as far as I can tell, there is absolutely no way in\nthe Mandatory for a server to declare that a particular feature\nis supported for longer than the duration of one connection.\n\nI'm not saying that the Mandatory proposal has necessarily\ntaken the wrong approach on these issues, but perhaps it would\nbe a useful excercise to at least consider Josh's request:\n\n   I do think we need to have a set of requirements or goals for\n   what we expect for extensions mechs for HTTP.\n\nbefore declaring victory.\n\n    The tradeoff in Mandatory was exactly to make it very simple and\n    very clear what it means to add an extension declaration to a\n    message.

Or do you simply\nexpect all interesting extensions to be \"specified\" in executable code?\n\n    >   feature grouping\n    >           can we group features into named sets without\n    >           getting too confused?

If we can't come up with a decent naming\nscheme.   The Mandatory draft basically punts on this\nproblem, which is fine ***as a long as someone is willing to\nsolve it***.  I.e., it's fine for the Mandatory proposal to\nignore this problem, but it's silly for the WG to ignore it.\n\n    Although this is indeed a valid concern, I don't think it is the\n    task of the extension mechanism to solve it but rather for the\n    extension designers.\n\nIf you leave the naming problem up to the individual extension\ndesigners, it won't be solved.  At the very least, as is clearly\nsuggested in draft-ietf-httpext-guidelines, someone needs to create\nan \"IANA Considerations\" section (or document) for this stuff.\nIt won't work if the only thing we say about namespace management\nis \"care should be taken.\"\n\n-Jeff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-14062340"}, {"subject": "RE: mandatory / extensions / options", "content": "thats what I thought..\n(www.lag.net is my own server)\nTrying 204.62.130.149 port 80...\nConnected to www.apache.org.\nGET http://www.apache.org/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.apache.org\n\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nDate: Mon, 23 Mar 1998 23:54:25 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3b6-dev\nConnection: close\n\n\n\n400 Bad Request\n\n<H1>Bad Request</H1>\nYour browser sent a request that\nthis server could not understand.\n\nRemote server has closed connection\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Marc Slemko [mailto:marcs@znep.com]\n> Sent: Monday, March 23, 1998 1:13 PM\n> To: Josh Cohen\n> Cc: 'ietf-http-ext@w3.org'\n> Subject: RE: mandatory / extensions / options\n\n\n> On Mon, 23 Mar 1998, Josh Cohen wrote:\n\n> > doing a\n> > GET http://www.lag.net/ HTTP/1.1\n> > host: www.lag.net\n\n> Almost certainly some configuration problem.

Extension Declarations\n       prefix          = 2*DIGIT \"-\"\n            The \"-\" is, of course, superfluous.  It simplifies coding\n            marginally.  Is that why it's there?\n\n\n       Note: In layered implementations, unknown ext-extension parameters\n       should be passed to the upper layers as they may have other mechanisms\n       of knowing the semantics of the parameters.\n\n            This is nice shorthand, but I think you owe the reader an\n            explanation of what you mean by \"layered implementation\".\n            And I, for one, am unsure which layers are \"upper\".\n\n3.1 Header Field Prefixes\n       matching are introduced by this extension instance. This allows an\n       extension instance to dynamically reserve a subspace of the header\n       space in a protocol message in order to prevent header field name\n       clashes.\n\n            Seems to me you could still have clashes if, through bad\n            fortune, two extensions happened to choose the same numeric\n            prefix.  Is this approach really better than an arbitrary\n            textual prefix?\n\n\n       \"-\". The format of the prefix using a combination of digits and the\n       dash \"-\" guarantees that no extension declaration can reserve the\n       whole header field name space.\n\n            I guess I don't follow the logic here.  Or maybe it's that I\n            don't understand how, with a different approach, some\n            extension could have reserved the whole header name space.\n\n8.

For\nexample the first one should be: \"rfc2068\";;ns = SetCookie2\n\nIt is traditional to delineate URIs with \"<\" \">\" not <\">.\n\nThere is no reason given in the draft for why parameters should be included\nin the extension declaration. It appears to be to be sufficient to just give\na list of URIs identifying various extensions along with prefixes. It is\nthen up to each of the extension definitions to define how to pass in\nparameters, if any.\n\nGiven the previous comments I think the BNF should be:\n\nMandatory = \"mandatory\" \":\" 1*Extend\nExtend = \"<\" URI \">\" [Name-Prefix]\nName-Prefix = 2*DIGIT\n\nNote that while I have removed the explicit \"-\" I support requiring that\nthere be a \"-\" in all names. So if you have: mandatory: <urn:mommy>01 means\nthat any headers associated with <urn:mommy> MUST be of the form\n01-Iamamommyheader.\n\nI also think that the draft needs some language explaining that the prefixes\nare dynamically generated, one does not associate a particular prefix with a\nparticular URI as a permanent mapping. Rather, when someone adds a mandatory\nheader they need to be required to check the current message, see what\nprefixes if any are already in use, and pick a prefix that isn't already\nused in that particular message. We really need to warn people against hard\ncoding a prefix.\n\nThe term \"end to end\" as I understand it in HTTP means client to server and\nback. Proxies can not be, by definition, a recipient of an \"end to end\"\nmessage because if they were then they are a server or a client, not a\nproxy. As such the language at the end of 4.1 should either be removed or a\nnew term introduced whose meaning in this context is clearly defined.\n\nIf we are going to have mandatory response headers then it seems to me that\nthe proper client behavior upon receiving a mandatory response it does not\nunderstand is to treat the response as a 500 response which contains no\nheaders or body. In fact we should probably introduce 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx\nresponses for use with Mandatory so that the server can choose how the\nclient will treat a mandatory response in the case that the client does not\nsupport mandatory in general or one of the mandatory extensions in\nparticular.\n\nThe second and third paragraphs in section 7 really confuse me.

What HTTP/1.1 does is allow\ncompliant applications to have highly reliable communication by providing\nsufficient controls to allow such communication to take place.\n\nIn general, it is impossible in a distributed system to ensure that\nthe other party does what it says it will do (or did).

Demanding it at the same time the action takes place just doesn't\nwork unless the right to make demands and a requirement to enforce demands\nis in the protocol being used by both parties, and that can only be true\nif both sides are obeying the protocol.\n\n....Roy\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-14323107"}, {"subject": "Re: Solution to the CGI message trap", "content": "Jeffrey Mogul wrote:\n\n>     This would be exactly my point ... if a new method is sent to a\n>     server which doesn't support the application which uses the new\n>     method, so what?

The former is a hint, the latter is a binding\nstatement. HTTP Extension Framework works the same was as authentication -\nthe client is not guaranteed success based on a hint but on what happens in\na particular HTTP transaction. Anything can happen in the intermediate time\nframe.\n\nThe current problem with CGIs is not a question of exchanging information\nabout capabilities or features, it is a question of the client not being\nable to trust that 200 OK means that the server understood the request and\nhandled the request according to the semantics specified in HTTP.\n\nIf we don't require that HTTP conforming applications behave according to\nthe spec wrt 200 OK then HTTP is not automatable. HTTP MUST be automatable\n- whether it is automated or not is not doesn't make any difference from a\ndesign perspective.\n\nDon't get me wrong, OPTIONS is nice to have, but it doesn't solve the\nproblem that the new HTTP extension framework draft does. The draft that I\njust submitted [1] uses the 102 (Extended) intermediate response and not\nthe ACK/nounce. Both mechanisms have the basic functionality needed:\n\n        * Provides \"HTTP transaction\" semantics (1 RTT)\n        * Provides once and for all a mechanism for the client\n          to make sure that the server understood the request\n          and that it can trust the response code\n\nbut in addition, the 102 (Extended) code has the following advantages:\n\n        * It is guaranteed to go away immediately and never be\n          reused (no privacy problems)\n        * It can not tempt people to use it as a cookie alternative\n        * It doesn't affect caching at all\n\nI believe these factors are crucial and besides, I am not really interested\nin experimenting with extending HTTP/1.0 applications.\n\nHenrik\n\n[1] http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/\n--\nHenrik Frystyk Nielsen,\nWorld Wide Web Consortium\nhttp://www.w3.org/People/Frystyk\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-14349948"}, {"subject": "RE: Submission of HTTP Extension Framework (Mandatory)", "content": "It is often the case that one needs to dumb down a 1.1 method to get through\na 1.0 proxy.

However, it is very specific on\nthe use of 304 and hence the rules are clear. The reason why I don't want\nto define the  semantics of what can happen with a 304 message is that\nHTTP/1.1 is and should be the authoritative on this issue.\n\n>I guess there is a common theme in my Vary and 304 comments and your\n>responses: I want things to be more obvious, and you are saying that\n>things are obvious enough already.

Anybody can\nextend HTTP/1.1 - and while doing that they may run into the problem of how\nto handle 304 messages. This is not unique to the extensions draft. The\nimportant thing to note is that the extension draft doesn't invalidate\nexisting HTTP/1.1 behavior and so if you follow HTTP/1.1 rules, you should\nbe safe.\n\n>I would be far happier if the draft dropped the examples with cachable\n>responses and replaced it with a discussion of one fail-safe method of\n>making sure that interference from caches is avoided.

Not all\nof my problems with the 01 version got resolved in this draft.  After some\ncareful reading I found that protocol elements which confused me when\nreading the 01 draft are actually just plain broken.  I have to reverse my\nearlier conclusion that the protocol is 'reasonably sound': in fact\ndraft-frystyk-http-extensions-02 has serious protocol flaws which make it\nunfit to go to proposed.\n\nOverall it looks to me like the Ext: header part of the protocol and\nthe cachability parts need more work.  The draft is also very short on\nadvice to implementers and does not have a high-level overview of\nprotocol interactions before going into specifics.\n\nBy allowing for cachable extended responses, the spec opens up a\nrather large can of worms.  Below I have identified several places\nwhere the spec does not handle these worms with sufficient care, but\nmy list is probably not complete.  In my opinion this stuff should be\nfixed by avoiding the problem all-together, i.e. by simply making all\nextended responses uncachable, and making sure that extended requests\ncan never be responded to by a plain HTTP/1.x cache.\n\nA detailed list of problems follows.\n\n- Sec 4 last para:\n\n       Optional\n       declarations MAY be applied to any HTTP message without any change to\n       existing HTTP semantics\n\nThis seems to say 'if you apply the declaration to any message, the\nHTTP semantics will not change'.  However if extension headers are\napplied to a HTTP/1.1 304 message, the message becomes an incorrect\n1.1 message which (worse) can cause all kinds of consistency problems\nin caches.  Some kind of warning that one cannot piggyback extensions\nonto 304 messages is in order, I find the spec quite misleading to\nimplementers as far as HTTP/1.1 pitfalls are concerned.\n\n- Sec 5 point 3:\n\n          3.  If 2) did not result in a 510 (Not Extended) status code, then\n              strip the \"M-\" prefix from the method name and process the\n              remainder of the request according to the semantics of the\n              extensions and of the existing HTTP method name as defined in\n              HTTP/1.1 [5] or later versions of HTTP.\n\nThis implies that a proxy which has processed an end-to-end mandatory\nextension should _not_ strip the existing Man header in the request\nwhen forwarding the request towards the origin server (when\n'processing the remainder according to the semantics of the existing\nHTTP method name as defined in HTTP/1.1').  Not stripping the header\nis of course wrong.  If the proxy adds its own M- extension to the\noutgoing request without stripping the processed Man header first,\nthis will cause the ultimate recipient of that extension to process\nthe old Man extension again.  This will have fun effects especially if\nthe extension is for a payment protocol.\n\nIn the table of section 14 it says 'may strip', which conflicts with\nthe language above, and is still wrong because it must be MUST strip.\n\n- Sec 5 point 4:\n\n              A server MUST NOT fulfill a request without\n              understanding and obeying all mandatory extension\n              declaration(s) in a request.\n\nThis implies that a request cannot contain two mandatory extensions\nwhich are to be executed by different upstream servers.  For example,\nif I want my browser to send a mandatory extension to my firewall\nproxy to enable some privacy processing, I cannot at the same time use\na browser plugin which sends a mandatory extension to trigger some\nplugin-related functionality in the origin server.  Not being able to\ncombine two extensions in this way is a rather severe restriction\nwhich kills the whole protocol for me.  It means that plugin vendors\ncannot use the protocol for fear of proxies getting in the way, and\nthat proxy vendors cannot use the protocol for fear of plugin vendors\ngetting in the way.  Result: nobody can use it.\n\nThe Ext: mechanism should be fixed to solve this problem, e.g. the\nExt: header should include the names of the extensions that were\nunderstood and obeyed by different upstream servers.\n\n\n- Sec 5 para after enumerated list:\n\n       HTTP proxies that\n       do not understand the \"M-\" method name prefix SHOULD return 501 (Not\n       Implemented) or turn themselves into a tunnel (see [5]) in which case\n       they do not take any part in the communication.\n\nThis seems to be a re-statement of a requirement that the HTTP/1.1\nspec [5] makes on plain HTTP/1.1 proxies which do not implement\nmandatory.  However, as far as I know, this is a particular\ninterpretation of [5] that is wrong: [5] does not require proxies to\nturn themselves into a tunnel, they can forward the request and cache\nthe response.  The revised 1.1 spec (draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-06)\nis a bit more clear on this.\n\nThis also has an impact on the table in section 14.\n\n- Sec 5.1 Fulfilling a Mandatory Request\n\nThere is no equivalent material on how to fulfill an optional request.\n\n- Sec 5.1\n\n       In order to avoid that the Ext header\n       field inadvertently is cached in an HTTP/1.1 cache, the response MUST\n       contain a no-cache cache-control directive.\n\nThis caching discipline is wrong for some extensions, for example\nthose which `introduce new encodings' (see introduction).  For\nexample, for an extension which has the same effect as the HTTP/1.1\naccept-encoding header, the appropriate caching discipline is\n\n request:\n  M-GET /p/q HTTP/1.1\n  Man: \"http://www.x.y/accept-encoding\"; ns=16-\n  16-accept-encoding: gzip, identity;q=0\n  ....\n\n response:\n  HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n  Ext:\n  Vary: man, 16-accept-encoding\n  Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n  Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n  Cache-Control: max-age=100000\n  16-content-encoding: gzip\n  ....\n  [gzip-encoded entity body]\n\nThere should be no 'no-cache=\"ext\"', because the extended response\nremains valid, the extension remains applied, for future matching\nrequests.  In fact if we have 'no-cache=\"ext\"', then a cache will\nrespond with the following if the above request is repeated:\n\n  HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n  Vary: man, 16-accept-encoding\n  Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n  Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n  Cache-Control: max-age=100000\n  16-content-encoding: gzip\n  ....\n  [gzip-encoded entity body]\n\nAnd this will cause the client to conclude that it is dealing with a\n'broken server [giving] the false impression that an extended request\nwas fulfilled' (first para of 5.1. At least I assume this is what the\nclient is supposed to conclude when Ext is missing. At is nowhere\nspelled out explicitly that clients should check for ext: at all!)\n\n- Sec 5.1\n\n       If the\n       response is otherwise cachable by HTTP/1.1 caches, the server SHOULD\n       include an appropriate max-age cache-control directive:\n\nThe unqualified SHOULD here is wrong.  First, servers which are not\nthe origin server often have not enough information to invent an\n`appropriate' max-age value.  Also, adding a max-age can weaken the\ncachability of the response in some cases (e.g. when it already had an\nexpires: <now>, which will lead to problems.\n\n- Sec 7\n\n       The server SHOULD send back all the information necessary for the\n       client to issue an extended request. It is outside the scope of this\n       specification to specify how the extensions inform the client.\n\nIf the spec does not specify how to fulfill a SHOULD, then no client\ncan be unconditionally compliant until some other spec specifies this.\nThis is a bit of a problem; the SHOULD should be a MAY.\n\n- Sec 9\n\n       If an extension does\n       change the default cachability of the response, the originator MUST\n       include a Cache-Control header field containing the cache directives\n       corresponding to the desired result of the extended semantics.\n\nThe above MUST hands the can of worms I talked about earlier to most\nextension implementers.  For a start, just _including_ a Cache-Control\nis not sufficient.  A Cache-Control or Expires header which is already\npresent in the response could weaken the directives in the newly\nincluded Cache-Control, leading to inappropriate caching.  This works\nboth ways: an included Cache-Control could also weaken already\nexisting directives.  So it is not that simple, one has to somehow\nmerge the directives in the old Cache-control and Expires with the new\ndirectives, to produce a set of directives which is stronger than\nboth.  This can be done, though HTTP/1.1 was not really designed to\nsupport it.  So it will be a _very_ hairy operation, especially if\nextension-directives are present.  One could of course take the\nobvious way out and put in 'Cache-control: no-store' which is the\nstrongest directive possible.\n\nFinally, if an extension does changes the default cachability of the\nresponse, it may also be necessary to reflect this by adding/updating\nVary, Expires, and Warning headers.\n\n\n- Sec 15.1, Vary example\n\nThis example was apparently adapted from an e-mail message I wrote.\nIn that message I noted that correct use of the vary header was\nslightly non-trivial.  I intended the 'transform' extension to have a\ndifferent effect on the response entity depending on which\ntransformation was used so my vary header was\n\n  Vary: man, 16-use-transform\n\nbut the vary header I see in the draft is\n\n  Vary: man\n\nwhich is *incorrect* for the extension semantics I had in mind.  The\ntext next to the example says 'varies on the request extension\ndeclaration' but what I had in mind was 'varies on the request\nextension declaration and its associated parameter in its header\nfield'.\n\n- Sec 15\n\nI have said before (in reviewing the 01 draft) that I am not that\nhappy with the caching discipline shown in the examples, but I won't\nrepeat that here because I have already said enough about caching.\n\n\nKoen.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-14547033"}, {"subject": "Re: Last Call: HTTP Extension Framework to Proposed Standard", "content": "First, I am sorry for the delay - my mailer chose to crash instead of\nsending the message so I had to reconstruct it the hard way :(\n\n>I have just finished looking at draft-frystyk-http-extensions-02.

That is, whatever is illegal in HTTP/1.1 is also illegal when\nusing HTTP extension declarations. Your 304 example is one such situation,\nanother would be to not honor the connection header field. I think listing\nthem all would be a mistake as this is essentially what HTTP/1.1 does already.\n\nHowever, I think you bring up an interesting point and that is that the\nsentence \"without any change to existing HTTP semantics\" is not clear. What\nis meant is that the recipient is free to ignore the optional extension\ndeclaration without affecting the outcome of handling the message. However,\nthis is stated just above (see section 4.0):\n\n        An optional extension declaration indicates that the ultimate\n        recipient of the extension MAY consult and adhere to the rules\n        given by the extension when processing the message, or ignore\n        the extension declaration completely.\n\nand also in section 5.1, numbered item 1):\n\n        1. Identify all mandatory extension declarations (both\n        hop-by-hop and end-to-end); the server MAY ignore optional\n        declarations without affecting the result of processing the\n        HTTP message;\n\nI therefore suggest shortening the above sentence to say\n\n        Optional declarations MAY be applied to any HTTP message if\n        appropriate.\n\n>- Sec 5 point 3:\n\n>          3.

If it doesn't, it can either return an error\nor tunnel the request in case it is not the origin server. It is not\npossible to pick a mandatory piece of the request and not another mandatory\npiece and return OK.\n\nHow to forward the request is defined by HTTP and this doesn't change in\nthis specification. Therefore, I think the text is exactly correct in that\nit doesn't make the assumption you infer, namely that the only right way is\nto strip the extension.\n\n>In the table of section 14 it says 'may strip', which conflicts with\n>the language above, and is still wrong because it must be MUST strip.\n\n>- Sec 5 point 4:\n\n>              A server MUST NOT fulfill a request without\n>              understanding and obeying all mandatory extension\n>              declaration(s) in a request.\n\n>This implies that a request cannot contain two mandatory extensions\n>which are to be executed by different upstream servers.

HTTP/1.1 has two\nscopes: hop-by-hop and anything else (which we often call \"end-to-end\"\nalthough it really depends on how you look at it). What I think you are\ntrying to do is to introduce a 3rd scope meaning some intermediary proxy\ndown the line. HTTP extensions do not attempt to change/extend the scope of\nHTTP and hence doesn't has anything to say about a 3rd scope. This is\nstated in section 4.1 and 4.2 respectively:\n\n        End-to-end declarations MUST be transmitted to the ultimate\n        recipient of the declaration.\nand\n        Hop-by-hop extension declarations are meaningful only for a\n        single HTTP connection\n\n>The Ext: mechanism should be fixed to solve this problem, e.g. the\n>Ext: header should include the names of the extensions that were\n>understood and obeyed by different upstream servers.\n\n\n>- Sec 5 para after enumerated list:\n\n>       HTTP proxies that\n>       do not understand the \"M-\" method name prefix SHOULD return 501 (Not\n>       Implemented) or turn themselves into a tunnel (see [5]) in which case\n>       they do not take any part in the communication.\n\n>This seems to be a re-statement of a requirement that the HTTP/1.1\n>spec [5] makes on plain HTTP/1.1 proxies which do not implement\n>mandatory.

For\n>example, for an extension which has the same effect as the HTTP/1.1\n>accept-encoding header, the appropriate caching discipline is\n\n> request:\n>  M-GET /p/q HTTP/1.1\n>  Man: \"http://www.x.y/accept-encoding\"; ns=16-\n>  16-accept-encoding: gzip, identity;q=0\n>  ....\n\n> response:\n>  HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n>  Ext:\n>  Vary: man, 16-accept-encoding\n>  Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n>  Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n>  Cache-Control: max-age=100000\n>  16-content-encoding: gzip\n>  ....\n>  [gzip-encoded entity body]\n\nI think you are misunderstanding a very fundamental piece of the HTTP\nextension framework: the scope of an extension declaration is the current\n*message* and not the current *request/response pair*. In your example, the\nheader field in the response:\n\n        16-content-encoding: gzip\n\nis not defined by this specification - it is undefined. If the server has\napplied a new content-encoding to the response, it must say so by adding an\nextension declaration:\n\n        HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n        Ext:\n        Vary: man, 16-accept-encoding\n        Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n        Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n        Cache-Control: max-age=100000, no-cache=\"Ext\"\n        Man: \"http://www.x.y/accept-encoding\"; ns=16\n        16-content-encoding: gzip\n\nIn this case, the Ext header field is really only an \"ACK\" that the server\nhandled the extension in the request and didn't just try to fool you. It\nshould therefore not be cached.\n\nThe scope of extension declarations is described in section 3\n\n        An extension declaration can be used to indicate that an\n        extension has been applied to a message and possibly to\n        reserve a part of the header namespace identified by a header\n        field prefix (see 3.1).\n\nand later in the same section\n\n        This specification does not define any ramifications of\n        applying an extension to a message nor whether two extensions\n        can or cannot logically coexist within the same message.\n\nand explicitly for header-prefixes in section 3.1:\n\n        All header fields in the message that match this string,\n        using string prefix-matching, belong to that extension\n        declaration. Header field prefixes allow an extension\n        declaration to dynamically reserve a subspace of the header\n        space in a protocol message in order to prevent header field\n        name clashes and to allow multiple declarations using the\n        same extension to be applied to the same message without\n        conflicting.\n\nNowhere is the term *request/response pair* (or equivalent) used. However,\nthe misunderstanding is important in itself and so I have added a sentence\nto the  2nd last paragraph of section 3:\n\n        Note, that consistency is no substitute for including an\n        extension declaration in the message: header fields with\n        header-prefix values not defined by an extension declaration\n        in the same message are not defined by this specification.\n\n>There should be no 'no-cache=\"ext\"', because the extended response\n>remains valid, the extension remains applied, for future matching\n>requests.  In fact if we have 'no-cache=\"ext\"', then a cache will\n>respond with the following if the above request is repeated:\n\n>  HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n>  Vary: man, 16-accept-encoding\n>  Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n>  Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT\n>  Cache-Control: max-age=100000\n>  16-content-encoding: gzip\n>  ....\n>  [gzip-encoded entity body]\n\n>And this will cause the client to conclude that it is dealing with a\n>'broken server [giving] the false impression that an extended request\n>was fulfilled' (first para of 5.1. At least I assume this is what the\n>client is supposed to conclude when Ext is missing. At is nowhere\n>spelled out explicitly that clients should check for ext: at all!)\n\nYou are misunderstanding HTTP here - an HTTP cache can not serve a document\nin response to a request with a method it doesn't understand. Imagine that\nyou have a new method called \"ORDER-PIZZA\". A response to this request may\nbe a pizza and a big cachable image but unless you understand the method,\nyou can't serve that image from the cache. Otherwise, the user could end up\nwith the image and not a pizza!\n\nAgain, this was discussed in [4] on the HTTP Working Group mailing list.\n\n>- Sec 5.1\n\n>       If the\n>       response is otherwise cachable by HTTP/1.1 caches, the server SHOULD\n>       include an appropriate max-age cache-control directive:\n\n>The unqualified SHOULD here is wrong.  First, servers which are not\n>the origin server often have not enough information to invent an\n>`appropriate' max-age value.  Also, adding a max-age can weaken the\n>cachability of the response in some cases (e.g. when it already had an\n>expires: <now>, which will lead to problems.\n\nThe max-age cache-control directive always takes precedence over the (old)\nExpires header field so this wouldn't cause any conflicts. In fact, the\nexamples in the document use both in order to allow HTTP/1.1 to do more\nadvanced caching than HTTP/1.0 caches.\n\nThat being said, I think that MAY is sufficient in this contest, especially\nas you say, it is difficult to dream up an appropriate value.\n\n>- Sec 7\n\n>       The server SHOULD send back all the information necessary for the\n>       client to issue an extended request. It is outside the scope of this\n>       specification to specify how the extensions inform the client.\n\n>If the spec does not specify how to fulfill a SHOULD, then no client\n>can be unconditionally compliant until some other spec specifies this.\n>This is a bit of a problem; the SHOULD should be a MAY.\n\nNo, it is not a MAY - in fact it is a lowercase should.\n\n>- Sec 9\n\n>       If an extension does\n>       change the default cachability of the response, the originator MUST\n>       include a Cache-Control header field containing the cache directives\n>       corresponding to the desired result of the extended semantics.\n\n>The above MUST hands the can of worms I talked about earlier to most\n>extension implementers.  For a start, just _including_ a Cache-Control\n>is not sufficient.  A Cache-Control or Expires header which is already\n>present in the response could weaken the directives in the newly\n>included Cache-Control, leading to inappropriate caching.  This works\n>both ways: an included Cache-Control could also weaken already\n>existing directives.  So it is not that simple, one has to somehow\n>merge the directives in the old Cache-control and Expires with the new\n>directives, to produce a set of directives which is stronger than\n>both.  This can be done, though HTTP/1.1 was not really designed to\n>support it.  So it will be a _very_ hairy operation, especially if\n>extension-directives are present.  One could of course take the\n>obvious way out and put in 'Cache-control: no-store' which is the\n>strongest directive possible.\n\nFirst, your comments are more intended for the complexity of HTTP/1.1 than\nof the extension framework: yes, cache-control and vary header fields can\nbe hard to deal with.\n\nSecond, you are assuming that the new combined cache-control must be\nstronger than what it replaces. This doesn't have to be the case.\n\nThird, the word \"include\" refers to what goes into the forwarded message.\nThat is, it has already been merged with whatever was already there in the\nmessage being forwarded.\n\nForth, I don't understand why you say that \"no-store\" in the obvious\nsolution. There is no obvious solution as it depends on the extension and\nhow it is being used.\n\nFifth, where does it say that HTTP/1.1 wasn't designed to deal with this?\nNowhere!\n\n>Finally, if an extension does changes the default cachability of the\n>response, it may also be necessary to reflect this by adding/updating\n>Vary, Expires, and Warning headers.\n\nGood point - we should add a sentence to that effect:\n\n        The originator MAY also use the Vary and the Expires header\n        fields if appropriate.\n\n>- Sec 15.1, Vary example\n\n>This example was apparently adapted from an e-mail message I wrote.\n>In that message I noted that correct use of the vary header was\n>slightly non-trivial.  I intended the 'transform' extension to have a\n>different effect on the response entity depending on which\n>transformation was used so my vary header was\n\n>  Vary: man, 16-use-transform\n\n>but the vary header I see in the draft is\n\n>  Vary: man\n\n>which is *incorrect* for the extension semantics I had in mind.  The\n>text next to the example says 'varies on the request extension\n>declaration' but what I had in mind was 'varies on the request\n>extension declaration and its associated parameter in its header\n>field'.\n\nI can't comment on that the example is different from what you expected and\nthat this makes it incorrect in your eyes. It is not incorrect. I didn't\nuse your example (although correct) because I don't want to give the\nimpression that header-prefix'ed header fields are defined without an\nextension declaration - they are not.\n\n>- Sec 15\n\n>I have said before (in reviewing the 01 draft) that I am not that\n>happy with the caching discipline shown in the examples, but I won't\n>repeat that here because I have already said enough about caching.\n\nThanks for your comments - I hope my answers clarify your questions.

I can tell you that correctness was a\nmajor goal and that you are breaking it in several places.  You have a\nchoice between two options: either you specify a correct and simple\ncaching discipline, or you do a lot of more work and specify a correct\nand subtle one with slightly better performance.  The discipline you\nspecify now is incorrect: it does not contain the necessary elements\nneeded if independently developed extensions are to reconcile their\ncaching needs without error, and it specifies some other necessary\nelements a wrong or overly simplistic way (like the 'include a\nCache-Control' in section 9).  This incorrect discipline will lead to\nall kinds of breakage and is therefore simply unacceptable.\n\nIf you don't believe things will break then try some implementation\nexperiments with multiple mandatory extensions in several cascaded\nproxies, with all these extensions attaching some dynamic information\nto the response which will become stale at different rates.  Oh yes,\nthe exact nature of the information added depends of course on the\nparameter headers sent with the extension requests, and the origin\nserver which you are contacting contains resources which require\ndifferent caching disciplines, with some of the resources being\naccessible only if a payment extension is used.  Your user agent sends\na request with an if-none-match header whenever it revalidates a stale\nresponse.  The proxy chain contains some plain 1.1 proxies too, and\nyou try adding some 1.0 ones if you feel lucky.\n\nYou can look at protocol extensions like RFC2227 and RFC2295 to find\nsome of the things which are needed to safely extend HTTP if caching\ngets involved.  Your job is even bigger because you are writing a\nmeta-protocol to co-ordinate unspecified extensions!\n\n\n[...]\n>>- Sec 5 point 3:\n>>\n>>          3.

Since there are a number of things that\nwould like to use it and go to standards-track, we are trying to get\nthat changed.\n\nMy own personal take on the situation is that there is resistance to\nanything that encourages more protocols to extend or layer on HTTP\nbecause that is viewed as a problem.  In some ways, I actually share\nthis view, but I also think that since it will happen anyway we should\nat least provide some guidance on the less-bad ways to do it.\n\n[in the interest of reducing duplicates, and because this is about the\nstatus and not the protocol, I've directed replies only to\ndiscuss@apps.ietf.org]\n\n--\nScott Lawrence           Director of R & D        <lawrence@agranat.com>\nAgranat Systems, Inc.

It is being \ntaught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the \nWall Street Journal have stated that between 50\\% and 65\\% of all goods and \nservices will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990's. \n\n\nThis is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 3,500,000 millionaires \nin the WORLD, 20\\% ( 700,000) made their fortune in the last several years \nin MLM. Moreover, statistics show that over 100 people become millionaires \neveryday through Multi-Level Marketing. \n\nYou may have heard this story before, but over the summer Donald Trump (A \nMULTI-BILLIONAIRE, ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD) made an \nappearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if \nhe lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating, \nTrump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. \nThe audience started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and \ndead-panned his response \"That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all \nsitting out there!\" \n\nWith network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions \nfrom sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you \nintroduce to the business. \n\nResidual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time or \nmoney once and getting paid again and again and again. In network \nmarketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others. \n\nThis program is currently being utilized in more than 50 different \ncountries across the world. \n\nThe enclosed INF0RMATION is something I almost let slip through my fingers. \nFortunately, sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and \nstudy to it. \n\nMy name is Johnathon Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for \nthe past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated. After \nunproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the \npast year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, \nfriends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my \nbusiness and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and \nborrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT \nTHAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to \nshare the experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER \nFINANCIALLY!!! \n\nIn mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to \nreceiving this program I had been sending away for INF0RMATION on various \nbusiness opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were \nnot cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or \nthe initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would \nwork or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one \nyear...it didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! \n\nBut like I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this program. I \ndidn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing \nlist. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make \nsure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a \nMONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start, \nwithout putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and \nfigured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I \nwas still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects \nof it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 \n24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the \nprogram was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\" \n\nInitially I sent out 100,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time \non-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for \nprinting to send out the program, and because all of my orders are \nfulfilled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it \nis, I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not \n\"rip-off\" anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. \n\nIn less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. By \nJanuary 13, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. Your goal is to \n\"RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF YOU DON'T, \nSEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!\" My first step in making $46,000 in 90 \ndays was done. \n\n\nBy January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. Your goal is to \n\"RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND \nOUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, \nRELAX, YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $46,000 GOAL.\" Well, I had 196 orders for \nREPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. \n\n\nBy March 1, of my e-mailing of 100,000, I received $42,000 with more coming \nin every day. \n\nI paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time \nto read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!!! Remember, \nit won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must \nfollow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in \na different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In \norder for this program to work, you must meet your goal of 20+ orders for \nREPORT #1, and 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $46,000 or more \nin 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! \n\nIf you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is \na great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to \nparticipate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial \nsecurity. \n\nIf you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like I was, \nor you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! \n\nSincerely, \n\nJohnathon Rourke \n\n\nFollow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It \nworks exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this \nexciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send \nthis to may send out 100,000 or more...and your name will be on everyone of \nthem! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers \nyou will reach. \n\nSo my friend, I have given you the ideas, INF0RMATION, materials and \nopportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! \n\n\"THINK ABOUT IT\" \n\n\nBefore you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a \nlittle time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure \nout what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible \nresponse and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make lot of \nmoney! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have \nwill vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! \nJody Jacobs, Richmond, VA \n\nHERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ \n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n\nThis method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that \nyou could use up to $46,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say \n\"BULL... \", please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, \nbut a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you \ndo: \n\nAs with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new \npartners and selling our products. Because of the global nature of the \ninternet, you will be able to recruit new multi-level business partners \nfrom all over the world, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR \nORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in \npersonal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store or office. \nThis is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere. \n\nThis is what you MUST do: \n\n1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below \n(you can't sell them if you don't order them). \n\na. For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU \nARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case \nof a problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the \nreport. \nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL \nPROBLEMS! \n\nb. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. \nYou will need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer \nand resell them. \n\nc. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five \nreports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to \nsend to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. \n\n2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to \neach report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is \ninstructed below in steps \"a\" through \"g\" or you will lose out on the \nmajority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you'll \nalso see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has \nbeen tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. \n\na. Look below for the listing of available reports. \n\nb. After you've ordered the five reports, take this advertisement and \nREM0VE the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it \nthrough the cycle and is no doubt counting their $46,000! Also, change the \nname of the company, the address, and the REM0VE e-mail address on the top \nof this document to your own. \n\nc. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. \n\nd. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. \n\ne. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3. \n\nf. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. \n\ng. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. \n\nPlease make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! \n\n3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save \nit to your computer. Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this \nletter. \n\nYour cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can \nafford $25). You obviously already have an Internet connection and e-mail \nis FREE! \n\nTo assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports \nyou purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing INF0RMATION which \nincludes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free \nclassified ads and much, much more. \n\nIn addition you will be provided with INF0MATION on Internet Marketing \nClubs such as INTERNET MARKETING RESOURCES(IMR): This is one the premiere \ninternet marketing clubs on the INTERNET. This club provides a forum where \ninternet marketers from all over the world can exchange ideas and secrets \non Internet Marketing. In addition, members of this club are provided free \ninternet marketing tools and services for the Do-Yourself-Internet-Marketer. \n\nThey will provide you with free bulk e-mail software and up to 1,000,000 \nfresh e-mail addresses each week. This club will provide you with hundreds \nof free resources which include: How to obtain free web sites, how to \nobtain top rankings in search engines for your web-site, how to send bulk \ne-mail into AOL and Compuserve, how to market your products on newsgroups, \nfree classified ads, electronic malls, bulletin boards, banner ads and much \nmore. \n\nThere are two primary methods of building your downline: \n\nMETHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL \n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and \nwe'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. \nLet's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.3\\% response. Using a good \nlist the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out \nhundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with \nthis example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.3\\% response, that \nis only 6 orders for REPORT #1. Those 6 people respond by sending out 2,000 \nprograms each for a total of 12,000. Out of those 0.3\\%, 36 people respond \nand order REPORT #2. Those 36 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of \n72,000. The 0.3\\% response to that is 216 orders for REPORT #3. Those 216 \nsend out 2,000 programs each for a 432,000 total. The 0.3\\% response to that \nis 1,296 orders for REPORT #4. Those 1,296 send out 2,000 programs each for \na 2,592,000 total. The 0.3\\% response to that is 7,776 orders for REPORT #5. \n\n\nThat's 7,776 $5 bills for you, CASH!!! Your total income in this example is \n$30 + $180 + $1,080+ $6,480 + $38,880 for a total of $46,650!!! \n\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,994 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO \nWILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A \nMOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS \nINSTEAD OF 2,000. \nBelieve me, many people will do just that, and more! By the way, your cost \nto participate in this is practically nothing. You obviously already have \nan internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! \n\nREPORT #2 and #5 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing, tell you \nwhere to obtain free bulk e-mail software and where to obtain e-mail lists \nand show you how to send out 1,000,000 e-mails for free. \n\nMETHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \n\n1. Advertising on the 'Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are \nHUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small \njust to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 6 people to \nparticipate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet \nwill EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR \nORGANIZATION gets ONLY 6 downline members. Follow this example to achieve \nthe STAGGERING results below. \n\n1st level--your 6 members with $5 ($5 x 6)........................$30 \n2nd level--6 members from those 6 ($5 x 36)....................$180 \n3rd level--6 members from those 36 ($5 x 216)............ $1,080 \n4th level--6 members from those 216 ($5 x 1,296)....... $6,480 \n5th level-6 members from those 1,296 ($5 x 7,776)... $38,880 \n...............................................$46,650 \n_________________________________________________________________________ \n\n\nRemember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit \n6 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people \nto participate! Many people will get 100's of participants! \nTHINK ABOUT IT! \n\nFor every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they \nordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This \nwill guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, with YOUR name and address on \nit, will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the \nreport! \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n\nAVAILABLE REPORTS \n_________________________________________________________________________ \n*** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME *** \n\nNotes: \n\nALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT \nCHECKS NOT ACCEPTED \nALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL \nMake sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of \npaper. On one of those sheets of paper, include: \n\n(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering\n(b) your e-mail address (So your report can come by email)\n(c) your name & postal address.\n\n\n**** Place your name in the 1st report.

Then, a couple of weeks later \nyou should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue \nadvertising or sending e-mails until you do. \n\nOnce you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, \nbecause the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue \nto roll in! \n\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: \n\nEvery time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of \na DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which \nreport people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, \nsend another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole \nprocess again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from this \nbusiness! \n\n\n\nBefore you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this \nprogram. Please answer one question. DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If \nthe answer is yes, please look at the following facts about this \nprogram: \n\n1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT \nCOST ANYTHING TO PRODUCE! \n\n2.

YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR \nINITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS YOUR TIME! \n\n6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE \nFROM THIS PROGRAM IS PURE PROFIT! \n\n\n******* T E S T I M O N I A L S ******* \n\nThis program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule \nof not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and \nyou'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It \nreally is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little \ncost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, \nand you'll be on your way to financial security. \nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand \n\nMy name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost \naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When \nI received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \"junk mail.\" I \nmade fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and \npercentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my \nsupposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of \nher, and was ready to lay the old \"I told you so\" on her when the thing \ndidn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received \nover 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 \nbills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it \nwouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her \"hobby.\" I \ndid have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the \"rat race\" \nand it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. \nMitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL \n\nThe main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is \nhonest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of \nmoney in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this \nout. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal \neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the \nfirst 14 weeks, with money still coming in. \nSincerely yours, \nPam Hedland Halmstad, Sweden \n\nNot being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to \nparticipate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the \ninitial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't \nget enough orders to at least get my money back. I surprised when I found \nmy medium-size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so \noverloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make \nmore money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing \nabout this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply \nisn't a better investment with a faster return. \nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \n\nI had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I \nshouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to \nget another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program, \n11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more \nthan $41,000 on the first try!! \nMohamed, Cairo, Egypt \n\nThis is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, \nand will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our \nmoney. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do \nit. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden \nopportunity. \nGood luck and happy spending! \nSam Lee Suva, Fiji Islands \n\n\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO FINANCIAL \nFREEDOM! \n\nNOW IS THE TIME FOR YOUR TURN \n\nDECISIVE ACTION YIELDS POWERFUL RESULTS \n\n_________________________________________________________________________ \n\nPLEASE NOTE: If you need help with starting a business, registering a \nbusiness name, learning how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local \noffice of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) \n1-(800)827-5722 for free help and answers to questions.

I am an\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk\nmail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the\npopulation and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\nwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\n''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was\n\non me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days\nshe had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I\nhave joined Jody in her ''hobby''.\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\n======================================================\n''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided\nthat the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\nwouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't\na better investment with a faster return and so big.\"\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\n=======================================================\n''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered\nif I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact\nto get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\nelse.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not\ndelete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\n=======================================================\n''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with\nlittle cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and\nwithin 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made\n$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was\n$362,840.00.

Shows improvement vs. even a highly-optimized http/1.1\nengine.\n\nMike Spreitzer presented the draft motivation/charter/plan:\ndraft-frystyk-httpng-overview-00.txt.\n\n\"spurious diversity\" amongst all the various extensions of http projects\n@@hey, isnt' DARPA paying good money for \"artificial diversity\" these days?\n\nModularity, in this case, is factoring into three layers: transport,\ninvocation, document exchange.\n\nHenrik: there are two dimensions of modularity: layering (extensions at a\nhigh semnatic abstraction still have to worry about bits on wires) and\ninteraction between extensions (arbitration between potentially conflicting\nmodules).\n\nGettys: even as simple as end-of-message: there are four or five varying\ntechniques in HTTP/1.1 alone.\n\nHenrik:https:// is an example of layering failure. Just adding security now\nrequired changing entire namespaces w/o an upgrading facility.\n\nMike is considering separating layer 2 into an invocation control and\nparameter-passing subparts.\n\nTransition: unlike IPv6, it should/can be deployed link-by-link rather than\ne2e. So adoption scenarios might be client-cache or wan-cache pairs or so\non. Performance as the relative incentive to install these pairs, initially.\nEvolution, later: making it easier to churn out new protocols\n\n@@by analogy to how XML cleans up SGML to make it easier to churn out new\ntagsets\n\nAllaire's XML-over-HTTP code tree will go open source tomorrow. Jim called\nit a \"train wreck\": makes it impossible to allow firewalls to read inside\nenvelopes. Hallam-Baker: train-wrecks are good things, motivating change.\n\nOf course, transparent replacement of HTTP/1.1 is a GWS (goes without\nsaying).\n\nTransition also needs metadata about servers' version level from DNS or so.\n\nJim Gettys presented the charter overview. The app and tsv ADs jointly\ndecided this should be in Transport (under Vern Paxson). Proposed chair: JG.\n\nWhich of the three layers provides security? any? all?\n\nThe lower layers are more \"baked\".\n\nOpen question: timelines and action items and milestones.\n\nDeliberately Excluded: language mappings, remote-invocation layer APIs, any\nenhancement of Web semantics, replacing TCP.\n\nPresented an 18-month plan. Yaron: \"triple it\". Huitema commented \"either\nits possible in 6 months or it's not\"  Touch: \"where's minimalism, 'don't\nput it in if you don't need it'\". Mike: \"of course, there has to be\nconservatism to succeed\".  Huitema: \"either you have a solution or a warplan\n-- committee hacking?\"\n\nHenrik: HTTP/1.1 is getting more complex all the time, and the interactions\nare growing exponentially. We need to start over with something that will be\nsimpler at the lower layers.\n\nJim: the alternative -- today -- is very complicated indeed.\n\nJoe: work the goal \"keep it simple\" into the charter. True, it's \"apple\npie\", but say it anyway.\n\nLawrence: the new version of this document has been genericized to the point\nthat everyone can agree with it without neccessarily agreeing with anyone\nelse. As a rationale for chartering a WG, it's lack of concreteness and\ntestable assertions is a weakness.\n\nMike: we had a more specific document, a very specific charter that was\nthrown back at us. We wrote it to be \"specifically vague\"\n\nHardie: something was lost in the round-trip, such as Janssen's design\nprinciples. One was \"generic platform for services\". The logic seems to go,\npeople are tunnelling and layering every damn thing you can think of onto\nHTTP, so let's design something explicitly designed for tunnelling and\nlayering every damn thing you can think of.\n\nHenrik: you can't start off a working group debating the problem itself...\n\nYaron: I object to using HTTP in the name. It looks much more like lessons\nlearned from HTTP, but it's not an evolutionary descendant. Second, there's\na shooting war in D-O standards marketplace, and IETF should stay out at\nrisk of its own credibility. Instead allow more time for 1.1 to be deployed,\nget experience with IPP, DAV, etc; and let the wars settle out.\n\nMike: in fact, their war is elsewhere; we've been talking to some of them\nabout providing the wire protocol. They're worried about the APIs.\n\nPhill: If the goal is to provide another resolution service for http://\nurls, then this IS the natural successor transport and SHOULD be called\nHTTP-NG. It's a massive installed base. Too many WGs are reinventing HTTP as\nit is. If not one, we'll have fifty.\n\nScott: I'd prefer fifty :-) First, there has been a great deal of private\nW3C discussion, but the public list is quiescent [it's now considered the\nmain list]. Second, the charter is pretty broad. The separation in three is\ngood, though I disagree significantly with the third. Negotiable muxing of\nstacks is a great idea. Out-of-order responses would be great.\nCompact-encoding is great -- but switchin got an object framework seems, to\nme, to be neither necessary nor the most effective. Just re-encoding\nHTTP/1.1 would be a trivial, effective, and useful exercise that we should\nall do. Finally, the charter doesn't exclude things which could slow it down\nto 4+ years. Saying it's a full DO system and narrowing it to support TCWA\nonly invites \"experts.\" Split into subgroups... Jim: ADs discouraged that.\nVern: I'm finding this discussion very helpful...\n\nEliot (? AAA bof leader): After bashing out a requirements draft, the\ncharter may have to be re-bashed. Second, enough work has been done to avoid\nbeing remanded to IRTF\n\nMark Day: take away the letters HTTP and convince me you're still part of\nthe solution.\n\nMike: we need to reduce the number of these things. We want one thing, which\nreplaces HTTP. Realign the Web application in this direction, and everything\nelse will follow.\n\nJim: if we can even develop recyclable parts from this effort, it will have\nbeen worthwhile\n\nBlack WOMAD shirt: I'm worried there's running code. Even a prototype ends\nup constraining the requirement space.\n\nMike: \"I was not under the impression that the WG would see my code and roll\nover\" :-)\n\nJim: I am very tired of several years' worth of arguments with no data. I\ninsist on data.\n\n[It's not just Mike's code alone, of course]\n\nJim Whitehead: By focusing on just what the Web currently does, you could be\nrisking a second system effect. I want to ask \"Where's the Hypertext\"? There\nare lots of ideas in the HT community that are not reflected in the charter\nGettys: and deliberately so! JW: I'd at least like to see TCWA spun out, to\nreach beyond the classic apps, IPP, WebDAV, RDF metadata for links,\nalternative name resolution, caching, etc. Further out, I'd like to see some\neconomics: integrating payment and security.\n\n[Note that a DAV-NG prototype was discussed by PARC in Chicago]\n\nMike: we were nervous about calling out a set of applications, because they\ndon't form success criteria. All the current IETF HTTP derivatives are on\nour radar; are in that set. But, App area is unenthusiastic about chartering\na new Web group\n\nRohit: well, several startup companies have been focused on 'fast http\nlinks' by cutting all kinds of corners and still haven't produced dramatic\nresults -- what have they said during the W3C gestation of this project? A:\nnone\n\nScott: the secret of the Web is its anarchism. The loose coupling between\ndata and serving process is extremely valuable.\n\nHenrik: lots of new restrictions on caches, rights mgmt, payment, etc. And\nif they're not going through extensible proxy caches, they'll be\nshort-circuited.\n\nScott: the notion that creating a better application framework will convert\npeople from hiding their application data in an opaque media type is to get\nthrough firewalls. What you're doing, quite correctly, makes it easier to\nwrite more intelligent firewalls, but app developers will still hide out at\nthe highest layer.\n\nMike: distinguish between extensions of HTTP and of HTML. I see a lot of\ninterest in a \"pun\". forms, which are simultaneouly an API and an interface.\nBut that's not the end-all.\n\nCarl-Uno: your factoring is a fine idea. IPP would be interested in the two\nlower layers (Transport, to me). But the continuation of the HTTP is an\nApplications area project, in parallel with close interaction. If you think\nit's going to take 1.5 yrs, it'll be 3, but if you split it, maybe 2.\n\nJoe: put that performance chart back up... it's only a 5-10% performance\ndifference. The big gain was from HTTP/1.0 to totally optimized HTTP/1.1.\nShow me 20-30-40% Gettys: cache-validation is already 4x faster Scott: but\nwhat if you just abbreviated 1.1 messages Gettys: that would be another\nvalid approach. That knocked out the 1) perf argument 2) the generic app\nargument 3) tweak HTTP. You can't prevent programmers from 2), so you're\neither left with 3a) a 6-month 1.2 version, or 3b) an IRTF project to\nreinvent the Web.\n\nHenrik: people aren't evil, they just can't see how to do it easily\nJoe: so write a book instead :-)\nHenrik: you can't do it in 1.1: there's too many dependencies.\nJoe: and how will modularizing it solve the problem?\nHenrik: the interactions don't get simpler, but the 'vertical' ones will\n\nGreg Callahan (NFS4 on ONC RPC group chair): the transport area already has\na single RPC layer project: why not use the ONC? Mike: our prototype does\nuse ONC+XDR, with slight extensions.\n\nMike: one clear difference is that ONC doesn't have objects at all. Huitema:\ngood! it's simple enough it's picked up on an application-by-application\nbasis. Mike: then why isn't it used for Internet-wide use? We belive there\nare fixable insufficiencies in existing solutions just as we found with Web\nover ILU a long time. We want to smooth out the warts that make it\ninadvisable for Internet-scale use. Huitema: then why not call it the\nInternet RPC WG? Mike: because you need to limit the scope to the Web to\nremove some complexity. Scott: that's no real limitation; you track every\nnew application of the Web and you never close.\n\nYaron: note that the lower you go on the stack the more excited people are\nhere. I'd love to MUX straight HTTP/1.1. How about a group whose sole job\nwas muxing, properly chartered in Transport. And THEN, open a new WG, and so\non.\n\nJosh: \"if they're trying to do HTTP then why are they doing a DO system?\" is\na fair charge. But it shouldn't be named HTTP. I also don't agree there's a\nterrible problem which merits rebuilding from scratch. You've said the\nfatals are lack of caching, error code limits, yada, yada, but they each\nseem fixable in increments. Why not patch ONC, or patch HTTP? The work\neffort needs to modularize.\n\nHuitema: the basis of your argument is that HTTP has been polluted by people\nusing to all sorts of things. That's a fact of life. Our first Bellcore\nvoicemail over ethernet in 1983 used FTP? In the late 80s, it was 822. Reuse\nsomeone else's infrastructure until you have critical mass to become your\nown application. It's like if I wanted to change email to make it easier to\ndo transactions back then...\n\nMike: resolved, people think the factoring is good; MUX has strong support.\n\nYaron: \"It's the MUX stupid!\"\n\nJim: I sense that we should 1) work on MUX and 2) and make requirements on\nHTTP-NG. No opinion on whether it's one group or two.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15219523"}, {"subject": "Re: ORLANDO BOF MINUTES", "content": "Funny ideas:\n\n-If HTTP-NG something, that solves all the problems of the web and the\nrest of the world, I think, it is a good idea to think about integrating\nFTP, so special command set for file transfers / universal file\ndescription :) / in HTTP-NG.

We exploit\nthis in the prototype HTTP-NG implementation; if there is a callback to\nan object on the \"client\", it goes over a new session we establish\nin the MUX over the same TCP connection, rather than establishing a new\nconnection, saving a connection establishment (with the multiple packets\nand RTT's as a result).  As RTT's are large in the Internet, this is a major\nwin for many uses.\n\nAnd about the most commonly asked for feature of the Web is some way to\nprovide notifications.  I've had people describe to me amazingly gross\nways of doing really ugly things inside of HTTP to do this.  Yuk....\n\nIf you have a cache heirarchy of proxy servers, it is perfectly reasonable\nto leave the browser's connection to a Web server open for a long time,\nand therefore the server might inform the client of some change.  Ultimately,\nwhen (if) scalable multicast can be deployed, it may be better to do\nnotification this way, but almost anyone doing collaborative work is\ndesparate for any solution, even if notification of the entire planet\nis not needed (and typical workgroups are small enough that the ultimate\nscalability is not required for most collaborative work applications).\n                        - Jim\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15253355"}, {"subject": "Re: Some clarifications", "content": ">The issue comes up of how to use the return from the server;\n>traditionally, most protocols just use the TCP stream to return\n>responses and/or errors, and you can't interspearse other traffic over\n>the return channel.\n\nThis was my question.  From your description in the BOF, it seemed to me\nthat HTTP needed an out of band (OOB) channel, what you called call back\nchannel.  Currently, TCP does not have such a thing.  By OOB channel, I\nmean a stream which is not constrained by the original TCP stream.  This\nmeans data sent/received in the OOB channel is independently handled.  My\nquestion is if there is such a OOB channel, how it will be used?\n\n>Once you have a multiplexing layer that enables its use, if the server\n>needs to call back the client, this is easy and much faster to do over\n>an existing TCP connection than establishing a new TCP connection, which\n>saves packets, the round trip times to establish a connection, and it may\n>not even be possible to establish a separate TCP connection (think about\n>how firewalls work.\n\nMutiplexing is not what I really meant.  By multiplexing several application\nstreams over a single TCP stream, all those streams are still constrained by\nthe single TCP stream.  The constraints are the result of TCP's requirement\nof in-order delivery of segments.  An OOB channel does not have this problem.\nYou may ask about all those congestion control/avoidance, timer, ... of the\nOOB channel.

I want to know if my\nunderstanding of the requirement is correct.\n\nIf the OOB channel is only used for a small amount of \"expedited\" data, the\nwhole problem can be much more easily solved in the existing TCP with some\nmodifications.  But if the OOB channel is going to be used just like another\nTCP stream, it is probably not possible because what you want is really 2\nstreams.\n\n>If you are doing a distributed object system on top, your natural programming\n>model is to send object references around that get called; method invocations\n>in this sense often invert client and server to get thie jobs done.

This \"stalled connection\" is\nso painful that human behavior is to abort the connection and restart it\n(the infamous \"stop\" button on a browser, followed by \"reload\" on the\nbrowser).  Again, better to throw away and reestablish a single TCP connection\nthan N of them, the current situation.\n\nIt is the second packet drop with is a killer, not the first (due to fast\nrestart).  If something could be done to avoid such a long timeout to\nrecover after a second packet drop, this would be goodness.\n\nWithout real experience with deployed applications, it isn't clear what\nthe consequences of this fate sharing are in practice.\n\n\n> > Yes, this is what we have in mind.

This worry is specious, in my view.\n\nIt is not clear that in fact they get more bandwidth in practice; multiple\nconnections did allow them to at least keep a modem line busier.\nIn our experience, we're able to get higher performance over a single\nconnection than exisiting implementations have gotten over 4 connections\n(see our SIGCOMM paper, and more recent tests we need to go into further\nhas our Amaya browser beating IE and Netscape over a single connection).\n\n\n\n\n> In writing such a document, please include a somewhat detailed analysis\n> of how the extra info will be used and what benefits they can bring to\n> an app.\n\n\nOf course...\n                                - Jim\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15326521"}, {"subject": "Re: Some clarifications", "content": "> It is the second packet drop with is a killer, not the first (due to fast\n> restart).

But\nif what you meant was 2 packets got dropped in a single window, either\nNewReno or SACK can recover from it without causing a timeout.  I think\nnow many implementations have both.\n\n> Without real experience with deployed applications, it isn't clear what\n> the consequences of this fate sharing are in practice.\n\nOne area it will help is because of the long train of packets, fast\nretransmit/recovery or SACK can be invoked to recover from packet loss.\nThis is not true if there are only a few packets in transit, which will not\ntrigger enough duplicate ACKs to invoke those recovery mechanisms.\n\nFrom TCP's point of view, this is a single stream.  So all our understandings\nof TCP's congestion and loss recovery behaviors still apply.  OTOH, if\nwe use TCP state sharing, it is not clear how multiple streams to the\nsame host will react to those network events.\n\nThe only implementation I know of which has this TCP state sharing is\nfrom the Berkeley folks.  Their simulation results look good.  But since\nthe shared state structure is accessed by all TCP connections to the\nsame host whenever a packet is sent or received, it will not scale in real\nworld.\n\nSo I think having a mux over TCP is a better solution to your problem in the\nmeantime.  I guess this is what you guys think too...\n\n                                                        K.

This worry is specious, in my view.\n\nNo, I am not against letting applications know more about the connection\nstate.  But I want to point out that this can also give \"bad\" apps more\ninfo to abuse the network in ways that are more detrimental than they\nare doing today.\n\n> It is not clear that in fact they get more bandwidth in practice; multiple\n> connections did allow them to at least keep a modem line busier.\n> In our experience, we're able to get higher performance over a single\n> connection than exisiting implementations have gotten over 4 connections\n> (see our SIGCOMM paper, and more recent tests we need to go into further\n> has our Amaya browser beating IE and Netscape over a single connection).\n\nThe results in your paper may not apply here.  Firstly, I think we are\ntalking about a general mux over TCP, not HTTP specific.  So the pipelining\nand compression techniques may not be applied because the mux does not know\nabout the application's transfer behavior so it cannot tune its behavior.\nSuppose the app knows about the mux, it also may not be able to tune its\ntransfer behavior to fit the model.  Not all apps are like HTTP.\n\nSecondly, probably the only test case in your paper which may show the\nunfairness of multiple TCP streams is the high bandwidth/high latency test.\nThe reason is that this is the case where those connections pass through\nlinks which are shared by other network traffic.  In this case, to show\nthat using more connections do not let an app get more bandwidth, you need\nto compare HTTP 1.0 results using, say 2 and 4, connections.  Showing\nHTTP 1.1 is better just tells us that HTTP 1.1 is better than 1.0.  It\ndoes not really tell us about performance implication of multiple TCP\nconnections.\n\nAs I mentioned in my previous mail, a long train (I also imply larger window\nhere) of packets helps in recovering packet loss.  If HTTP 1.0's transfer\nsize is small in your tests, a packet loss may cause a timeout.  This can have\na big effect on the results.  So for a general mux, we need to know the\ntransfer size of an app before we can do any comparison.  Your results may\napply if the app we are talking about has similar transfer size as HTTP 1.0.\n\nOTOH, a few studies have shown that an app using multiple connections\ngets an unfair advantage over an app using single connection.  This has to\ndo with how the congestion window is increased and how TCP reacts to packet\nloss.  Using multiple connections is more aggressive in both cases.  Note\nthat this does not imply that the app will get better throughput.  It may\nor may not, depending on the network condition.  That is why I mentioned\nabove that if a \"bad\" app knows more about the network condition, it may be\nable to abuse the network in a smarter way.\n\n                                                        K.

Performance as the relative incentive to install these pairs, initially.\nEvolution, later: making it easier to churn out new protocols\n\n@@by analogy to how XML cleans up SGML to make it easier to churn out new\ntagsets\n\nAllaire's XML-over-HTTP code tree will go open source tomorrow. Jim called\nit a \"train wreck\": makes it impossible to allow firewalls to read inside\nenvelopes. Hallam-Baker: train-wrecks are good things, motivating change.\n\nOf course, transparent replacement of HTTP/1.1 is a GWS (goes without\nsaying).\n\nTransition also needs metadata about servers' version level from DNS or so.\n\nJim Gettys presented the charter overview. The app and tsv ADs jointly\ndecided this should be in Transport (under Vern Paxson).\nProposed chair: Jim Gettys and Mike Spreitzer.\n\nWhich of the three layers provides security?  Certainly lowest;\nmiddle might get involved too; upper builds on the services of the lower two.\n\nThe lower layers are more \"baked\".\n\nOpen question: timelines and action items and milestones.\n\nDeliberately Excluded: language mappings, remote-invocation layer APIs, any\nenhancement of Web semantics, replacing TCP.\n\nPresented an 18-month plan. Yaron: \"triple it\". Huitema commented \"either\nit's possible in 6 months or it's not\"  Mike: we have three overlapping 6-month\nplans, one for each layer.  Touch: \"where's minimalism, 'don't\nput it in if you don't need it'\". Mike: \"of course, there has to be\nconservatism to succeed\".  Huitema: \"either you have a solution or a warplan\n-- committee hacking?\"\n\nHenrik: HTTP/1.1 is getting more complex all the time, and the interactions\nare growing exponentially. We need to start over with something that will be\nsimpler at the lower layers.\n\nJim: the alternative -- today -- is very complicated indeed.\n\nJoe: work the goal \"keep it simple\" into the charter. True, it's \"apple\npie\", but say it anyway.\n\nLawrence: the new version of this document has been genericized to the point\nthat everyone can agree with it without neccessarily agreeing with anyone\nelse. As a rationale for chartering a WG, it's lack of concreteness and\ntestable assertions is a weakness.\n\nMike: we had a more specific document, a very specific charter that was\nthrown back at us. We wrote it to be \"specifically vague\"\n\nHardie: something was lost in the round-trip, such as Janssen's design\nprinciples. One was \"generic platform for services\". The logic seems to go,\npeople are tunnelling and layering every damn thing you can think of onto\nHTTP, so let's design something explicitly designed for tunnelling and\nlayering every damn thing you can think of.\n\nHenrik: you can't start off a working group debating the problem itself...\n\nYaron: I object to using HTTP in the name. It looks much more like lessons\nlearned from HTTP, but it's not an evolutionary descendant. Second, there's\na shooting war in D-O standards marketplace, and IETF should stay out at\nrisk of its own credibility. Instead allow more time for 1.1 to be deployed,\nget experience with IPP, DAV, etc; and let the wars settle out.\n\nMike: in fact, their war is elsewhere; we've been talking to some of them\nabout providing the wire protocol. They're worried about the APIs.\n\nPhill: If the goal is to provide another resolution service for http://\nurls, then this IS the natural successor transport and SHOULD be called\nHTTP-NG. It's a massive installed base. Too many WGs are reinventing HTTP as\nit is. If not one, we'll have fifty.\n\nScott: I'd prefer fifty :-) First, there has been a great deal of private\nW3C discussion, but the public list is quiescent [it's now considered the\nmain list]. Second, the charter is pretty broad. The separation in three is\ngood, though I disagree significantly with the third. Negotiable muxing of\nstacks is a great idea. Out-of-order responses would be great.\nCompact-encoding is great -- but switching to an object framework seems, to\nme, to be neither necessary nor the most effective. Just re-encoding\nHTTP/1.1 would be a trivial, effective, and useful exercise that we should\nall do. Finally, the charter doesn't exclude things which could slow it down\nto 4+ years. Saying it's a full DO system and narrowing it to support TCWA\nonly invites \"experts.\" Split into subgroups... Jim: ADs discouraged that.\nVern: I'm finding this discussion very helpful...\n\nEliot (? AAA bof leader): After bashing out a requirements draft, the\ncharter may have to be re-bashed. Second, enough work has been done to avoid\nbeing remanded to IRTF\n\nMark Day: take away the letters HTTP and convince me you're still part of\nthe solution.\n\nMike: we need to reduce the number of these things. We want one thing, which\nreplaces HTTP. Realign the Web application in this direction, and everything\nelse will follow.\n\nJim: if we can even develop recyclable parts from this effort, it will have\nbeen worthwhile\n\nBlack WOMAD shirt: I'm worried there's running code. Even a prototype ends\nup constraining the requirement space.\n\nMike: \"I was not under the impression that the WG would see my code and roll\nover\" :-)\n\nJim: I am very tired of several years' worth of arguments with no data. I\ninsist on data.\n\n[It's not just Mike's code alone, of course]\n\nJim Whitehead: By focusing on just what the Web currently does, you could be\nrisking a second system effect. I want to ask \"Where's the Hypertext\"? There\nare lots of ideas in the HT community that are not reflected in the charter\nGettys: and deliberately so! JW: I'd at least like to see TCWA spun out, to\nreach beyond the classic apps, IPP, WebDAV, RDF metadata for links,\nalternative name resolution, caching, etc. Further out, I'd like to see some\neconomics: integrating payment and security.\n\n[Note that a DAV-NG prototype was discussed by PARC in Chicago]\n\nMike: we were nervous about calling out a set of applications, because they\ndon't form success criteria. All the current IETF HTTP derivatives are on\nour radar; are in that set. But, App area is unenthusiastic about chartering\na new Web group\n\nRohit: well, several startup companies have been focused on 'fast http\nlinks' by cutting all kinds of corners and still haven't produced dramatic\nresults -- what have they said during the W3C gestation of this project? A:\nnone\n\nScott: the secret of the Web is its anarchism. The loose coupling between\ndata and serving process is extremely valuable.\n\nHenrik: lots of new restrictions on caches, rights mgmt, payment, etc. And\nif they're not going through extensible proxy caches, they'll be\nshort-circuited.\n\nScott: the notion that creating a better application framework will convert\npeople from hiding their application data in an opaque media type is to get\nthrough firewalls. What you're doing, quite correctly, makes it easier to\nwrite more intelligent firewalls, but app developers will still hide out at\nthe highest layer.\n\nMike: distinguish between extensions of HTTP and of HTML. I see a lot of\ninterest in a \"pun\". forms, which are simultaneouly an API and an interface.\nBut that's not the end-all.\n\nCarl-Uno: your factoring is a fine idea. IPP would be interested in the two\nlower layers (Transport, to me). But the continuation of the HTTP is an\nApplications area project, in parallel with close interaction. If you think\nit's going to take 1.5 yrs, it'll be 3, but if you split it, maybe 2.\n\nJoe: put that performance chart back up... it's only a 5-10% performance\ndifference. The big gain was from HTTP/1.0 to totally optimized HTTP/1.1.\nShow me 20-30-40% Gettys: cache-validation is already 4x faster Scott: but\nwhat if you just abbreviated 1.1 messages Gettys: that would be another\nvalid approach. That knocked out the 1) perf argument 2) the generic app\nargument 3) tweak HTTP. You can't prevent programmers from 2), so you're\neither left with 3a) a 6-month 1.2 version, or 3b) an IRTF project to\nreinvent the Web.\n\nHenrik: people aren't evil, they just can't see how to do it easily\nJoe: so write a book instead :-)\nHenrik: you can't do it in 1.1: there's too many dependencies.\nJoe: and how will modularizing it solve the problem?\nHenrik: the interactions don't get simpler, but the 'vertical' ones will\n\nGreg Callahan (NFS4 on ONC RPC group chair): the transport area already has\na single RPC layer project: why not use the ONC? Mike: our prototype does\nuse ONC+XDR, with slight extensions.\n\nMike: one clear difference is that ONC doesn't have objects at all. Huitema:\ngood! it's simple enough it's picked up on an application-by-application\nbasis. Mike: then why isn't it used for Internet-wide use? We belive there\nare fixable insufficiencies in existing solutions just as we found with Web\nover ILU a long time. We want to smooth out the warts that make it\ninadvisable for Internet-scale use. Huitema: then why not call it the\nInternet RPC WG? Mike: because you need to limit the scope to the Web to\nremove some complexity. Scott: that's no real limitation; you track every\nnew application of the Web and you never close.  Mike: yes, we'll eventually\nhave to stop tracking and leave that to others; hopefully at that point the\ntracking we will have done will have given us a sufficiently robust system.\n\nYaron: note that the lower you go on the stack the more excited people are\nhere. I'd love to MUX straight HTTP/1.1. How about a group whose sole job\nwas muxing, properly chartered in Transport. And THEN, open a new WG, and so\non.\n\nJosh: \"if they're trying to do HTTP then why are they doing a DO system?\" is\na fair charge. But it shouldn't be named HTTP. I also don't agree there's a\nterrible problem which merits rebuilding from scratch. You've said the\nfatals are lack of caching, error code limits, yada, yada, but they each\nseem fixable in increments. Why not patch ONC, or patch HTTP? The work\neffort needs to modularize.\n\nHuitema: the basis of your argument is that HTTP has been polluted by people\nusing to all sorts of things. That's a fact of life. Our first Bellcore\nvoicemail over ethernet in 1983 used FTP? In the late 80s, it was 822. Reuse\nsomeone else's infrastructure until you have critical mass to become your\nown application. It's like if I wanted to change email to make it easier to\ndo transactions back then...\n\nMike: resolved, people think the factoring is good; MUX has strong support.\n\nYaron: \"It's the MUX stupid!\"\n\nJim: I sense that we should 1) work on MUX and 2) and make requirements on\nHTTP-NG. No opinion on whether it's one group or two.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15350040"}, {"subject": "Draft report on HTTP-NG BOF at IETF-43", "content": "Below is a draft report on the BOF, to be submitted for the Proceedings.\nPlease review and comment (soon, unfortunetaly).

Presenting the case for such a Working Group were Jim Gettys, Henrik\nFrystyk Nielsen, and Mike Spreitzer.  There was significant interest, with much\napproval and also some significant dissent.  Ultimately there was consensus to\nmove forward with some of the work and to consider the rest more carefully.\nThe details follow.\n\nHenrik Frystyk Nielsen opened the session by setting the context.  There was an\nHTTP-NG BOF at IETF-42 in Chicago in August, at which there was a detailed\nintroduction to the proposed work for the IETF.  Reaction was mild and\ngenerally favorable (minutes, which did not make it into the official IETF-42\nproceedings, can be found at\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG/1998/08/HTTP-NG-BOF-Minutes.html).\nHowever, there was no proposed charter or chair at that time, and so no WG\ncould be formed.  Now we have proposed chair, Jim Gettys and Mike Spreitzer,\nand charter, which will be presented here.\n\nHenrik also presented some results obtained in the W3C testbed since August.\nHe showed a slide reporting time and bytes used to transfer the Microscape page\n(including inlined images) and a simple test page over a path that included a\nwireless link.  The graphs showed HTTP/1.1 making a large improvement over\nHTTP/1.0, and HTTP-NG making a modest improvement over HTTP/1.1.  The 1.1 test\nused libwww, a highly optimized 1.1 implementation; the NG test was in the\nILU-based testbed, which has received essentially no performance tuning.\n\nMike Spreitzer then lead a presentation of\ndraft-frystyk-httpng-overview-00.txt, a draft overview of the problem\nstatement, requirements, and solution outline for the proposed HTTP-NG Working\nGroup.  The presentation was a brief introduction to the I-D's contents; a few\ncomments augmented those contents, as follows.  There are two dimensions of\nmodularity: a \"vertical\" modularity of layering and a \"horizontal\" modularity\nof independent multiple protocol modules at the same layer.  The https URI\nscheme is an example of layering failure: just adding security required going\nto a new namespace, and without an upgrading facility.  It may be desirable to\nfurther split the middle layer into two sublayers: one for the control aspects\nand one for data formatting.  The transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP-NG should be\neasier than, e.g., the transition to IPv6, because it can be done on a\nlink-by-link basis instead of having to be available end-to-end.  So adopters\ncan be incented incrementally, initially focusing on client/server (one-hop,\nnot browser/origin-server) pairs that can most clearly see a high payoff;\npossible examples include: high-level cache and origin server; browser and\nlow-level cache (e.g., over wireless link); low-level and high-level cache.\nThe possible payoffs include: performance, functionality (resulting from better\nevolvability), and manageability (a multifaceted concept, including firewall\nconsiderations).  An analogy was made between the way HTTP-NG increases HTTP's\nmodularity and the way XML, by simplifying SGML and generalizing HTML, makes it\neasier to churn out new tag sets.  The current situation, with HTTP being\ncloned and tunnelled through in a number of ways, was characterized by some as\na \"train wreck\".  Among other things, it makes it difficult for a firewall to\ndiscern what's really going through it.  Some suggested this \"train wreck\" is\nreally a good thing, just a healthy diversity of protocol re-use.  Others\nconsidered it a success disaster, motivating change.\n\nJim Gettys then gave a brief introduction to the proposed charter.\nHere is the proposed charter:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n                           IETF HTTP-NG Charter\n\nWorking Group Name\n\n   * HTTP Next Generation (httpng)\n\nIETF Area\n\n   * Transport Area\n\nChairs\n\n   * Jim Gettys <jg@w3.org>\n   * Mike Spreitzer <spreitze@parc.xerox.com>\n\nTransport Area Directors\n\n   * Scott Bradner <sob@harvard.edu>\n   * Vern Paxson <vern@ee.lbl.gov>\n\nResponsible Area Director\n\n   * Vern Paxson\n\nMailing List\n\nThe <ietf-http-ng@w3.org> mailing list and archives\n(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-ng/) are available\nfor discussions of HTTP-NG. Postings to this mailing list from\nnon-subscribers are moderated in order to avoid spam, everything\nelse will be passed as is.  See the W3C Mailing list administrativia\n(http://www.w3.org/Mail/Request.html) for details.\n\nDescription of Working Group\n\nThe goal of this working group is to produce a next generation of the HTTP\nprotocol that builds on the experience from HTTP/1.x --- notably including\nproxies, caching, and firewalls --- by adding explicit layering and\nmodularity to better support the World Wide Web and the other applications\nthat are being layered on top of, and just plain tunnelled through, HTTP.\nThe WG goals will emphasize transitioning existing application\nfunctionality to a better technology base, rather than improving the\napplication functionality.\n\nThe WG will first develop a requirements document detailing the needed\nchanges to the HTTP/1.x protocol. An already-existing draft of this\ndocument calls for the factoring of HTTP into three layers: the lowest will\nprovide opaque message transport services needed by the next layer,\nbuilding upon current and/or future Internet transport protocols such as\nTCP and UDP; the middle will be a general remote invocation layer; and the\nhighest will be an expression of the web application in terms of the lower\ntwo.\n\nThe WG will then proceed to standardize the pieces into which HTTP is to be\nfactored. The WG will also develop techniques for the transition of the Web\nfrom HTTP/1.x to HTTP-NG.\n\nThe following work is specifically excluded from the scope of this working\ngroup: definitions of language mappings and/or ancillary APIs for the\nremote invocation layer; significantly advancing the functionality of web\napplications; development of base transport protocols (e.g. any replacement\nfor TCP).\n\nBecause HTTP's functionality spans a range that includes both the Transport\nand Application areas of the IETF, this working group should draw\nparticipants from both areas.\n\nThe working group will ensure that there is an adequate flow of information\nbetween the working group and the W3C allowing W3C to better coordinate W3C\nActivities related to HTTP-NG and to provide input to the working group.\n\nGoals and Milestones\n\n   * 1998/12 - I-D of problem statement and solution outline\n   * 1999/01 - I-D of W3C project's proposal for message transport layer\n   * 1999/01 - I-D of W3C project's proposal for invocation layer\n   * 1999/04 - Problem statement and solution outline submitted to IESG for\n     publication as Informational RFC\n   * 1999/06 - WG consensus I-D on message transport layer\n   * 1999/08 - WG consensus I-D on invocation layer\n   * 1999/11 - WG consensus I-D on web application interfaces\n   * 1999/11 - message transport layer specification submitted to IESG for\n     publication as Proposed Standard\n   * 2000/02 - invocation layer specification submitted to IESG for\n     publication as Proposed Standard\n   * 2000/05 - web application interfaces submitted to IESG for publication\n     as Proposed Standard\n\nWorking Drafts and Notes\n\nHere is the list of drafts that were presented and discussed at the HTTP-NG\nBOF at IETF-42:\n\n   * HTTP-ng Architectural Model (draft-frystyk-httpng-arch-00.txt),\n     Internet Draft, August 1, 1998\n   * HTTP-ng Web Interfaces (draft-larner-nginterfaces-00.txt), Internet\n     Draft, August 1, 1998\n   * HTTP-ng Binary Wire Protocol (draft-janssen-httpng-wire-00.txt),\n     Internet Draft, August 1, 1998\n   * WebMUX Protocol Specification (draft-gettys-webmux-00.txt), Internet\n     Draft, August 1, 1998\n   * Design of HTTP-ng Testbed, W3C Note, 10 July 1998\n   * Short- and Long-Term Goals for the HTTP-NG Project, W3C Note, 27 March\n     1998\n\nBackground Information\n\n   * HTTP-NG BOF at the IETF Chicago Meeting, August 23-28 (minutes at\nhttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG/1998/08/HTTP-NG-BOF-Minutes.html)\n   * Check the W3C HTTP-NG overview (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP-NG) for\nmore information.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nIt was noted that the dates on the milestones are particularly tentative.\n\nDiscussion then ensued.\n\nSecurity was discussed.  The design in the drafts was reiterated: the design\nstarts with the lowest layer providing some subset of authentication, message\nintegrity, and message secrecy; the middle layer may add to that; and in the\nhighest layer the application starts to build on the services provided by the\nlower layers.  There was concern that collaborators inside and outside a\nfirewall could still collude to tunnel information through the more\nunderstandable channel being created.  Due to time pressures, the conversation\nwas cut short before anyone could observe that that's always true and that\nnonetheless there are benefits to making traffic more comprehensible to\nfirewalls.\n\nMany participants, although not all, felt that the lower layers were more\n\"baked\" than the higher ones.  The audience generally found the available\ndocuments about the lower layers to be more clearly understandable than the\ndocuments about the higher ones.  It should be noted that the attendance was\ndominated by the Transport Area, although there definitely were some\nApplications Area people in attendance (although the Apps ADs were not among\nthem).\n\nThere was concern that the charter wasn't specific enough (\"lack of\nconcreteness and testable assertions\") --- that everybody could agree to the\ntext in the charter without actually agreeing with each other about what it\nmeans --- and that this was a weakness.  The proponents actually have a much\nmore detailed opinion, but many of those details were deliberately kept out of\nthe charter on the grounds that they are things the WG should debate and reach\nconsensus on.  Some felt that too much, such as design principles articulated\nby Bill Janssen at the previous BOF, was left out of the proposed charter.\nThere was concern about leaving the WG with too much problem definition work to\nstart out with.  In the interest of getting through all the audience's input in\ntime, the discussion moved on before satisfactorily finishing with this topic.\n\nThere was some discussion of the length of time that would be required.  In the\ninterest of getting through all the audience's input in time, the discussion\nmoved on before satisfactorily finishing with this topic\n\nThere was concern about the current competition in the distributed object\nstandards marketplace (CORBA vs. DCOM vs. Java RMI vs. web-based thingies vs.\n...); perhaps the IETF cannot and should not try to settle this; instead get\nmore deployment and experience with HTTP/1.1, IPP, DAV, etc and wait for the\nmarketplace to settle the wars.  Not everyone agreed that this is the right\nreaction.  It was also noted that the competition is mainly over API turf, and\nthat the combatants have shown considerable flexibility on protocol.  The\nHTTP-NG proponents have had favorable discussions with the OMG and with\nMicrosoft's DCOM group (representatives of neither of which were in evidence at\nthe BOF) about the possibility of running CORBA and DCOM over HTTP-NG's lower\ntwo layers.  In the interest of getting through all the audience's input in\ntime, the discussion moved on before satisfactorily finishing with this topic.\n\nThere was debate over the appropriateness of using \"HTTP\" in the name.  Some\nfelt that the genericity of the lower two layers, and the lack of byte-wise\nprotocol continuity with HTTP/1.1, makes it inappropriate to use \"HTTP\" in the\nname.  Others felt that as the goals include replacing HTTP, the proposed name\nis fair.  In the interest of getting through all the audience's input in time,\nthe discussion moved on before satisfactorily finishing with this topic.\n\nThere was concern that the proposal was too ambitious, in that it opens too big\na can of design worms.  Some argued for making a set of incremental changes to\nHTTP/1.1; others (including authors of the HTTP/1.1 spec) argued that progress\non 1.1 is very difficult due to its lack of modularity, that's why HTTP-NG\nshould be done.  Others asked: why take up design of a new remote invocation\nprotocol when the IETF already has ONC RPC?  The proponents answered that what\nthey have done can be viewed as an extension of ONC RPC to deal with ways in\nwhich it is deficient for supporting Internet applications such as the WWW.\nLack of support for objects was cited as one such deficiency, although some in\nthe audience thought that was a Good Thing.  No other deficiencies were\nmentioned, due to lack of time.  Another question was: why create another such\nprotocol when the world already has too many?  The answer is that the intent is\nto unify the existing ones: move the web onto a suitably general HTTP-NG, and\nthe other distributed object systems will adopt NG's invocation protocol.\nAnother question was: wouldn't designing a new remote invocation protocol\ninvite \"experts\" from all over, making the design process drag on forever?\nSome felt that the work on the middle layer should be remanded to the IRTF.\nOthers felt that enough work had been done to show that there is an acceptable\nsolution, so it's not research and wouldn't take forever to reach consensus on.\nOn the other hand, concern was also expressed that an existing prototype would\nunduely constrain the requirements-setting phase; not everyone was worried\nabout this, and having a measurable prototype is a good thing.  The proponents\npointed out that they had deliberately put in a scope limitation to actual\napplications, rather than all the existing middleware systems (e.g., Java RMI,\nDCOM, and some CORBA implementations) that can currently tunnel through HTTP,\nas a way to limit desiderata brought to bear on the middle layer.  There was\nconcern that having to track application development would be a never-ending\ntask.  Naturally an HTTP-NG WG would at some point have to say \"enough!\", and\nhopefully by then it would have a sufficiently general protocol to be useful in\nother applications without needing to explicitly prepare for them.  In the\ninterest of getting through all the audience's input in time, the discussion\nmoved on before satisfactorily finishing with this topic.\n\nSome argued that the proposed work should be split into two WGs, one on the\nlower two layers and one on the highest layer (the \"web application\").  This\nhas several virtues.  One is that this would allow better alignment with IETF\nAreas: the higher WG could go into the Apps Area, with the lower WG in\nTransport.  Another is general manageability: divide and conquer.  Another is\nthat work should be done on improving the web application's functionality\n(something expressly excluded in the proposed charter above) --- that is,\nparticular extensions, not just extensibility --- and that it would naturally\nfind a home in the upper of two HTTP-NG WGs.  On the other hand, forming just\none WG has some virtues too.  The Apps Area is currently overloaded, and simply\ncannot take on a new major chunk of work.  Another is that keeping all the\nHTTP-NG work together helps make sure it really works together.  And it is\nappropriate to view HTTP-NG as a single integrated effort, because it needs to\nreplace a single integrated protocol (HTTP/1.1).  In the interest of getting\nthrough all the audience's input in time, the discussion moved on before\nsatisfactorily finishing with this topic.\n\nThere was a misplaced concern about replacing the web application's use of the\nopen extensible Internet Media Type (AKA MIME type) space with something else\n(not sure what); the proposal is actually to keep that as it is.  It was noted\nthat some applications deliberately try to \"pun\" a user interface and a\nprogrammatic interface together into one thing (typically an HTML form).  These\napplications will continue to layer over HTML and all of HTTP/whatever,\nregardless of what \"whatever\" is, because they want all of the web\napplication's functionality; they don't care directly about factoring HTTP, but\nwill appreciate any incidental benefits such as improvements in performance,\nfunctionality, etc.\n\nThere was concern that the performance gains will be too small to justify the\neffort.  The slide that Henrik showed at the start showed only a modest\nperformance gain.  However, that compared a well tuned 1.1 implementation\nagainst a poorly tuned (some might say de-tuned) NG implementation.  And it\ndoesn't prove that more gains can't be had.  And it addresses only one\nscenario.  In the interest of getting through all the audience's input in time,\nthe discussion moved on before satisfactorily finishing with this topic.\n\nJim Gettys tested and found consensus to proceed with work on the lowest layer\nand to work on more clearly articulating the problem statement and requirements\nfor the rest of HTTP-NG.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15367707"}, {"subject": "FW: HTTP Design Issues, lessons from WebDAV's Property and Depth header experiences", "content": "Despite the disclaimer about HTTP-NG in here, these seem like useful\ndesign criteria for HTTP-NG.\n\nLarry\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Yaron Goland [mailto:yarong@microsoft.com]\nSent: Thursday, December 24, 1998 12:01 AM\nTo: 'Slein, Judith A'; Masinter, Larry <masinter@parc.xerox.com>; Jim\nDavis; w3c-dist-auth@w3.org\nCc: Henrik Frystyk Nielsen (E-mail); Roy T.

Instead of\nusing one method for one function, WebDAV essentially re-invented the HTTP\nrequest/response format in XML so it could glue a bunch of requests\ntogether. The reasons it did this are:\n\n1) Pipelining - It is and isn't supported in HTTP/1.1. Currently HTTP/1.1\nbans the use of non-idempotent methods across pipelining. This is fine for\nPROPFIND but a real problem if we are to use PROPPATCH in pipelined mode.\nEven so, the reality is that WebDAV will have to run primarily across\nHTTP/1.0 connections for a real long time due the relatively sparse support\nfor HTTP/1.1 proxies. So we wanted to pack a bunch of related messages into\na single request. Hopefully, when HTTP/1.1 proxy support is sufficiently\nwide spread, this motivation will go away.\n\n2) Byte Bloat - In many cases multiple method calls on the wire will be\nalmost identical. For example, imagine if PROPFIND did the right thing and\nonly allowed you to request a single property. Now imagine you wanted to\nretrieve 50 properties. You would end up with 50 requests that were\ncompletely identical except for one string. There was a sticky header\nproposal but WebDAV makes extensive use of the body so we would also need a\nsticky body/diff proposal as well.\n\n3) Relatedness - Every time a request comes in a server has to roll out a\nnew context to handle that message. However if you are going to get a bunch\nof related requests, say 50 PROPPATCHs, each wanting to change a single\nproperty, you would rather just keep re-using the same context. But because\nof the shear volume of messages coming in, a server wants to be told if a\ncontext should be re-used. WebDAV achieves this by allowing methods to\nimplicitly contain multiple requests, like PROPFIND letting you set 50\nproperties at once. We need a way in HTTP to do the same without having to\nre-invent HTTP, as WebDAV has had to do. We need to tell the server \"the\nfollowing requests are all related\".\n\n4) Unmatched Responses - There are times when a method needs to apply across\nan unknown number of resources. For example, performing a COPY with a depth\nheader. You don't know which resources existed in the hierarchy when you\nexecuted the request. However you still need to get back responses for any\nresources that may have had a problem with the COPY, even though you never\neven knew they existed. WebDAV deals with this by using the multistatus\nresponse which just wraps up all the information. Of course, multistatus is\nreally just the HTTP response format in XML. What would be better is if HTTP\nsupported the ability to send responses w/out associated requests. In order\nto keep bytes down you would also then need to be able to apply the \"Byte\nBloat\" solution to the responses. Bonus points are that the folks in\nnotification land also need this feature.\n\nSo if HTTP/1.1 was enhanced or HTTP/1.2 was introduced with support for\nfeatures 1-4 then WebDAV could get out of the protocol\nbloating/extensibility killing business of re-inventing HTTP and instead\nactually use HTTP secure in the knowledge that the performance it so\ndesperately needs will be there.\n\n        <Side Note>\nI can hear Henrik in my head. Unfortunately I hear him in Danish so I can't\nunderstand a word he is saying. But knowing Henrik I suspect it is something\nlike \"Repent ye sinners, HTTP NG is the one true way.\" True or not, I for\none really don't want to throw away an entire invested base. Especially\ngiven that I think the previous features, with a little creative use of the\nBATCH method, could be built over the existing infrastructure.\n        </Side Note>\n</Skipping to the End>\n\n<Why I Bother>\nAnd now, for the two case studies which lead to the previous conclusions. If\nyou actually make it to the end, you clearly have way the hell too much time\non your hands. I'm writing these out mostly so:\n        A) I don't forget\n        B) I can beat people over the head with them when they try to make\nthe same damn stupid fool mistakes\n</Why I Bother>\n\n<\"This is another fine protocol you've gotten me into!\">\nIn a previous episode\n(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0074.html) I\nprovided some history behind WebDAV's property architecture. However once\nthe basic architecture was agreed upon there was still much work to be done.\n\nThe first issue was the ability to set the value of multiple properties in a\nsingle atomic act. It was assumed by the working group that multiple\ndependent properties would exist on a resource. That is, that the value of\none property would be related to the value of another. Thus if a client\nwishes to change both values and only one actually got changed the resource\nwould be in an inconsistent state. Hence it was critical that a mechanism be\nprovided to allow clients to set multiple property values atomically. In\nretrospect I wonder how critical this requirement really was. Especially\ngiven that none of the existing implementations are really atomic, at least\nnot in the transacted sense meant in the spec. But, at the time, we were\npositive that this requirement was critical and so it ended up in the spec.\n\nIn trying to fulfill the requirement my primary concern was to keep the\nmethods simple. I have always liked slogans and I vaguely remember inventing\n\"one method, one property\". This certainly would result in a simpler\nprotocol. But if each property was sent in a different method, how would we\nmeet the atomicity requirement? One possibility was to use a protocol like\nTIP to implement real transactioning. But this was clearly too heavy a\nrequirement for base DAV servers. The next proposal was to use an \"atomic\"\nmethod. The idea was that one would send the atomic method followed by the\nproperty change methods followed by another atomic method. However there\nwere two problems:\n\n        1) HTTP servers were generally designed to handle each request in\ntotal isolation. Each request, even over a pipelined connection, was handled\nby a different execution context. Thus it was very difficult for the servers\nto associate requests with each other. Even if the servers could associate\nthe requests, this still left the relatively high cost of having to create a\nbrand new context for each and every method. The message from the server\ncommunity was crystal clear - the less requests across the wire, the better.\nThis was especially true given that the server community was not ready to\ncompletely redesign their servers to do better context handling.\n\n        2) Even though WebDAV is officially an HTTP/1.1 protocol, in reality\neveryone knew it was going to spend the first few years of its life running\nover HTTP/1.0. This meant there was no pipelining support. Thus every\nproperty to be set, in addition to the \"atomic\" methods, would have to be\nsent on their own, independent, round trips. The performance ramifications\nwere too horrific to consider.\n\n\"one method, one property\" was still not quite dead. A proposal had been\nkicking around for a BATCH method. The idea was that one would take a group\nof methods, glue them together, shove them inside of the BATCH method and\nsend them to the server. The atomic nature of the requests would be implicit\nto the BATCH. There was even a proposal to throw in an \"atomic\" switch so\nthat it would be possible to not ask for atomic behavior. The assumption\nbeing that outside of certain predefined contexts such as a group of\nPROPPATCHs, servers wouldn't be able to support atomicity.\n\nIn retrospect I wish I had given this choice more attention, it would have\nresulted in a significantly simpler protocol. Alas, I helped to lead the\neffort to kill BATCH. The argument was that BATCH essentially tunnels\nthrough HTTP. It robs HTTP of its caching and firewalling features. These\narguments are true, but the real choice was amongst greater and lesser\nevils. Which was worse, to try and fix some very serious performance issues\nin HTTP in a backwards compatible manner or to make WebDAV about a factor of\n2 more complex?\n\nWith both separate methods and BATCH considered unacceptable the \"one\nmethod, one property\" philosophy was dead. The only remaining solution was\nto create a composite method inside of PROPPATCH. I don't remember if this\nsolution coincided with the introduction of multistatus for\nCOPY/MOVE/PROPFIND/PROPPATCH results but I wouldn't be surprised. They both\nsuffer from the same illness, they essentially re-invent BATCH but for only\na single method and in a completely non-reusable way. That is, if we had\nactually worked the bugs out of BATCH we could have used it as essentially a\n\"transport\" and run our methods over it. The composite forms used in\nPROPFIND/PROPPATCH and multi-status, on the other hand, end up having to\nre-invent most of the HTTP features and to keep on re-inventing them over\nand over again for each method.\n\n>From there it was an obvious step to adding the same composite support for\nPROPFIND. Everyone was ecstatic about both methods. The property store guys\ncould implement the properties easily, the server guys could process the\nmessages and responses efficiently and the client guys could do all their\nbusiness in one round trip. What could possibly be better? I would find the\nirony funny if I wasn't responsible for so many of the bad decisions.\n</\"This is another fine protocol you've gotten me into!\">\n\n<Out of our Depth>\nThe \"one method, one property\" slogan got some more play as the \"one method,\none action\" slogan a.k.a. the Depth Wars. The idea was a simple one. People\nlike to COPY/MOVE/DELETE using the URL hierarchy. That way you can say\n\"Delete this resource and all its children\" without even having to know who\nthe children are. The proposed solution to allow this very cool\nfunctionality was the depth header. Just slap it on a request and it will\napply to that resource and all the children of that resource to the\nspecified level. Very neat.\n\nBut there was a lone voice which objected. The voice belonged to Henry\nSanders. Even though most of the people working on WebDAV had no idea who\nHenry was, he still got a lot of respect. As it happens Henry is one of the\nfounding members of the HTTP WG and basically is \"the\" DEV for the HTTP\nstack in IIS. Before writing IIS's HTTP stack he also wrote Microsoft's\nTCP/IP implementation. So if you do know who Henry is, you listen to what he\nsays.\n\nHenry felt that the depth header unnecessarily complicated the protocol. He\nfelt that people were trying to build their UI in the protocol, one of the\ncardinal WebDAV no-nos. But most importantly, he felt that the depth header\nwas essentially a form of denial of service attack. His argument went as\nfollows:\n\n        1) File systems have absolutely no support for depth operations.\nWhen you execute that recursive copy in Windows or MAC or UNIX, the copy\nprogram is actually talking to the OS and doing a file by file copy. That\nwas what Henry meant by UI. Recursive copy is a fiction created by UI.\n\n        2) Each individual copy/move operation takes a long time. To put\nthis time into context, serving a single non-recursive copy/move request can\ntake longer than a full round trip between the client and server. Now\nimagine how long it would take to do all the requests for the whole tree in\none go.\n\n        3) Servers can only contain a certain number of message contexts at\na time. By requiring the server to keep a context open and running for the\nenormous length of time needed to perform a recursive operation we were\ndenying service to everyone else. Put another way, a server can only handle\nN simultaneous requests. A recursive operation takes so damn long that for\nall intents and purposes a full context is assigned to a single user.\nMeaning that all the other users are forced to share the remaining contexts.\nIf, on the other hand, the client had to make a separate request for each\ncopy/move (meaning no depth header support) then the client's request would\nbe \"spread out\" over a period of time and everyone else would get a fair\nchance at the server's resources.\n\n        Therefore - The depth header should not be supported. Instead the\nclient should perform a look up of the name of all the children of the\ncurrent resource. Then the client should issue a series of COPY requests for\nall those children. Pipelining would keep down the round trip costs and it\nis worth the extra context costs on the server because separating the\nmessages guaranteed equal access to the server's resources by all clients.\n\nThe counter voices belonged mostly to people who didn't use the file system\nas their stores or had extremely advanced file systems. These stores could\ndo things like copy/move on write/read. The server would leave itself a note\nsaying that \"resource a/b was copied to a/c.\" So long as no one made any\nchanges to a/b the server would service any requests for a/c's value from\na/b. Stores could do this for entire hierarchies using a single note to\nthemselves. Thus these stores could handle depth requests extremely\nefficiently. However if the requests were broken up into pieces, thus\nloosing the depth header semantics, then these powerful features were\nessentially useless.\n\nThe debate went on for over six months. It went on this long mostly because\nit was intertwined with the COPY/MOVE debate\n(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0300.html).\nThere were meetings, there were discussions, there were e-mails, it just\nkept on going around. Both sides were right, how did you decide? In the end\nHenry gave in, you will have to ask him why. Without Henry holding up the\n\"Depth is a bad idea\" side, the Depth header won by default.\n\nWhich brought up a problem. HTTP's request/response format is based on the\nidea that a request goes to a single resource and the response is scoped to\nthat resource. But in this case the request went to a single resource but\napplied to any number of resources. So we ended up re-inventing HTTP's\nresponse format inside of the XML multistatus response. It never occurred to\nanyone to have unmatched HTTP responses with sticky header/body. The\nPROPFIND wars\n(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1998OctDec/0302.html)\nwere well over by this point so once the Depth header got the o.k.\nmultistatus was a done deal.\n</Out of our Depth>\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15392214"}, {"subject": "(????)369biz???? ?????? ?????? ????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1541313"}, {"subject": "Re: FW: HTTP Design Issues, lessons from WebDAV's Property and Depth header experiences", "content": "Larry Masinter writes:\n\n>Despite the disclaimer about HTTP-NG in here, these seem like useful\n>design criteria for HTTP-NG.\n\nThanks to Larry for forwarding Yaron's HTTP design issues writeup.\n\nI'm a newcomer to this group, so forgive me if I'm resurrecting\nold arguments or restating the obvious, but several of Yaron's\ndesign issues reminded me of similar design considerations\nin the NFSv4 working group.\n\n1) Pipelining.\n\n   NFS clients use pipelining through the underlying RPC\n   protocol which acts as a MUX protocol.  The client can pump any number\n   of unacknowledged calls down the wire, and sort out the responses\n   (using the XID) of the replies that return.  Pipelining makes a huge\n   difference to I/O throughput through read-ahead and write-behind.\n\n   Pipelining by itself does not fix some of the latency problems built\n   into the protocol. For instance, to read a file you need to send\n   a LOOKUP request to get the filehandle, then send the filehandle\n   in a READ request to get the data.  That's two round-trips to get\n   data that HTTP can get in a single GET.\n\n   Our first thought was to create a new RPC procedure that combined\n   LOOKUP with READ.  Alas, this design trend leads to progressively\n   \"fatter\", more complex calls that get larded with more an more\n   options with the intent of getting the server to do more with a\n   single request.\n\n   Our current strawman design uses \"compound requests\" to fix the\n   latency problem (getting the server to do more with a single\n   request) while avoiding protocol bloat with arbitrarily complex\n   operations.  You define a small set of primitive operations that\n   can be combined to form more complex requests according to the\n   client's needs.  The server simply executes the primitive operations\n   in sequence until complete, or until one fails, then returns the\n   results in a single reply.  The only context we required was for\n   a filehandle that identifies the object that the primitive ops\n   are acting on.  The filehandle can be changed midway through\n   a compound request, so in theory a single request could act on multiple\n   objects. A compound request is not required to be idempotent or atomic,\n   which puts the onus on a client to limit its expectations of a\n   compound request based on the \"clean-up\" requirements if it fails\n   part-way.\n\n   For more info, see section 7. of the strawman protocol design:\n   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shepler-nfsv4-02.txt\n   There is also a requirements document at:\n   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-nfsv4-requirements-03.txt\n   or just go to our charter page:\n   http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/nfsv4-charter.html\n\n2) Byte Bloat and Relatedness.\n\n   Yaron describes issues with WebDAV's PROPFIND request.  I think some\n   of the relatedness issues tie back to compound requests, i.e. a\n   sequence of primitive operations that act within an object context.\n\n   For what it's worth, the NFSv4 strawman generalizes the way in\n   which we retrieve file attributes.  Previous NFS versions had\n   four different operations: GETATTR, FSSTAT, FSINFO, PATHCONF,\n   that each returned a pre-defined bundle of attributes.  We wanted\n   a more flexible model that allowed clients to select precisely\n   that attributes of interest.  We also wanted attribute requests\n   and responses to be compact, since NFS is a binary protocol built\n   on XDR marshalling of strings, binary integers, etc.\n   We settled on a single pair of calls to get/set attributes: GETATTR\n   and SETATTR.  These calls can act on multiple attributes, specified\n   in a bitmap.  The bitmap identifies the sequence of attribute values\n   that follows the bitmap.  The bitmap is nice for identifying the\n   attributes being requested or set. You can also query the object to\n   return the bitmap of supported attributes.  A compact representation\n   was important because clients seem to have an insatiable appetite for\n   file attributes, e.g. \"Get me the attributes for every object in this\n   directory.\"\n\n   Our current attribute proposal also includes provision for attributes\n   named by strings, though these are handled similarly to the \"named streams\"\n   in NTFS; an object can have named streams in the same way that\n   a directory can have file entries.  The protocol makes no effort to\n   standardize the names of these attributes.\n\nI'm intrigued by some of the similarities between HTTP and NFS.\nBoth protocols provide access to a hierarchy of files (HTTP calls\nthem \"documents\").  NFS treats the files as binary data, whereas\nHTTP conveys a lot more information on file content through MIME\ntype etc.  There's no doubt that you can do \"filesystem\" things\nwith HTTP, and \"web\" things with NFS or WebNFS, but I think it\nwould be unwise to design a protocol that would do both of these\nthings with the expectation that the filesystem clients and the\nweb clients would both be happy.  HTTP (and I hope  HTTP-NG) are\nmore feature-rich and aimed at browser-style use, whereas NFS\nis constrained by the filesystem APIs (POSIX and Win32) that are\nexpected to use it.\n\n$0.02\n\n        Brent\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15414382"}, {"subject": "FWD: I-D ACTION:draft-frystyk-httpng-overview-00.txt", "content": "There's a new Internet-Draft out, giving an opinion of what the HTTP-NG WG\nshould be doing.

Following are three answers.\n\n(1) It lets us tell a realistic story about field name collisions.  The\nextensible record type {a:A} admits values that have a \"b\" field with a\nnon-\"B\" value.  I have considered formally banishing such a possibility,\nby\nsaying that fields are identified not by simple names like \"b\" but by\nsome\nkind of global unique identifier that is always associated with exactly\none\ntype.  The idea is that every time you write a new subtype that adds\nfields, those fields have identifiers that are unique to the new\nsubtype.\nFor example, when Mark Andreeson extended HTTP/0.9's GET parameters with\na\nset of format preferences (supposing he did), he might have written the\nnew\nGET's parameter type like this:\n\n{ch.cern.gamma/tbl/http/0.9/url: String,\n edu.u-illinois.uc/~andreeson/accept: optional: Preferences}\n\nEven if someone else wanted to create a different extension with an\n\"accept\" parameter, the full ID of his field would be different.  There\nare\nmany different ways one can imagine creating the GUIDs for fields and\nmanaging their eternal association with exactly one type --- many of\nwhich\nare not entirely reliable (e.g., users just write these things down, and\nhave to be sure the change them whenever they change any detail\nreachable\nfrom a GUID).  Having a formal basis that admits the possibility of\nfield\nname collisions seems more appropriate for a world in which mistakes can\nhappen --- even though they're not supposed to occur in the normal case.\n\n(2) If extension doesn't make new types, then the types don't tell us\nmuch\nabout what's going on.  There are a number of ways in which types can be\nused as meta-data.  In just one current example, Jini's lookup service\nis\nbased on types.  If extended iterfaces didn't have new types, a Jini\ndirectory won't tell you which services are extended and which aren't.\nIn\ngeneral, there's a well established trend in software engineering to use\ntypes to convey information.  We *could* invent another \"facet\" of data\n(aside from \"types\") and use it to convey extension information; putting\nthat information in the types struck me as going a more familiar route.\n\n(3) Where extension and subtyping differ is at procedure types ---\nthat's\nnot something that can be changed even if we took different positions on\nthe above issues.  Recognizing that, you offered another framing of your\nquestion as something like \"is the point of extension that you use it\nwhen\nyou *want* invocations to fail?\".  I hestitate to agree, because coupled\nwith coarse types it lets you pass extended objects through third\nparties\n(and variables in programs) that won't be doing any invocations.\n\nMike Spreitzer <spreitze@parc.xerox.com>\nhttp://parcweb.parc/spreitze/ (Xerox internal)\nhttp://www.parc.xerox.com/spreitze/ (external)\n+1-650-812-4833\n\n\n\n   attached mail follows:\n     \n   \nFrom: \"Mike Spreitzer\" <spreitze@parc.xerox.com>\nTo: \"'John Lamping'\" <lamping@parc.xerox.com>\nCc: <abegel@cs.berkeley.edu>, <terry@parc.xerox.com>, <http-ng-parc@parc.xerox.\ncom>\nSubject: RE: Why should a forward&backward compatible change make a new type?\nDate: Sat, 24 Jul 1999 01:26:48 -0700\n\n\nLet me summarize where I think this discussion stands, and attempt to\nmove it forward a tiny bit.\n\nYou're proposing an alternate way of supporting evolution that doesn't\nrequire as much innovation in the type system.  Specifically, your\nproposal has: structural typing, extensible record types with two\n\"mode\" dimensions per field (\"optional/not\" and\n\"ignorable/not/dontCare\"), record values where each field is marked\n\"ignorable\" or not, and a belief that we can formally banish field\nname collision problems.  Your proposal does not have a new\n\"extension\" type relation, nor does it have coarse types.  Instead, it\nmakes do with subtyping, by the novel expedient of having client and\nserver use different types to describe the server.  Specifically, when\ntaking an evolutionary step, the server creates and uses to describe\nitself a subtype of its former type, while the client creates and uses\na supertype of the type it formerly used to describe its expectations\nof the server.  Your system has the charm that it has clients and\nservers describing themselves more precisely than the system I\nproposed.\n\nHere's a concrete (although unmotivated) example.  Both sides start\nwith a server type\n\n       T = {a:A} -> {x:X}\n\n(let me use a shorthand where a field is optional only if explicitly\nmarked so, and constrains the \"ignorable\" bit in the datum only if and\nhow explicitly marked).\n\nThe client has type\n\n    T -> Foo\n\nfor some unimportant type Foo.  To take a backward and forward\ncompatible step, the new server adopts type\n\n    S = {a:A, b:opt:B} -> {x:X, y:ign:Y}\n\nwhile the client adopts type\n\n      U -> Foo\n\nwhere\n\n        U = {a:A, b:ign:B} -> {x:X, y:opt:Y}\n\nPart of the key is the subtyping relation among record types, whose\nkey features are: (1) fields not mentioned in the record type must be\nmarked \"ignorable\" in the record value, and (2) adding an optional\nfield to a record type is purely an expansion (because of feature 1)\nof the set of acceptable values --- there is no contraction because of\na formal banishment of field naming collisions.\n\n(You suggest banishing field name collisions by making the record\ntyping rule say that a type mismatch at an optional field does not\nprevent the record value from having the considered record type.  I\ndon't favor that, as it seems rather sloppy; I'd rather take the\napproach of letting field names be GUIDs.  There may be problems with\nthat approach too --- what's The One True field type for a given field\nname in the presence of subtyping that restricts that field's type?\nMore thought is warranted on this issue.)\n\nThe upshot of your record typing rules are that\n\n    {a:A, c:ign:C} <: {a:A} <: {a:A, b:opt:B}\n\n(where \"<:\" means \"is a subtype of\").  For the example above, this\nmeans that:\n\n       S <: T <: U\n\nand\n\n        (U -> Foo) <: (T -> Foo)\n\nSo new servers can be used wherever old servers were expected, and new\nclients can be used wherever old clients were expected.\n\nNow let's work an example with less than complete forward/backward\ncompatability.  Let's add web-style per-request proxying:\n\n        PI = {to: T}\n        R = {a:A, pi:opt:PI} -> {x:X}\n\nThat is, a new server, having type R, is willing to entertain a\nrequest (via the optional \"pi\" field) to act as a proxy.  It's also\nwilling to not be a proxy.  OTOH, a new client expects the following\ntype of servers:\n\n        V = {a:A, pi:opt&~ign:PI} -> {x:X}\n\nThat is, the client reserves the right to supply or not supply a \"pi\"\nfield, but if it is supplied, it will be marked \"non-ignorable\".  Now,\nwhile R, like S, is a subtype of T, V is not a supertype of T.  That's\nbecause\n\n      {a:A, pi:opt&~ign:PI}\n\nis not a subtype of\n\n   {a:A}\n\n(rather, it's a supertype).\n\nThus, while a new server can be used by an old client, an old server\ncannot be used by a new client (for all possible requests from new\nclients).  Which is in fact an accurate reflection of what\ncombinations work (for all possible requests).  However, this starts\nto make me nervous, as it runs up against the third reason I gave for\nthe design I proposed: the ability to pass an extended server around\nthrough static places that won't make an invocation that would\ndiscover the mismatch.\n\nSeeking an example that illustrates the problem, consider what happens\nwhen the client asks the proxy to talk to an extended server (e.g.,\nextended as in the S/U example above)?  The client expects the proxy\nto have type W:\n\n     W = {a:A, pi:opt&~ign:PJ} -> {x:X, y:opt:Y}\n\nfor some PJ that we'll try to discern.  You might expect to write\n\n    PJ = {to:U},\n\nbut we'll see that won't work.  Supposing the actual proxy has type R,\nwe need R to be a subtype of W (so the newest client can use the\nproxy).  For that to be so, we need\n\n   {a:A, pi:opt&~ign:PJ} <: {a:A, pi:opt:PI}.\n\nTo get that, we need PJ <: PI (maybe the field name collision issue\nresolution interferes here, need to be careful about that).  Now, PJ\nwill have the form {to:Q}, for some origin server type Q.  To get PJ\n<: PI, we need Q <: T.  Q=U doesn't work, because U isn't a subtype of\nT.  A solution for Q <: T is Q=S.  And if you think about it, that's\nnot unreasonable: it means the newest client expects the proxy to be\nwilling to be told to forward the request to an S.  Hmm, no bad\nexample here.  But it does illustrate how tricky it is to reason about\nthis stuff.  OTOH, maybe it's reasoning that would have to be done\nwith my proposed system too (just without as much \"compiler\" support).\nAt the end of our meeting a couple weeks ago, you and Bill were\nsuggesting a way to ease the reasoning burden, but I haven't yet\nunderstood what you were trying to suggest.

If the goals aren't as well understood\nas people thought, then the goals document will expose this, and save time.\nIt seems to me the existing WebMUX I-D has a good start on the goals\ndocument -- you'd just need to add rationale for each of the goals items.\n\nIt also looks like the existing WebMUX I-D has, near the end, a good start\ntowards a design rationale document.

You'll see documentation like you'\nve suggested appearing in early drafts of the HTTP-NG charter.  As we progresse\nd on drafting the charter, we got to thinking it would be included in the MUX s\npec (as design rationale) rather than broken out into a separate document.

TCP's flow-control machinery includes both sender-side restraint (AKA slo\nw-start) and reciever-given restraint (the windowing explicit on the wire).  Th\ne mux needs the latter (at least for applications where you expect some real in\ndependence of the message streams), but not the former.  The sender-side restra\nint is there to avoid flooding the network, and TCP will do that for us even wi\nth a mux above it.\n\nNote that the charter isn't explicit on this point.  I anticipate the WG to deb\nate this, and decide that the reciever-given restraint in the mux layer should\nbe an optional module, because some applications will need it and some won't.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15584132"}, {"subject": "RE: Drafting mux WG charter", "content": "I dont think that the authors of the charter truly intend\nto \"punt all security\".\n\nIt seems to me that a reasonable MUX effort can get underway\nand provide good security.\n\nObviously, the group needs to keep security considerations in mind\nand will have some serious work ahead of them beyond just\nthe security issue.

Too many WGs have left security as an afterthought and\nhad their output delayed months or years as a result.

Firewalls rely on knowing where traffic is\ngoing. A MUXed protocol is likely to require inspection of every byte to\ndo this, or at least, reconstruction of the stream, if it is to be\nnoticably different from using multiple connections. This will make\nfirewalling almost impossible in hardware, and resource-intensive in all\ncircumstances. In turn, this means that it is likely to be banned from\nmost applications, which means that doing it is a waste of time.\n\nCheers,\n\nBen.\n\n--\nhttp://www.apache-ssl.org/ben.html\n\n\"My grandfather once told me that there are two kinds of people: those\nwho work and those who take the credit.

A single\nmultiplexed connection (similar to MEMUX) with strict priorities and\nround-robin within same priorities (dissimilar to MEMUX) is used such that\nfirst the HTML is sent, then all visible images on the page (i.e. not\nscrolled off the screen) are simultaneously sent and then finally off-screen\nimages.  Link bandwidth can be further directed by placing the mouse cursor\nin images of interest giving those images highest priority.  This scheduling\npolicy, especially when combined progressive image coding and HTML\ncompression can result in a significant reduction in the time to deliver\ncontent (very roughly 2-5x depending on web page and metrics.) A more complete\ndescription can be found in an Infocom'99 paper:\nhttp://infopad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~gilbertj/JMG_INFOCOM99.pdf\n\n        While I realize that there are important complexity concerns that\nmotivated the decision to layer on top of a reliable protocol as well as omit\nprioritization, I wanted to make the cases for their consideration.\n\n1) Prioritization\n        A web page can contain many objects - images, scripts, css, etc -\nhowever only the on-screen images effect loading time perceived by the\nuser.  (As images are scrolled on-screen, they have to be given higher\npriority.)  If HTTP/1.0-style loading is used, off-screen images will\nbe loaded during the same time period that on screen images are loaded and\nthus extend the time to load onscreeen images.  Using MEMUX where all objects\nwere transfered simultaneously would be even worse than HTTP/1.0 from this\nperspective (for large pages at least).  A similar case can be made for\nprioritizing all HTML (or at least on-screen HTML if the browser could\nmake the distinction) above all images - the HTML is used format the page\nand contains refs to images and it is thus good to load it first.  Additionally\nit is in a sense the \"coarsest\" layer of the page - with just the text much of\nthe semantic content is available.  Also tables often require all of their\nHTML before rendering can occur.\n\n        While a pipelined approach such as HTTP/1.1 effectively prioritizes\nHTML over on-screen images over off-screen images, it, of course, has the\ndisadvantage that image meta-data is delayed and most of the benefits of\nprogressive images are also lost well (my paper goes into depth on this.)\n\n        What I would propose would be a strict-priority system\nAlthough the MEMUX protocol would honor priorities, the assignment\nof priorities would, of course, be done by the browser for the web\napplication and other applications could prioritize in any manner they\nplease.  The same generic prioritization scheme could also be used to implement\ncontrol/data etc.  I just used a simple strict-priority round-robin with\nties going to whichever channel had sent less data so far though I am\nsure that many other good schemes exist.  Priority can be sent upon\nopening the channel and through explicit reprioritization messages though\npriority info is not sent normal data messages.\n\n        I noticed that the SMUX section under priorities mentioned a potential\nproblem of denial of service attacks with priorities - if someone could\nelaborate on that, I would appreciate it.  I was assuming that a single SMUX\nconnection would be used by one application or user/entity.  In the case\nof the web, one connection between browser/server or browser proxy.  If\nmultiple distinct users were to share, it might make sense to do a hierarchical\nsystem either explicitly or implicitly by having a master MEMUX session\nmultiplexing users (with whatever high-level inter-user prioritization that\nwas desired) and then each of the channels of this master MEMUX session could\nbe MEMUX sessions themselves with the priorities set by the applcation.  That\nway each user/application could control how they allocated their bandwidth\nalthough they could not effect other users any more than their share of\nconnections.  Though I have not given this much thought...\n\n2) Intra-layer retransmission and scheduling\n\n        While this one is dangerously close to the first \"Out-Of-Scope\" item,\nperhaps if people find value in it, an in-scope variant could be devised.\n\n        Basically the charter explicitly states that MEMUX is to be\nimplemented over another reliable protocol such as TCP.  While this is\ncertainly good from a complexity standpoint, I believe it has at least\ntwo disadvantages:\n\n        2a) Introduction of false-dependancies (definitely)\n        2b) Increased scheduling latencies (probably)\n\n2a) Introduction of false-dependancies\n        If retransmission takes place at a layer below the MEMUX layer,\nand a packet is dropped, then this will be detected at that lower layer and\nthe lower layer will have to delay the reconstruction of its data stream\nuntil all missing packets are filled in.  Thus all MEMUX \"channels\" are delayed\n.\nHowever, if the dropped packet did not contain data from a given channel, then\nthere is no need to delay that channel while preserving its end-to-end channel\nbyte stream.  Thus the layering upon a reliable byte stream makes the streams\nfalsely depend on each other in a retransmission sense.  While this will\nnot effect the total amount of time to complete a bulk transfer on the\nchannels, it could increase the latency to receive parts of the data.  This\nis particularly important for interactive operation over lossy and/or\nhigh-latency links (a prime example being web access over wireless links).\nAdditionally, during connection restart after an idle time, when latency\nis most sensitive since the HTML is transfered, I believe that packet loss\ndue to congestion would occur more as the link capacity is determined.\n\n        The web application over MEMUX is a great example of an interactive\napplication (i.e. needs low latency) which can very naturally take advantage\nof the substream model since each object or image is independant of others.\nIf each channel's reliability was kept independant (i.e. MEMUX handles\nretransmission) then it could tolerate a high packet loss rate while still\nachieving progress.\n\n        Additionally it would seem that the remote invocation layer of the\nthree layer http-ng would also benefit from error decopling as then\nseparate remote invocations would be kept independant.\n\n        The charter states \"(2) the multiplexing achieves the same results as\nstate sharing between parallel TCP streams (which is not widely available\ntoday)\" - please correct me if I am wrong but if MEMUX is layered on a\nreliable link, packet losses would cause delay of all streams in the MEMUX\ncase but not in the parallel state-shared TCP stream case.  However if it\nMEMUX performed retransmission then this would not be a problem.  Additionally,\n\nMEMUX could gain a performance advantage (as stated in the charter) in terms\nof eliminating new channel round-trip time, ability to merge multiple small\nchunks of data on separate substreams into a single IP packet, and possibly\nprioritization (below).  Thus if MEMUX performed its own retransmission then\nit would would seem to be a win over multiple TCP connections while if it does\nnot then it would be superior in some aspects yet inferior in others.\n\n        One could imagine the MEMUX API being independant of whether MEMUX\nwas layered on top of a reliable transport or performed retransmission (and\nunfortunately also congestion control as well) and intial implementations\ncould be layered on TCP while later ones would not and thus the same\napplications could be reused but just obtain higher performance with the\nsecond version of MEMUX.\n\n        I should point out that while I have implemented the modified delivery\nsystem with prioritization, I have currently only layered it on top of TCP/IP\nand have not run experiments to determine the gains of performing retransmissio\nn\n(and congestion control, etc.) explicitly.  The added complexity of\nreimplementing much of TCP is certainly something to contend with.\n\n        2b) Increased scheduling latencies (probably)\n\n        One problem that I have encountered due to implementing interactive\nweb delivery over TCP is that the latency from when the user requests a change\nin prioritization to when they see the new data is the sum of the data in the\nnetwork and the data in the sender's (web server/proxy's) TCP kernel buffers.\n(Actually the data in the web browser side kernel buffers would also be an\nissue but typically they are fairly empty.)  This is because the multiplexing\noccurs before the enqueing of the data and the highest priority data at the\ntime that the data is transfered into the TCP buffers might not be the\nhighest priority data at the time that the data is sent from the TCP buffers\nover the network.  If it were defered into the kernel and happened shortly\nbefore transmission into the network then delay frmo user action to response\nwould only be determined by the amount of data in the network and not the\nkernel buffers.  However, I would imagine that there could be performance\nissues associated with performing the multiplexing in the kernel.  (Could\nsomeone with experience in kernel network code comment?)\n\n        Those are just some thoughts - I know that many issues have to be\ntraded off - any comments would be welcomed!

We now have a tentative BOF\nslot in Minneapolis:\n\nAPPLCORE has tentatively been scheduled as follows:\n\n        Monday, March 15 at 1300-1500\n                other groups scheduled at that time:\n                        ion, rmonmib, idr, ipsec, megaco, ippm, uswg\n-----\nI'm working on a detailed agenda for the BOF feel free to post suggested\ntopics.  Here's the proposed charter I drafted, which will be discussed at\nthe BOF:\n\n-----\nApplication core protocol WG  (APPLCORE)\n\nThe IETF has traditionally developed application protocols directly on\ntop of a raw TCP stream.  However, there is a growing set of problems\nwhich many application protocols have to solve regardless of what the\nprotocols do.  This WG will identify the common problems that deployed\nIETF protocols have solved, identify the successes and failures that\ndeployed IETF protocols made when addressing these problems and design\na simple core protocol to address these problems.  This core protocol\nmay then be used by future application protocols to simplify both the\nprocess of protocol design and the complexity of implementing\nmulti-protocol clients or servers.\n\nIn order to keep the WG in focus, the following items are explicitly\nout-of-scope:\n\n* Backwards compatibility with existing application protocols\n  Backwards compatibility often compromises correct design.  If this\n  WG is successful it will impact a great number of future protocols,\n  and thus the design errors which backwards compatibility might\n  dictate must be avoided.\n\n* Transport layers other than TCP/IP\n  This has been a rathole in too many other WGs.\n\n* Protocol models outside the traditional IETF client-server TCP\n  application protocol model.\n  The IETF doesn't have sufficient past experience in these areas.\n\n* New features\n  If a problem hasn't been solved in at least two deployed IETF\n  application protocols, then it is out-of-scope for the base core\n  protocol spec.  This does not preclude individuals or other groups\n  from doing extensions to the core protocol which might be used by\n  multiple future application protocols; it just limits the scope of\n  the core spec.\n\n* Normative references to other application protocols or non-public specs\n  The core protocol has to stand by itself.  It may reference protocol\n  building blocks that have been used by several other application\n  protocols such as ABNF, language tags, UTF-8, domain names, URLs,\n  MIME, SASL, GSSAPI and TLS.  It must avoid normative references to\n  full application protocols such as ACAP, HTTP, IMAP, LDAP, and SMTP.\n  It must avoid normative references to any document which is not\n  freely and publicly available on the Internet.\n\nThe WG will produce the following output:\n\n* An RFC documenting the problems identified to solve, and giving\n  examples of existing deployed IETF protocols which succeeded or made\n  mistakes when solving those problems.  A starting list of problems\n  for the WG to discuss (the WG may choose not to address some of\n  these) follows:\n\n  * connection user authentication and privacy (e.g., SASL and STARTTLS)\n  * server capability/extension announcement (e.g., SMTP EHLO)\n  * extensible command/response syntax and structure\n  * error status tokens and human readable error text issues\n  * syntax for transfer of large (multi-line) objects (e.g., dot-stuffing,\n    length counting, chunking)\n  * multiple commands in progress at the same time (command ids or tags)\n  * unsolicited server messages\n  * command pipelining (sending multiple commands without waiting for\n    responses)\n  * Structured data representation (e.g., RFC 822-style AV pairs, IMAP\n    s-expressions, LDAP ASN.1, XDR, etc) in command/response syntax.\n  * low bandwidth support (e.g., compression layer or packed binary\n    protocol encoding)\n  * connection shutdown (QUIT/LOGOUT command)\n\n* A simplicity litmus test to determine if a proposal is acceptably\n  simple.  The initial litmus test will be: core protocol spec is less\n  than 25 pages.\n\n* A standards track core application protocol specification which uses\n  the lessons learned from the informational document and fits the\n  litmus test above.  An open source implementation of the complete\n  core protocol must exist prior to IETF last call.  The problem\n  identification draft (above) must be completed prior to IETF last\n  call.\n\nThe WG may solicit strawmen for the core application protocol from\nmultiple document editors and select the one which is technically\nbest and fits this charter.\n\nThe WG may choose to do additional standards track documents which\nextend the core protocol as long as they are not new features by the\nabove definition.\n\nThe WG may choose to do one or more APIs for using the core protocol\nand adding commands/extensions to it.  These might be informational\nor standards track as deemed appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------- End of Forwarded Message ---------------\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15796849"}, {"subject": "FWD: SLUMS BOF", "content": "FYI\n\n---------------- Forwarded  Message ----------------------\n\nReceived: from alpha.xerox.com ([13.1.64.93]) by louise.parc.xerox.com with SMT\nP id <358855>; Sun, 28 Feb 1999 10:03:35 PST\nReceived: from daffy.ee.lbl.gov ([131.243.1.31]) by alpha.xerox.com with SMTP i\nd <52081(4)>; Sun, 28 Feb 1999 10:03:28 PST\nReceived: (from vern@localhost)\n        by daffy.ee.lbl.gov (8.9.2/8.9.2) id KAA11122;\n        Sun, 28 Feb 1999 10:03:26 -0800 (PST)\nMessage-Id: <199902281803.KAA11122@daffy.ee.lbl.gov>\nTo: ruts@lbl.gov\nSubject: SLUMS BOF for addressing RUTS requirements\nCc: srini@watson.ibm.com, hari@lcs.mit.edu, spreitze@parc.xerox.com\nDate: Sun, 28 Feb 1999 10:03:26 PST\nFrom: Vern Paxson <vern@ee.lbl.gov>\nX-UIDL: a3500b3e71e943e75d96aefa9dec3412\nStatus: U\n\nThere will be a BOF at the next IETF called SLUMS (= Support for Lots\nof Unicast Multiplexed Sessions) that will explore possible transport\nsolutions to addressing a subset of the requirements that came out of\nthe RUTS BOF at the last IETF.  SLUMS is tentatively scheduled for\nWednesday (3/17) afternoon, 1PM-3PM.\n\nThe subset of the requirements we're picturing as in scope for SLUMS is:\n\n    - quick establishment/activation, which is in tension with security\n      considerations (authentication, flooding - not holding state)\n\n    - support for application level framing:\n        - control over reliability (e.g., setting time limits on how\n          long to try to deliver a message)\n        - the ability to supercede previous application messages\n\n    - minimize state requirements; think of servers with 1e6 connections\n\n    - muxing: PDUs muxed, delivered ASAP.  Want ACK aggregation across\n      the different communication streams; isolated flow-control; QoS\n      consciousness between the streams.\n\n    - congestion control across multiple communication streams\n\n    - reducing slow start delays for multiple communication streams\n\n    - failover: transport connection can survive across change in IP address\n        - on connection attempt, SYN timeout are viewed as expensive\n        - mid-stream, need to switch to backup interfaces\n\n    - ability for application to indicate \"a reply is coming\" versus\n      \"no more coming now, go ahead and ack, don't delay\"\n\nAnd the ones that are not in scope:\n\n    - support for application level framing:\n        - visibility into network conditions\n        - want to deal with transport at a 'frame' granularity (record marking)\n        - per-message priority control\n\n    - congestion control\n        - slow start hit (bursty vs. even flow)\n        - snappy after idle (bursty vs. even flow)\n        - optionally becoming aggressive during loss (for control traffic\n          whose job is to stem the congestion); e.g., FEC\n\n    - small footprint\n\nThe goal of the BOF is to explore different basic approaches for addressing\nthese requirements.  All of the proposed approaches deal primarily with the\nmuxing requirement, ensuring that multiple communication threads between two\nhosts obey the fundamental congestion control principles.  Addressing the\nother requirements is generally deferred to higher-layer solutions, which\nstrikes us as a good way to divide up the problem.\n\nSrini Seshan will discuss an approach that he, Hari Balakrishnan, and\ncolleagues have developed called the \"Congestion Manager\" (CM).  The basic\nidea is that a host's different communication streams use a CM service to\ndetermine when they can send and at what rate.  The CM is described in\nthe paper \"An Integrated Congestion Management Architecture for Internet\nHosts\", available from\n\n        http://inat.lcs.mit.edu/papers/BRS99.ps\n\nPlease read this document if you have a chance - it's a very interesting\nframework that has little overhead (none in the case of managing multiple\nTCP connections).\n\nMike Spreitze will discuss MEMUX, which has come out of the HTTP-NG muxing\nwork.  MEMUX operates above the transport layer, multiplexing a set of\ncommunication streams on top of a single transport connection.\n\nWe may also have advocates for integrating congestion control across\nmultiple TCP streams.  One can then implement lightweight communication\nstreams using multiple T/TCP connections.\n\n- Vern & Scott\n\n\n\n---------------- End of Forwarded Message ---------------\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-008-15806832"}, {"subject": "More lessons from DAV", "content": "At WWW7 last year, Rohit, Henrik and I organized a workshop on the future of\nHTTP, and presentations and position papers from the workshop can be found\nat:\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/httpng/\n\nSince it is closely related to Yaron's \"lessons from DAV\" post that was\nforwarded by Larry, I want to point out a position paper I wrote for this\nworkshop titled, \"Lessons from WebDAV for the Next Generation Web\nInfrastructure\".

Suppose\nwe layer the \"mailcap\" protocol on top of APPLCORE.  Should mailcap also\ndo web browsing?  No.  I'd conclude \"web browsing\" isn't part of the core.\nFurthermore, most of the negative comments on this charter think it's\nstill too broad, so adding \"web browsing\" would be a step in the wrong\ndirection.\n\nHowever, I'd have no problem with the HTTP-NG team independently layering\na web browsing application on APPLCORE in addition to being active\nparticipants of the APPLCORE work.\n\n> The HTTP-NG working group proposed charter wasn't accepted as\n> proposed, and the intent seems to be to create two working groups:\n> one in transport, to focus on the transport related issues, and\n> one in APPS, to focus on the problem of creating an 'application\n> core'.

There are others who would like to see\nother things emphasized, and for whom XML-based marshalling, for instance,\nis more trouble than it's worth.

Successful systems often\nstart out as small, simple things.  But as they succeed and grow in scope\nand ambition, initial trade-offs between simplicity and power become\ninappropriate, and a switch to more powerful underpinnings becomes\ndesirable.

The internet draft has expired and needs\nupdating to bring into line with current practice. The performance is\nwidely perceived to be poor, particularly for modem users, and various\ngroups are working on disparate approaches for adding security and payment\nmechanisms.\n\nLeft to itself, we will get fragmented de facto standards that inhibit\ninteroperability. Even if one company wins out as the dominant supplier\nof servers and clients, it will act as a bottleneck for change with\nnegative effects for end-users and value-adding niche suppliers.\n\nThe role of W3O and the IETF should be to facilitate the development of\nopen standards in which everyone can gain. To achieve this we will need\nto take advantage of the best work whether it is done at academic research\ncenters or by commercial developers.\n\nInternet drafts and RFCs offer a route for nailing down an open framework for\nthe protocol and for standard APIs for plug-in modules. This will facilitate\ninteroperability by encouraging re-use of security modules rather than, for\nexample, forcing every developer to separately negotiate with RSA for rights\nto use public key algorithms, or with the Department of Commerce for export\nlicenses. Acting together, we can get better deals.\n\nOur suggested focus is on the short term. In particular, we want:\n\n    a)  to tap into the 30% of US homes with PCs/Macs and provide\n        the incentives for them to connect to the Web\n\n    b)  to make it easy to pay for goods and services on the Web\n\n    c)  to protect the copyright interests of information providers\n\nTo meet these objectives, we need to build on existing work and scale\nour action plan to what is feasible in the short term.\n\n\nSecurity and Electronic Payments\n--------------------------------\n\nThe suggested timetable for this is to first concentrate on what is needed\nto securely send order details and receipts. Credit card payments can be\nauthenticated offline by the credit card companies, but the next step is\nto provide support for authenticating servers, and subsequently clients.\nBasic authentication is possible using the IP address. Other mechanisms\ninclude Kerberos, and public key certificates. We shouldn't overlook\nencryption of arbitrary HTTP requests and responses.\n\nSmart cards have a bright future for payments based on credit/debit models\nand digital cash. In the short term, no one has card readers and we need\nto consider how to get things off the ground. In transitioning from here\nto there, we need to make it very simple for end-users and financial\ninstitutions. Some of the issues this raises include: how users register\nwith an authentication server; if public key mechanisms are used, who\ngenerates the public key/secret key pairs and certificates; do the credit\ncard companies store the certificate information as well; and are the\ntransactions themselves are protected for both secrecy and integrity?\n\nMosaic Communications, EIT, Spyglass and CERN all have different approaches\nto this! The working group will need to come up with an open framework that\nsupports a range of different approaches. Could we agree on using a standard\nheader to indicate which approach is in use, and to indicate acceptable\nalternatives? Can we agree on a high level set of security mechanisms and an\nAPI for implementing them with a range of cryptographic techniques? Is there\nany role here for the GSS API?\n\n\nImproved Performance\n--------------------\n\nIt may prove worthwhile to extend MIME for use with an improved HTTP.\nSwitching to a binary encoding of the protocol headers will not of its\nown give us the performance we desire, but many of the weak spots in the\ncurrent protocol have been repeatedly discussed on the mailing lists.\n\nWe would like to see one or more Internet Drafts covering:\n\n    -   MGET and multipart messages\n\nThe ability to request several objects in the same request. The\nobjects are then returned as a multipart message.\n\n    -   keep-alive and segmented transfers\n\nThis gives us the ability to get an HTML file and then request the\ninlined images reusing the same connection.\n\n    -   encouraging deployment of transaction TCP\n\nRecent proposals cut out the slow start up times of conventional\nTCP protocol stacks. Can we coordinate our efforts to promote the\nwidespread adoption of these extensions to TCP?\n\n    -   ways to avoid long lists of Accept headers\n        and to better specify client capabilities\n\nRight now Mosaic sends out long lists of Accept headers which could easily\nbe replaced by more compact identifiers for standard configurations. For\nhome users with standard VGA and slow modems, it would be great if servers\ncould take advantage of this to send more compact images.\n\n    -   consideration of an ASN.1 based format\n\nWe need to look at the advantages of switching to a binary encoded format\nfor protocol headers.\n\n\nSuggested Workplan\n------------------\n\nOctober '94:\n    We meet in Chicago and seek agreement that a common\n    framework is needed for security and payment mechanisms,\n    as well as brainstorming the problems/issues that the\n    framework should address. We agree a numbering scheme\n    for subsequent HTTP releases, and get interested people\n    to sign-up to take an active role.\n\nNovember '94:\n    Work starts on a revised Internet Draft covering HTTP as in\n    current use. The http-wg mailing list may be appropriate for\n    exchanging detailed comments on this document as it is written.\n\n    We use the www-security mailing list to continue brainstorming\n    ideas on the common security framework. One or more people\n    nominated at the October BOF write this up as an initial draft.\n\n    The objective for November is to finalize the charter and initial\n    workplan for the IETF working group. The group uses the http-wg\n    mailing list to work together on this document.\n\nDecember '94:\n    IETF HTTP WG BOF - we present the charter and workplan. This meeting\n    should be used to build the consensus and to look forward to the next\n    set of actions and milestones.

I was thinking of a different kind of copyright protection, namely\na technological approach like document marking.

I don't see how we can preserve privacy using a\nbilling model for payment.\n2) Caching proxy servers help obscure identity (to the information service\nprovider).\n3) I can imagine proxy TCP services that establish connections in a way\nanalogous to the anonymous reEmailers in Finland.  These would obscure\nthe original requester.\n\nNote the effect that (2) and (3) have on IP address authentication!\n\n  > \n  > >> We agree a numbering scheme for subsequent HTTP releases,\n  > \n  > > The numbering scheme may be premature -- it may depend on who gets what\n  > > done (and accepted by the community) first.\n  > \n  > When we produce the revised Internet Draft that describes current practise\n  > we will almost certainly want to change the version number in some way.\n  > That would do for now!\n  > \n  > > What I mean is this:  after people agree on the state of current practice,\n  > > folks will go off in different directions that, I hope, are largely\n  > > orthogonal:  performance improvement, security, payment.

Let me be pedantic and note that digital cash is not a security\nextension (at least in my book) but a payment extension.  That said, I\nagree that we should be working toward a framework that allows\ncompatible extensions to HTTP.\n[...]\n  > > Describing current practice may be possible by Spring '95.

I think you and I are agreeing that\nwe want to define a framework in which all these things can co-exist.  The\nWG would define the framework, not necessarily the specific extensions.\n\nDavid M.

The reason for this is that a message is often to be posted to\none or more mailing lists, one or more news groups and maybe a remote\nHTTP server. I have described how I would like the client interface to\nthe Library of Common Code when building what I call a POST-Web at\n\n   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/User/Features/ClientPost.html\n\nIf the client is capable of talking directly to all the remote servers\nthen this causes no problem for the HTTP protocol. However, if the POST\nrequest is going through a Proxy server, the current POST concept is\ninadequate.

I bet we could get one of our web-crawler\nauthors to add to his crawling algorithm a measure of the ratio of \ninlined-images-on-same-site to inlined-images-off-site, and that it \nwould probably be something on the order of 20-1, if not 100-1.

Add a header to the client request that indicates the hostname and\n   port of the URL which the client is accessing.\n\nRationale:  One of the most requested features from commercial server\nmaintainers is the ability to run a single server on a single port\nand have it respond with different top level pages depending on the\nhostname in the URL.  Service providers would like to have multiple\naliases for a single host and have URLs like\n\nhttp://company1.com/, http://company2.com/, http://company3.com/\n\nall return appropriate (and different) pages even though all the\nhostnames refer to the same IP address.  This is not currently possible\nbecause there is no way for the server to know the hostname in the\nURL by which it was accessed.\n\n\n2. Require (or request) that clients support relative URL's in \n   redirects (status 301 and 302).\n\nRationale: This is important for small special purpose servers\n(e.g. gateways).  Such a server is simpler to write, more robust, and\nmore portable if it doesn't need to know its hostname or port.  At present\nthere are two reasons a server needs to know its hostname and port.\nFirst if it supports CGI it is required to supply this information\nand second for sending 301 and 302 redirects.  Normally a small special\npurpose server would not support CGI and wouldn't send redirects.\nHowever, in order to use relative URL's, a server must deal with\nrequests like  \n\nGET /dir1/dir2   \nwhich should be \nGET /dir1/dir2/\n\ni.e. with trailing '/'.  The accepted (and perhaps only) way of handling\nthis is with a redirect from the first to the second.  Since clients\nmust handle relative URL's anyway there is little cost in having them\nhandle them in redirects.  On the other hand the cost for special purpose\nservers of needing to know both their hostname and port is significant.\n\n\nJohn Franks Dept of Math.

An alias name in the DNS for a\ncomputer has very little to do with Web servers or HTTP. There is NO change\nneeded to HTTP request syntax to accomodate this. As I said before, clients\nare going to need to send the info to the server one way or another. My\nproposal is that they adopt a standard HTTP header field that specifies the\ncomplete remote URL used to access the server.\n\nSince there will be a mix of clients, some supporting host name reporting\nand some not, it just doesn't matter how this info gets to the server.\nSince it doesn't matter, the easier to implement solution is a new HTTP\nrequest header field. It allows all clients and servers to operate as they\ndo now with NO code changes. Clients and servers that actually need host\nname information can have tiny mods made to send the extra header field\ncontaining the URL and process it.\n\nLeave the standard alone on this issue. It is robust enough to do what you\nwant using the mechanisms built into it now without completely convoluting\nthe syntax of a request.\n\nCompanies will still be able to use whatever domain name they want and\nservers will get a LOT more info than just the host name with this scheme.\nIn any case, the client must conform to a new standard, whatever it is, or\nthis won't work. All I'm suggesting is that there is a better way to\nimplement the delivery of host name info to the server that doesn't involve\nhacking the request syntax and can be backwards compatible with ALL clients\nand servers.\n\nFrom-URL: http://host.name/file/path/info.html\n\n--_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\\_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\nChuck Shotton                             \\\nAssistant Director, Academic Computing     \\   \"Shut up and eat your\nU. of Texas Health Science Center Houston   \\    vegetables!!!\"\ncshotton@oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu  (713) 794-5650 \\\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\\-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16266868"}, {"subject": "[????]????(??) ???? ?????? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ???? ????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1627339"}, {"subject": "Re: Two proposals for HTTP/2.", "content": "> >Everything you say is true from a technical point of view.

It is identical to the technique used by\nsome C programs to examine argv[0] and perform different behaviors (serve\ndifferent home pages in the WWW case) based on the name, like\ncompress/uncompress or sendmail/newalias. But instead of using the name of\na program to determine behavior on a host, admins want to use the name of a\nhost to determine behavior of a single server (with multiple names).\n\nThis is a legitimate technique to use. I just question the logic behind\naltering the syntax of HTTP requests when other mechanisms exist.\n\nThe real issue is that if clients don't send the name, servers have no way\nof knowing which of many names was used to contact the server. SO, clients\nultimately have to support sending this info. Since clients need to change,\nthere will be a non-trivial period of time where some clients support the\nnew method (whatever that may be) and some don't. In order to ease the\ntransition (strictly from a software developers' perspective), the servers\nshould easily be able to accomodate requests from both types of clients.\n\nThe best way to do this is to try and leave the ways that clients\ncommunicate with servers relatively untouched and enhance the amount of\ninfo sent from client to server using features in the HTTP protocol\ndesigned for this purpose. Namely, HTTP request header fields. New clients\nwill send the field, old clients won't. New servers will understand the\nfield, old servers won't. New clients will still be able to talk to old\nservers with the SAME syntax, and old clients can talk to new servers, too.\n\nChanging the request syntax to include a full URL will preclude NEW clients\nbeing able to talk to OLD servers. The client has NO way of knowing whether\nor not the server it is about to talk to can understand HTTP/2.0 until it\ntalks to it. This is the single biggest reason to avoid radical changes to\nthe syntax for the request. I don't know of any servers now that break if\nthey get a HTTP request header field that they don't understand. But I bet\nevery one of them will fail if they get a complete URL in a GET request.\n\n>I _think_ this is currently done at a few sites with a feature of\n>the BSD ifconfig that allows one interface to accept traffic on\n>multiple IP addresses on one interface, then hacking the server\n>to serve up different web pages for the different IP addresses.\n\nThis is different than using CNAMEs and doesn't present the same problem\nsince you DO know which ip address was contacted and can equate this\ndirectly to a host name. It also isn't widely supported on many Unix\nworkstations. Another thing to consider is that a VAST majority of Web\nservers aren't even being run on Unix servers. There are MANY, MANY more\nservers running on PCs and Macs than Unix. So continuing to adopt a\nUnix-centric approach to implementing new HTTP features is not necessarily\nthe best idea.\n\n>It's an ugly hack, but there is a demand. I personally doubt this\n>can be \"fixed\" in the HTTP protocol because of the problem of supporting\n>old clients, and because this is, in effect, trying to subvert the meaning\n>of the DNS in the context of URLs.\n\nIn so far as the HTTP protocol equates to the actual request/response\nmethod syntax, I agree. However, there is an unlimited ability to modify\nclient and server interaction using other parts of the request/response\ndata (the header fields).\n\n--_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\\_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\nChuck Shotton                             \\\nAssistant Director, Academic Computing     \\   \"Shut up and eat your\nU. of Texas Health Science Center Houston   \\    vegetables!!!\"\ncshotton@oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu  (713) 794-5650 \\\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\\-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16285777"}, {"subject": "Re: Two proposals for HTTP/2.", "content": "I think allowing\n\nGET url HTTP/2.0\n\nmakes sense just in terms of cleaning up the protocol, independently\nof the motivation of helping people who want to serve maultiple\nhost-names from the same host.\n\nServers don't really need to know their own names, as much as they\nneed to be able to discover their own addresses, and, after doing the\nname lookup on a new hostname first ask \"is this me?\".

Servers will\n>also need some way to discover their own port, though.\n\nThis is only true of servers on Unix implemented to run under inet. It\nisn't the case on any other server on any other platform including\nstand-alone Unix servers, because these servers already know what port they\nare listening on.\n\nServers DO need to know host name and port info so they can pass it to CGI\napplications which may need to generate self-referencing URLs. They just\ndon't need to find it out by forcing a wholesale change on the way clients\nmake requests to the server.\n\nImagine all of the software that will have to change, from clients and\nservers to dedicated scripts, applications, etc., if the syntax of a GET\nrequest changes to require a complete URL. Information contained in the URL\nis redundant, given that servers already know their IP address, the\nprotocol they are communicating with, and the port number.\n\nThe ONLY missing piece of information is something that has NOTHING to do\nwith HTTP, HTML, or the WWW and everything to do with some strictly\ncommercial needs - namely the actual DNS name that was used to access the\nserver. As I said before, using the domain name to determine server\nfunction may (or may not) be considered a hack, but it doesn't really have\nanything to do with HTTP, per se. It has to do with some configuration\n\"tricks\" that some server administrators feel they need to do to make\ncustomers happy. I'm all for that, but I think that the appropriate\nmechanism should be chosen and munging the HTTP request syntax isn't it.\n\nBottom line is that it would be a lot easier to look for a new request\nheader field than to have to add a bunch of conditional code to process a\ndifferent request syntax for HTTP/1.0 vs. HTTP/2.0. The two protocols will\nnot be forward/backward compatible if a syntax change is made to the\nrequest, causing a lot of headaches for everyone. I suggest avoiding the\nheadaches altogether and simply define the new request header field.\n\nCan someone point out a good reason NOT to accomodate the need for sending\na host name by putting it in a required header field as part of a complete\nURL?

Here's the first draft proposal for public review:\n\nThe digest authentication method can be used for authentification along the\nwhole chain and does not involve sending a password in the clear. It is\nintended to replace the Basic scheme ASAP. The next public release of the\ndaemon and CERN library will have it incorporated. The scheme is :-\n\nLet the password be P, the username be Uthe Realm be R and the hash function \nH(), let the binary operator a^b represent the concatenation of the strings a \nand b.\n\nThe Request:-\n\nRequest = Start ^ Boundary ^ Secure-Fields ^ Signature ^ \nInsecure-Fields ^ CRLF ^ Body\n\nWhere \nStart = Method  URI \"HTTP/1.0\" CRLF\nBoundary = \"Digest-Boundary: \"  Algorithm [, nonce] CRLF\n\nSecure-Fields = Any HTTP request fields\n\nSignature = Algorithm, S CRLF\nInsecure-Fields = Informational HTTP fields only (TBS)\n\n\nS = H(H(Boundary^Secure-Fields) ^ Date ^ H(P ^ U ^ \"@\" ^ R))\n\n\n\nAppols for the formatting, this has been changing a few times at Alans \nsuggestion and other peoples. The working spec is now on paper:-( and in\nC :-).\n\n\nThis scheme is not intended as a replacement for Shen, SHTTP or whatever, \nthe aims are:-\n\n1) Authentication only\n2) Unconstrained by export controls\n3) Unconstrained by patent restrictions\n4) Drop in one for one replacement of BASIC scheme\n5) Does not compromise high grade security schemes.\n6) Password never transmitted en-clair\n7) Access key not transmitted en-clair\n\n5) is most important. One area in which a lot of people are interested is in \nsetting up Web MUDs MOOs etc. Some people will run such systems to snarf \npasswords, despite warnings people will use the same password on multiple \nmachines. If we breach (7) once we can remove the need for the dungeon master to \never see the users plaintext password, the password is hashed in the client and \nthe hash value transmitted. This communication could be encrypted.\n\nThe main objection to the digest scheme is that the password file is all you \nneed for access. This is why the scheme does not replace the strong \nauthentication schemes in Shen or SHTTP (which should emerge as rsoon as we have \nthe two schemes combined.\n\n\nAs far as the proxy scheme goes it simplifies a few things, multiple \nencapsulations are possible for example, leaking authentication information is \nnot a security hole (it can only be used within the validity interval of the \nDate, there is also a stronger method of preventing a replay attack but it is \nnot practical on a forking UNIX server, it needs threads).\n\n\nPhill H-B\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16435475"}, {"subject": "A few semantic points for HTTP/1.0 draf", "content": "After a quick read through the HTTP/1.0 draft, I have a couple of comments.\nBy and large, the draft seems to be a very good representation of standard\npractice (with a nod to concerns over multi-part messages), but there are\ntwo \"pet peeves\" that remain unresolved and could be cleared up with a\nshort addition of some semantic info to the spec.\n\nSpecifically, there are minor ambiguities regarding the 503 error code\ndefined in section 6.3.4 and the encoding of object-body parts as described\nin section 7 and RFC 1630.\n\nRegarding section 6.3.4, the draft specifies that the error code \"503\nService Unavailable\" simply indicates that the server is unable to handle\nthe request. There are two different occasions when this code can be\nreturned, both of which are detailed in this paragraph. Unfortunately, one\nis a short-term, transient condition (busy) that the client may reasonably\nexpect to disappear momentarily. The other, a server is administratively\noff-line, is a condition of indeterminent duration and the client cannot\ninfer how long this condition will last.\n\nCurrent client support for 503 is minimal. As an example, NetScape's\nresponse to a 503 error is to begin repeatedly resending the client's\nrequest until it is satisfied or the client times out. If the server is\nmoderately busy, the client may be quickly serviced without impacting\nperformance from the user's or server's perspective. If the server is\nheavily overloaded, a rapid, repeated resubmission of the request will only\nmake the problem worse.\n\nIn the case that the server is administratively off line, and 503 is being\nreturned to indicate that the server is alive but unable to process\nconnections, client behavior as above is clearly unacceptable. Obviously,\nsome guidance in implementing client responses to this error code is\nneeded. Optimally, information should be returned to a client to help\ndetermine an appropriate client response to a 503 error.\n\nAs a solution, I'd like to propose an additional response-header for the\n503 error response that specifies a time at which the client may expect the\nserver to be able to handle requests again. This time should be relative to\nthe Date: header sent by the client. I propose that this time be specified\nas a delta from this date in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds until\navailability. The client should not attempt to resend its request before\nthis delta period of time has elapsed.\n\nFor the case of a busy server, this could be a delta of a few seconds from\nthe present (or a delta value calculated on the load of the server, depth\nof the request queue, etc.) For an \"off-line\" server, this could be a delta\nsupplied by administration (i.e. the server will be back up in 30 minutes)\nor an arbitrarily longer value (10 seconds, a few minutes) that would\nprevent rapid client retries.\n\nA candidate syntax for this response header field returned by the server is:\n\nRetry-After    = \"Retry-After\" \":\" *LWSP-char 3DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT\n\nThe 3 numeric fields represent the number of hours, minutes, and seconds to\nwait before attempting to contact the server again after the server has\nreported a 503 error. The server should also return its own Date: field as\npart of the response in all cases.\n\n\n\nWith regard to comment number 2, the encoding of object-body parts, there\nis a non-trivial ambiguity in RFC 1630 regarding the encoding of spaces as\n\"+\", and where this is allowed. For WWW clients that encode object-bodies\nusing the URL-encoding scheme, behavior is inconsistent. Some clients\nencode specials in the object-body text using %xx hex encodings\nexclusively. Others use %xx encodings for all specials except space, and\nencode spaces as \"+\".\n\nAccording to 1630, \"+\" may be used as a shorthand for space in the search\nportion of a URI. Unfortunately, the BNF for URIs is ambiguous in that the\ndefinition of the non-terminal \"xpalphas\" includes separating \"xalphas\"\nwith \"+\", implying that spaces can be encoded as \"+\" anywhere.\n\nIn my opinion, the object-body of a HTTP request is not the search portion\nof a URI. Therefore, spaces should only be encoded using %xx encodings and\nnot \"+\" encodings. This ambiguity has never been resolved and a definitive\nstatement regarding appropriate encoding of object-bodies using\nURL-encoding in this draft of the HTTP standard would be helpful. It may be\na moot point, since many clients encode POST arguments using both\ntechniques, and many gateway apps parse pluses as space. Nonetheless, an\nappropriate \"ruling\" should be made in the HTTP standard.\n\nThanks for your consideration,\nChuck Shotton\n\np.s.

Sending 503 should in the main be done only at the point\nwhere the server is about to collapse.\n\nOne solution to this is to use a threaded server and implement a lockout,\nonce a client recieves 503 the site is blacklisted for a period. Retry attempts\nin this interval would increase the blacklist period and/or return notification \nof a protocol violation.\n\nI like the idea of a retry in x seconds field, it would allow a server to \nschedule a slot where the request was guaranteed to be handled. I would like\nto have some control over the interpretation though. How about:-\n\nDeadtime: time[; reason=tag][; retry=policy]\n\nWhere time is the deadtime in seconds, a time of 0 being an indeterminate\nlength of time. \n\nreason tags could include:\n\nbusy \nmaintenance \n\nretry policies would include:\n\nblacklistretry attempts are now blacklisted\nignoreretry attempts are simply ignored\nlockoutretry attempts are dealt with by router lockout.\n\n\nThe final one is something added to one implementation to deal with denial\nof service attacks. If more than a certain number of accesses are made the\nsystem goes into `lockout mode'. This involves adding a filter record to the\nrouter to redirect packets to another server (amongst other things).\n\n\nWe should also have a facility to allow an alternative site to be stated.\nThis would permit rather more gracefull fallover and provide some load \nbalancing.\n\n\nPhill H-B\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16457552"}, {"subject": "Comments on HTTP draft [of 23 Nov 1994", "content": "I was very pleased to see the new HTTP draft; it's a major improvement\non previous versions!

Is this correct?  For example, in the example\n    in 7.1 there is a space after each comma (which certainly aids\n    readability).\n\n2.2 linear-white-space rule: I didn't understand the comment \"CRLF =>\n    Folding\".  I think this rule allows whitespace (but non-null) lines\n    in headers etc.?\n\n3.1 Header fields:\n\n    (a) \"However ... use of comments is discouraged\".  This seems rather\n    outside the scope of a definition such as this; at most it should be\n    a informational note, and explain why the note is there (historical\n    or client incompatibility, performance, reduced net traffic?).\n\n    (b) [nit] the second open quote in the comment rule should be a\n    close quote.\n\n    (c) The ctext rule seems to be missing some characters (there's an\n    open quote, followed by an open single quote, but neither is\n    closed).  Also, shouldn't LF be excluded too?\n\n3.2 Object body:\n\n    (a) This is my 'biggest' question -- I don't understand from the\n    second paragraph how to determine when to stop reading the data on a\n    request.  If the headers are only 'similar' to those defined by\n    MIME, then the MIME definition may or may not be relevant.\n    Moreover, a \"heuristic function of the Content-Type and\n    Content-Encoding\" would appear to be unimplementable, as new Types\n    (especially application/xxx) seem to spring up daily.\n\n    It would seem to be appropriate that the HTTP protocol specify that\n    Content-Length, in bytes, be Required--at least for Requests.\n\n    (b) Does the server have to read the headers (and data, if any) on a\n    request?  For example, if the customizing filter/script doesn't need\n    the information in order to determine the response, is the server\n    permitted to leave the data unread, or could this embarrass some\n    client(s) or TCP/IP stack(s)?\n\n4.1 Date/Time stamps:\n\n    (a) I'm a little disturbed that time is only permitted to be\n    specified to the second, given that most server hardware will be\n    able to handle many more than one request per second, and network\n    transit time is often sub-second.  If this is a limitation of RFC\n    1123, perhaps an additional HTTP header for sub-second time\n    information should be specified.\n\n    (b) Since this is a new standard/document, surely it should specify\n    a single Date/Time format, and only mention the others for\n    compatibility/historical information?\n\n    (c) [aside] I wish, oh wish, that Longitude/Latitude information\n    were a recommended header.\n\n4.2 Multipart types: From the text, I infer that a server/script is\n    not Required to respond with a multipart type when a client has\n    indicated that it can accept them.  It might be worth an explicit\n    statement to that effect.\n\n4.3.1 Date Header Field:\n\n    (a) [nit] should refer to RFC 1123 rather than 822, or both?\n\n    (b) It's not clear what time the header should refer to.  For a\n    response, is it the time when the request was accepted, or when the\n    response line was generated, or when the first line of the header\n    was transmitted, or when the 'Date:' header line was generated?\n\n    (c) [nit] 'of' is missing between 'creation date' and 'the\n    enclosed'.\n\n4.3.3 Message-ID: [suggestion] Although the example shows a unique ID,\n    it might be nice to encourage via the example a form of ID that\n    includes the port number (if not 80), and even follows URL format.\n    Perhaps:\n\n      Message-ID: <http://info.cern.ch:8080/9411251630.4256>\n\n4.3.4 MIME version: It is not at all clear why this is useful and\n    strongly recommended if it is not an indication of full compliance\n    with MIME.  One might argue that it should *not* be included unless\n    MIME-compliance of the remainder of the header and data is\n    guaranteed?\n\n5.  Request: The 0.9 requirement here (Simple Request must have Simple\n    Response) is somewhat onerous on a server.  Is it possible to relax\n    or remove this requirement yet, or are there still 0.9-only clients\n    in use?  I've noticed that at least some Simple Responses will not\n    go through some proxies transparently.\n\n5.2 Method and 5.2.2 Head: I'm surprised that the HEAD method *must* be\n    supported, as it is ill-defined.  5.2.2 simply says that there must\n    be no Object-Body; it seems that the header may or may not be\n    related to the header that would be sent if the method were GET, and\n    in particular, HEAD may as well just return an empty (null) header.\n\n    Further, in many cases the cost of determining, building and sending\n    the header is going to be the major part of many transactions, so\n    should clients or proxies be encouraged to use this Method?\n\n5.2.1 Get: [nit] The first paragraph should have the suffix: \"(unless\n    that is the produced data).\"\n\n5.2.3 Post:\n\n    (a) Some clarification seems to be needed here; there's an\n    assumption that Form data is used by some gateway program rather\n    than the server/script directly, but in the latter case the\n    specification (the paragraph starting \"If the URI does not refer to\n    a gateway...\") implies that the Form data must be retrievable at\n    some later date.\n\n    (b) Can the URI returned via a URI-header be a partial URI as\n    described in 5.4?  Or does it have to be a full URI?  [I infer the\n    latter.]\n\n5.2.3.1 [nit] Change 'references' to 'refers to'?\n\n5.3 HTTP Version: Given that this definition is more rigorous than\n    earlier documents, and hence must be more constraining, it would\n    seem to be necessary to change the version number (perhaps to 1.1)\n    to reflect the stricter conditions for compliance.  If the version\n    number is not changed, then the date of the relevant HTTP 1.0\n    document would have to be specified at every reference.\n\n5.4 URI Note 1: What's 'default escaping'?  What characters may be\n    'considered unsafe'?  The \"should\" (probably meant to be \"shall\"?)\n    implies that a server must comply with these conditions, but they do\n    not seem to be well defined.\n\n5.5.2 If-Modified-Since: This section implies that servers *must*\n    implement this feature.  However, the last-modified-date might be\n    unavailable, unreliable, or not applicable for some URIs.  In these\n    cases (or indeed in any case), is the server permitted to return the\n    object, despite the presence of the I-M-S header?\n\n5.5.4 Authorization: UU-encoding: if defined by RFC 1421, then this\n    should appear in Section 13 (References), and Appendix 15 should go\n    away (as it does not appear to apply, in any case)?\n\n6.3 Status Codes and Reason Phrases: The rule for Reason-Phrase does not\n    allow spaces, but several of the phrases specified later do include\n    a space.\n\n6.3.1 201 Created: Also possible following PUT, presumably.\n\n6.3.1 202 Accepted: \"delay header line\" is what?\n\n6.3.1 204 No Response: Allowed for POST, too?

All should say \"Server Error\"?\n\n6.3.4 503 Service Unavailable: Does this imply that a server is not\n    permitted to refuse to accept a connection?  [Presumably not, though\n    it could be read that way.]\n\n6.4 paragraph 1: [nit] change 'a Object-Body' to 'an ...'\n\n6.4.2 Version: since this refers to an object and not the server,\n    shouldn't it be in section 7?\n\n7.2 Content-Length Note 2: [nit] 'wherever' has only three 'e's.\n\n7.4 Content Encoding:\n\n    (a) [nit] this heading (and 7.5 too) needs a hyphen.\n\n    (b) [nit] change 'method' to 'mechanism' in the first paragraph to\n    avoid confusion with use of the term elsewhere?\n\n7.5 C-T-E: The rule omits the token and colon before the type.\n\n7.7 Expires: Are there any constraints on the Date and Time specified?\n    Specifically, may they refer to a time earlier than or the same as\n    that in the Date: header?\n\n7.9 URI First example: [nit] Change close quote to open quote.\n\n7.9 URI Second example: [nit] Semicolon missing.\n\n7.12 Title: \"isomorphic\" here implies that the Title follows SGML\n    syntax, and hence depends on the HTML DTD (including the\n    Declaration), and is allowed any valid entities and shortrefs\n    within, etc.  This probably isn't intended (I hope!).\n\n7.13 Link: [nit] both examples have unmatched quotes.

(0 and 1 are allowed values.)\n\n8 Neg. algorithm 'bs' definition: [nit] change 'send' to 'sent'\n\n9 Authentication, paragraph 1: Here is perhaps the strongest statement\n    in the document about conformance.  Yet, surely, if the server would\n    never return \"401 Unauthorized\" (because all its data are public)\n    there is no need for it to implement the Basic Access Authentication\n    Scheme?\n\n9 Authentication, fourth bullet: [nit] change second 'a' to 'an'.\n\n11.3 Abuse, para 1: While I strongly support the intent behind the last\n    sentence here, this document is a definition of the HTTP protocol,\n    not people using it.  It cannot impose requirements on, or define,\n    people.  (Does my server become non-conforming because someone using\n    my server abused his or her collected data?)  Also, am I (as the\n    writer, and hence provider, of a server) responsible for the actions\n    of other people *using* my server to provide data?  Thin ice...\n\n    Perhaps it should read something like: \"People using the HTTP\n    protocol to provide data are responsible for...\".\n\n11.3 Abuse, final para: This reads as though the user must be prompted\n    with the From field to be sent before sending every request.\n    Probably not the intent.\n\n16  Server Tolerance, para 2: Time to make this a Requirement?\n\n17  Bad servers: The first paragraph here sounds like a Compliance\n    statement.  As such, it should be in the body of the document, not an\n    appendix?   The document certainly needs a Compliance section.\n\n17.1 Back compatibility, para 2: This doesn't seem to reflect current\n    practice (inline <img href=\"xxx\"> requests for .GIF files do seem to\n    appear as images, not as HTML documents).\n\nmfc/29 Nov 1994\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16466214"}, {"subject": "Comments on the HTTP/1.0 draft", "content": "(By the way, I have not yet succeeded in getting myself subscribed to\nthis list, so please cc replies to me for the moment.)\n\nGenerally, I think the draft of Nov 28 is very good.\n\nRather egregiously missing is a reference to transmitting network\nobjects in canonical form.

The problem is that\nMosaic and its derivative works (including NetScape, derived from the\nprogrammers rather than the source) all encode spaces as + in object-body\nparts. The \"+\" token is very clearly intended to be a search term\nseparator, as specified in the URI RFC. Just because \"+\" is the\nrepresentation of spaces from the original Mosaic's data entry dialog for\nsearches is coincidence. As you say, Mosaic could have prompted repeatedly\nfor single search terms, concatenating them with \"+\".\n\nHowever, we are talking about slightly different subjects. I am\nspecifically requesting a clarification on what it means to have\nobject-body content that uses \"URL-Encoding\", and whether or not the usage\nof \"+\" as an encoding for spaces is acceptable in an object-body part. I\nhave always felt that it is incorrect to use \"+\" for ANYTHING but keyword\nseparators in the search term portion of a URL. \"+\" in an object-body that\nis URL-encoded should be represented as %2B and spaces as %20. This would\navoid any confusion with CGIs that interpret + as space, though it would do\nlittle to keep clients from emitting them in the first place.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this is a minor issue. But clarifying it can\nmake life a little easier for CGI authors and client implementors.\n\n--_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\\_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\nChuck Shotton                             \\\nAssistant Director, Academic Computing     \\   \"Shut up and eat your\nU. of Texas Health Science Center Houston   \\    vegetables!!!\"\ncshotton@oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu  (713) 794-5650 \\\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\\-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16498304"}, {"subject": "Re: Comments on the HTTP/1.0 draft", "content": "1) + is not part of any \"URL-encoding\".\n2) I think this is a HTML and not a HTTP issue\n\nIETF has 3 working groups working on different but related standards:\nURI (URL, URN, etc.), HTML, and (presumably, after the BOF and the\napproval of the charter), HTTP.

In fact, Henrik had proposed the same while we were in the process\nof writing it, but it didn't find its way into the spec.  The problem was\nwas that neither of us were sure of what the format should be, and I see\nfrom the ensuing discussion on this list that others are having that problem\nas well.\n\nThe way I see it, there are three viable options:\n\n   Retry-After    = \"Retry-After\" \":\" delta-seconds\nor \n   Retry-After    = \"Retry-After\" \":\" HTTP-date\nor\n   Retry-After    = \"Retry-After\" \":\" delta-seconds / HTTP-date\nwhere\n   delta-seconds  = 1*DIGIT\n\nThere is no point in dealing with milliseconds -- that level of accuracy\nis just not necessary.

I would not make this\na delta, since large time deltas are hard for people to grok.\nPerhaps the third alternative is best then, since it is trivial for\nthe receiver to differentiate between an HTTP-date and a delta-seconds.\n\nComments?\n\n\n> With regard to comment number 2, the encoding of object-body parts, there\n> is a non-trivial ambiguity in RFC 1630 regarding the encoding of spaces as\n> \"+\", and where this is allowed.

Since the IETF URL spec does not itself give a full\nspecification of HTTP URLs, it will probably have to be included here\nso that the URL RFC can eventually include a proper reference.\nOne problem then is how to handle the conflict between WWW URI's and\nIETF URLs.\n\nOn the other hand, somebody (perhaps the HTML-WG) may wish to define\nthe application/www-url-encoded-form as a real media type for use in other\nprotocols, in which case it should not be in the HTTP spec.\nDoes anyone think that is likely?

Is this correct?  For example, in the example\n>     in 7.1 there is a space after each comma (which certainly aids\n>     readability).\n\nOne major problem with the augmented BNF used by RFC822 (and MIME)\nis that it allows any amount of linear white space between tokens,\nbut never specifies that in the rule definitions (it is treated as\na general assumption for all rules).  I can understand why -- it is\nmuch easier to read the rules without the extra clutter -- but it runs\nagainst my desire for formality.\n\nWhat do people think?  Define a new rule, e.g.\n\n    ESP = 1*( [CRLF] LWSP-char )\n\nand insert it everywhere that zero or more linear-white-space is allowed?\nOr, just stick with the current method but add an explanation in 2.1.\n\n> 2.2 linear-white-space rule: I didn't understand the comment \"CRLF =>\n>     Folding\".  I think this rule allows whitespace (but non-null) lines\n>     in headers etc.?\n\nThe comments will be clarified.\n\n> 3.1 Header fields:\n> \n>     (a) \"However ... use of comments is discouraged\".

I really should replace\nall the smart-quotes in the BNF with normal double-quotes.\n\n>     (c) The ctext rule seems to be missing some characters (there's an\n>     open quote, followed by an open single quote, but neither is\n>     closed).

If not, then LF needs to be excluded.\n\n> 3.2 Object body:\n> \n>     (a) This is my 'biggest' question -- I don't understand from the\n>     second paragraph how to determine when to stop reading the data on a\n>     request.  If the headers are only 'similar' to those defined by\n>     MIME, then the MIME definition may or may not be relevant.\n>     Moreover, a \"heuristic function of the Content-Type and\n>     Content-Encoding\" would appear to be unimplementable, as new Types\n>     (especially application/xxx) seem to spring up daily.\n\nHenrik asked me to explain that as well, but I ran out of time.\nIt goes something like this:\n\n   a) If message includes Content-Length, use it.\n\n   b) If message uses an as-yet-undefined packetized Content-Transfer-Encoding,\n      then that encoding may define an EOF marker.\n\n   c) If message uses an as-yet-undefined packetized Content-Encoding,\n      then that encoding may define an EOF marker.\n\n   d) If message is of type multipart/*, the effective object body ends\n      when the boundary close-delimiter is reached.\n\n   e) If the connection closes, the object body has ended.\n\nPart (b) is along the lines of Dan Connolly's www-talk proposal of 27 Sep 1994\n(Message-Id: <9409271503.AA27488@austin2.hal.com>).\n\nQuestion for HTTP/1.1: Should we attempt to extend MIME C-T-E to be something\nuseful, or just change Content-Encoding to be an ordered list of encodings\nrather than the current single-token?\n\n>     It would seem to be appropriate that the HTTP protocol specify that\n>     Content-Length, in bytes, be Required--at least for Requests.\n\nI'd rather not go that far, but we may have to for HTTP/1.0.\n\n>     (b) Does the server have to read the headers (and data, if any) on a\n>     request?  For example, if the customizing filter/script doesn't need\n>     the information in order to determine the response, is the server\n>     permitted to leave the data unread, or could this embarrass some\n>     client(s) or TCP/IP stack(s)?\n\nThe Request-Headers must be read, though implementations may want to optimize\nand assume that if the Request-Headers have not completed within the first\nread buffer, then the rest are not important.  Since that is only a problem\nfor SOME BROKEN CLIENTS, most servers could successfully pretend to be\nconformant while implementing the optimization.  Obviously, if there is\nany data in the request, the server had better read it (unless the request\nline has already errored-out).\n\nLeaving request data unread will not be a problem for the client, though\nit may cause a problem for the server.  Simon could explain that better\nthan I.\n\n> 4.1 Date/Time stamps:\n> \n>     (a) I'm a little disturbed that time is only permitted to be\n>     specified to the second, given that most server hardware will be\n>     able to handle many more than one request per second, and network\n>     transit time is often sub-second.  If this is a limitation of RFC\n>     1123, perhaps an additional HTTP header for sub-second time\n>     information should be specified.\n\nNot a limitation of 1123, but a limitation of many operating system\ndate routines.  Besides, there is no useful purpose for that level\nof granularity in an application-level protocol.\n\n>     (b) Since this is a new standard/document, surely it should specify\n>     a single Date/Time format, and only mention the others for\n>     compatibility/historical information?\n\nThe document has a bit of history associated with it, but perhaps a stronger\nstatement should be made.  I didn't want to be too forceful, however, since\nI am biased about the date format and wanted to test the water first.\n\n>     (c) [aside] I wish, oh wish, that Longitude/Latitude information\n>     were a recommended header.\n\n[aside] it's too inefficient to include that in every response.  A standard\nURL for site info is more appropriate.\n\n> 4.2 Multipart types: From the text, I infer that a server/script is\n>     not Required to respond with a multipart type when a client has\n>     indicated that it can accept them.  It might be worth an explicit\n>     statement to that effect.\n\nHmmm, I guess that sentence (4.2.1) could be misinterpreted.  I'll clarify it.\n\n> 4.3.1 Date Header Field:\n> \n>     (a) [nit] should refer to RFC 1123 rather than 822, or both?\n\nNo, the semantics are defined in RFC 822 -- RFC 1123 just updates the format\n(and other things unrelated to origin-date).\n\n>     (b) It's not clear what time the header should refer to.  For a\n>     response, is it the time when the request was accepted, or when the\n>     response line was generated, or when the first line of the header\n>     was transmitted, or when the 'Date:' header line was generated?\n\nThat is implementation-specific and, in any case, is assumed to be\nall within the same second (+/- 1).  In theory, it is the moment just before\nthe status/request-line is generated (i.e. it is the time at which the \norigin made the determination of what the request/response should be).\nIn practice, it makes no difference.\n\n>     (c) [nit] 'of' is missing between 'creation date' and 'the\n>     enclosed'.\n\nAFID (Already fixed in the I-D)\n\n> 4.3.3 Message-ID: [suggestion] Although the example shows a unique ID,\n>     it might be nice to encourage via the example a form of ID that\n>     includes the port number (if not 80), and even follows URL format.\n>     Perhaps:\n> \n>       Message-ID: <http://info.cern.ch:8080/9411251630.4256>\n\nThe above is not a valid syntax for Message-IDs (no \"@\").  Even with it,\nthe primary purpose of the Message-ID is to enable messages (particularly\nPOSTs) via gateways.  Using the same format as many (most?) E-mail and\nUSENET postal services can be very handy.\n\n> 4.3.4 MIME version: It is not at all clear why this is useful and\n>     strongly recommended if it is not an indication of full compliance\n>     with MIME.  One might argue that it should *not* be included unless\n>     MIME-compliance of the remainder of the header and data is\n>     guaranteed?\n\nI share that opinion, but then we run into legacy issues.\n\n> 5.  Request: The 0.9 requirement here (Simple Request must have Simple\n>     Response) is somewhat onerous on a server.  Is it possible to relax\n>     or remove this requirement yet, or are there still 0.9-only clients\n>     in use?  I've noticed that at least some Simple Responses will not\n>     go through some proxies transparently.\n\nI believe proxies require Full-Requests.  Ari?\nI do not believe it is possible to remove that requirement, though perhaps\nwe should require that HTTP/1.0 clients never generate a Simple-Request.\n\n> 5.2 Method and 5.2.2 Head: I'm surprised that the HEAD method *must* be\n>     supported, as it is ill-defined.  5.2.2 simply says that there must\n>     be no Object-Body; it seems that the header may or may not be\n>     related to the header that would be sent if the method were GET, and\n>     in particular, HEAD may as well just return an empty (null) header.\n\nThe definition of all the request methods need fleshing-out, but support\nfor HEAD will still be required.\n\n>     Further, in many cases the cost of determining, building and sending\n>     the header is going to be the major part of many transactions, so\n>     should clients or proxies be encouraged to use this Method?\n\nThat only reflects the cost for the server.  The cost to the rest of the\nnetwork is significantly less, and that is what is important here.\n\n> 5.2.1 Get: [nit] The first paragraph should have the suffix: \"(unless\n>     that is the produced data).\"\n\nHmmmmmmmmmmm.......I'll think of some other way to clarify it.\n\n> 5.2.3 Post:\n> \n>     (a) Some clarification seems to be needed here; there's an\n>     assumption that Form data is used by some gateway program rather\n>     than the server/script directly, but in the latter case the\n>     specification (the paragraph starting \"If the URI does not refer to\n>     a gateway...\") implies that the Form data must be retrievable at\n>     some later date.\n\nI think the confusion lies in the term \"gateway\", which in this case is\nreferring to a mail or USENET gateway, rather than a CGI script. \n\n>     (b) Can the URI returned via a URI-header be a partial URI as\n>     described in 5.4?  Or does it have to be a full URI?  [I infer the\n>     latter.]\n\nMany people have requested the former, but I have yet to see an\nimplemented example of it.  Now that I have separated the URI-header\ndefinition from Location, we could define it as being allowed for\nURI but not for Location.\n\n> 5.2.3.1 [nit] Change 'references' to 'refers to'?\n\nokay\n\n> 5.3 HTTP Version: Given that this definition is more rigorous than\n>     earlier documents, and hence must be more constraining, it would\n>     seem to be necessary to change the version number (perhaps to 1.1)\n>     to reflect the stricter conditions for compliance.  If the version\n>     number is not changed, then the date of the relevant HTTP 1.0\n>     document would have to be specified at every reference.\n\nThat is a philosophical issue that will be discussed in San Jose.\nIf necessary, a subset of this spec will be assigned \"HTTP/1.0\" and\nwork will continue on HTTP/1.1.  That decision will have to be made\neventually, but not right away.\n\n> 5.4 URI Note 1: What's 'default escaping'?  What characters may be\n>     'considered unsafe'?

However, I agree\nthat what is now appendix A should be rewritten to specify the uuencoding\nof a string, not a file.\n\n> 6.3 Status Codes and Reason Phrases: The rule for Reason-Phrase does not\n>     allow spaces, but several of the phrases specified later do include\n>     a space.\n\nHmmmm, I could have sworn that I has changed \"1*token\" to \"phrase\".\nIn any case, the augmented BNF allows spaces between any tokens.\n\n> 6.3.1 201 Created: Also possible following PUT, presumably.\n\nAFID\n\n> 6.3.1 202 Accepted: \"delay header line\" is what?\n\nAFID\n\n> 6.3.1 204 No Response: Allowed for POST, too?

In\nparticular, some CGIs that generate their own HTTP response headers may\nhave trouble determining the length of their generated replies, especially\nif the replies are generated on the fly and returned piece by piece (to\nstdout, for example.) By the time the content-length is known, the header\nportion of the response is long gone.\n\nFor responses from the server, it seems to be sufficient for the connection\nclose to indicate the end of the object-body, and everyone seems to support\nthis now. The real problem is with object-bodies being sent as part of a\nclient request, since it is inappropriate to signal the end by closing the\nconnection. In THIS case, it may be appropriate to make the content-length\nheader field mandatory.\n\nSo, the mandate for content-length may not be symmetrical, since servers\nhave a much harder time determining this value than clients. (Of course,\nnew clients with plug-in components a la CGI could present the same\nproblems that currently afflict servers with regard to calculating\ncontent-length.)\n\n>>     (b) Does the server have to read the headers (and data, if any) on a\n>>     request?

It is difficult to determine when\nrequest-headers end if you don't assume that the first read buffer contains\nthe \"meat\" of the request.

Why is\ncanonical encoding unnecessary?  Do you really mean that any server,\non any architecture, can (for example) transmit text files using\nwhatever its local system convention for line breaks might happen to\nbe (CR, LF, CRLF, whatever) without standardizing it?  How can we be\npassing local forms around between different machines and expect it to\nwork reliably?\n\nYes, I know that pretty much all existing servers run under UNIX and\njust blindly send the UNIX line break without making any effort to\nnormalize it, but the spec should document correct behavior, with\nexisting behavior mentioned, as it currently is, in the appendix.  The\ncurrent document is a little strange, in that the appendix recommends\nassuming any newline is a line break to tolerate bad servers/clients,\nbut nowhere in the document does it seem to say what the *correct*\nbehavior is, or why those programs are bad.  I believe strongly that\nthe correct behavior is to send things only in canonical form.\n\nActually, after thinking about this a little more, I realized the MIME\nencoding model isn't adequate, because HTTP adds a new layer of\nencoding (\"Content-Encoding: x-gzip\" or the like) and the spec needs\nto explicitly state when that encoding gets done and undone relative\nto canonicalization (if we include that) and CTE.  I think the model\nshould specify that content-encoding happens after canonicalization\nbut before the CTE, if any (there should be none, of course, normally)\nis applied.\n\n(Actually, I wouldn't object to outright prohibiting any CTE other\nthan clear ones like 7bit, 8bit and binary, but maybe there are\nreasons to allow q-p and base64.)\n\n>> As near as I can tell, the spec constrains all header values to be\n>> US-ASCII, meaning nothing that is not US-ASCII may be contained in\n>> them.

Plenty of\npeople who have names with non-ASCII characters in them like to\ninclude those names in a From: header, for example.  It's not\nnecessarily urgent, but I think it will get used anyway in areas like\nFrom: that are only used for logging and shouldn't break anything.\nIt's not as though it would be legal in URLs or Content-Types or\nanything heavily interpreted, and I don't think it would break any\nexisting software.\n\nI don't see how having them only be encoded by gateways will suffice.\nHow would one represent non-US-ASCII information in a header?\nSpecifically, how would one indicate what character set is being\nemployed, if not by using MIME part 2?

It has taken over a year for the general community of\nclients and servers to become tolerant of all the line end variations. An\nexplicit statement in the standard about tolerant EOL representations would\nbe good.\n\nIMHO, it should state that CR, LF, and CRLF should all be interpreted\nequally as EOL when used as line ends. This avoids any problems with\nmachine dependent EOL symbols, and fairly represents the current practice.\n(It also avoids forcing clients and especially servers to do line-by-line\ntranslations of EOL for all outgoing response information, which is a BIG\nperformance hit.)\n\n>Yes, I know that pretty much all existing servers run under UNIX...\n\nThis is a fallacy and should not in any way, shape, or form be allowed to\ncolor the HTTP standard.

Or should we expect\n  all clients to be clever enough to recognize that and discard it? :-)\n\n  OK, end of tirade (maybe.)  If people simply must ship around\n  objects with different ways of representing the same thing, there\n  should be an out-of-bandwidth way to indicate that.  A\n  Content-Encoding of \"unix-text\", for instance, could indicate that\n  line breaks are represented with LF.  Obviously a provision for\n  multiple C-Es would be needed to describe things like \"gzipped UNIX\n  text\".  This should be a C-E, though, not a C-T-E.  A proposed C-T-E\n  for UNIX text would probably trigger an uproar of laughter on the\n  MIME mailing list (and rightly so.)\n\n- Passing thought:  If a request contains a Message-ID header, should\n  the server include that message-ID in the response, maybe in an\n  In-Reply-To: header?\n\n\n   - Marc\n--\nMarc VanHeyningen  <URL:http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/mvanheyn.html>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-16776686"}, {"subject": "PC???????? ?????? ??????(??????)? ?????????? ?????? ??????(??????)?[??????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1699225"}, {"subject": "[????????] ??????

To take an extreme\nexample:\n\nMIME allows the Content-Type Multipart/alternative to\ncontain body parts which themselves are Multipart/\nalternative, and it is thus possible to recursively include\nMultipart/alternative inside Multipart/ alternative to\narbitrary depth.\n\nSuppose then that testing of existing e-mail software\ndemonstrates, that there are no two independent\nimplementations, which are able to interoperate in handling\nof Multipart/alternative nested to a higher level than,\nsay, 17. Must then the MIME standard, in order to become a\ndraft standard, say that Multipart/alternative-nesting must\nbe limited to 17, since this is the only functionality\nwhich two independent implementations can inter- operate\nwith?\n\nIn this extreme example, I am sure that everyone would say\nthat such an arbitrary nesting level should not have to be\nput into a standard. But there are other less obvious\ncases. As regards MHTML, the following are examples:\n\nIf no two interworking implemantions allow use of MHTML to\nsend a set of several linked web pages in one e-mail,\nshould then MHTML, if moved to draft, have to specify that\nthis is not allowed?\n\nIf no two interworking imlementations allow sending of HTML\nmessages which include a style sheet in a separate file,\nmust then the standard specify that this is not allowed?\n\nThe MHTML-standard says that its methodology might also be\nused when sending XML or VRML, not only HTML. Must this be\nremoved if no such interoperable implementations are found?\n\nThe MHTML-standard contains clauses on how illegal URLs\n(for example URLs containing the space character) can be\nsent. Must this be removed if there are no existing\nimplementations that actually can send messages with URLs\ncontaing spaces?\n-- \nJacob Palme <jpalme@dsv.su.se> (Stockholm University and KTH)\nfor more info see URL: http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1952042"}, {"subject": "[????????] ???? ?????? ???????? ??????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-1961295"}, {"subject": "PLEASE RESPOND URG", "content": "FROM THE DESK OF\nDR.YINKA.

ADAMS, Chief Accountant in the Ministry of petroleum Resources (MPR) and a member of a \nseven-man Tender Board in charge of contract review and payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but exercise patience and read on.\n\nThere were series of contracts executed by a consortium Multinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of Petroleum Resources among which were:\n\n1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million.\n\n2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country~ US$ 152 Million.\n\n3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 Million.\n\nThe original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies\nthat actually executed these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant and are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant Laws) from opening operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses (Internal & External) between the parties in the\ncourse of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up an investment plan for us of which you will control since we cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in real\nestate in your country. You must however note that this transaction is subjected to the following terms and conditions:\n\n1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence.\n\n2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality because of the circumstances we now find ourselves.\n\n3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have absolute control. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the presidency at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the\nimmediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To accord this transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the parties involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of your company you may nominate\nas the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to invest these funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be of immense help in this regards.\n\nKindly expedite action so as to enable us include this transaction into this batch as payment to foreign contractors is usually carried out on quarterly basis.\nPlease, contact me as soon as possible on my private \ne-mail address:duru11@hotvoice.com\nBest regards,\n\nDR.YINKA.A.

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal after reali\n zing that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.

They talk over and over again about (a) transition from IPv4 to \nIPv6 (b) addressing mechanisms in IPv6.\n\nIt is time Applications Area give some major input into that discussion.\n\nSeveral of you are working very hard within these working groups, and I \nthank you for your hard work. I do though think we need some \ncoordinated action.\n\n From my point of view, address translation in the IP layer is a VERY \nBAD THING from an application perspective. It means two end nodes can \nnot open direct connection to each other. This is something very \ndifferent from firewalls which are there to block some traffic due to \nsome policy someone want to apply on the path.\n\nBut, if the policy on a path is such that certain traffic is ok, then \nthat traffic should be able to pass through using globally unique IP \naddresses.\n\nYes, in IPv4 land we have NAT all over the place. When doing IPv4 and \nIPv6, we will have NAT-like things all over the place.\n\nMy number one argument for moving to IPv6 is that we have enough \naddresses to have unique addresses on every device, so NAT will not be \nneeded in v6 only land.\n\nIn the addressing architecture there is something called \"Site Local\", \nwhich one can claim (in a naive way) that they are like RFC 1918 \naddresses. \"Not to be used on the global Internet\". The arguments for \nusing those is that sometime one is not connected to the global \nInternet. My problem is that that was the fact with RFC 1918 addresses \nas well, but see what we have today! People connect these networks, but \napply a NAT box between the RFC 1918 network and the Internet.\n\nWhat I want to see is that the wording and design of the Site Local \naddressing should be such that NAT boxes is a bad thing. Even better, I \nwant an addressing scheme which makes \"RFC-1918-like\" addresses \nnon-existing in IPv6.\n\n\nNow, yes, I am one of the two Area Directors for Applications Area. And \nI have this very strong view.\n\nI now hand over the work to you. I need to know if I have a different \nview than \"applications area\".\n\nWhat I want to have is a common view of the Applications people in the \nIETF on these \"RFC 1918-like\" addressing schemes.\n\nAre they ok?\nWhen and why?\nWhat can they be used for?\nWhat is they not good for?\n\nI would like to have an I-D talking about these issues, from an \napplication layer perspective.\n\nAny takers on being the editor on a document like this?\n\n      Patrik\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-2308713"}, {"subject": "I NEED YOUR URGENT ASSITANC", "content": "  \nFROM: MARIAM ABACHA\nKANO- NIGERIA\nE-mail:\n\nDEAR SIR, \nHOW ARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY?

SIR, IT  MAY INTEREST YOU TO NOTE THAT RECENTLY A SIMILAR TRANSACTION WAS CARRIED OUT  WITH ONE MR.SIGNORE PAOLO LUIGI, A DIRECTOR OF MILANOCONSTRUCTION S.P.A ITALY.\n\n AFTER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN US IN WHICH HE WAS TO TAKE 20% OF THE USD$25  MILLION IN ONE OF THE BOXES IN THE SECURITY COMPANY,THE DOCUMENTS WERE SIGNED  BY HIM AND ONE OF THE BOX WAS RELEASED TO HIM AS THE ORIGINAL BENEFICIARY WHICH  HETOOK TO ITALY. WE WERE DISAPPOINTED ON THE ARRIVAL OF MY ATTORNEY BARRISTER  VICTOR BOATING(SAN)WITH email:(victoruba2000@yahoo.com) ARRIVED INITALY TO\n DISCOVER THAT MR.SIGNORE PAOLO LUIGI WAS NO WHERETOBE FOUND. \n\nTHIS WAS HOW WE LOST USD$25 MILLION FROM THE USD$100 MILLION AND WE ARE NOW LEFT  WITH USD$75 MILLION IN THE SECURITY COMPANY IN EUROPE WHICH YOU WILL HELP- US  TO KEEP IN YOUR CUSTODY.I,AND MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY HAVE AGREED TO LET YOU HAVE  PART OF THE TOTAL FUNDS FOR WHATEVER ASSISTANCE YOU HAVE DECIDED TO RENDER.PLEASE BE PREPARED TO CLEAR THIS BOXES AS WE ARE GOING TO PRESENT YOU AS  THE BENEFICIARY OF THIS BOXES WITH THE DOCUMENTS IN YOURHANDS.\n\nPLEASE CONTACT ME THROUGH THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS TO DISCUSS THE MODALITY OF  THISTRANSACTION.HOWEVER,PLEASE TREAT THIS AS A TOP SECRET AND BE PREPARED TO DO  MORE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS WITH US. SIR I AM GIVING YOU 100% ASSURANCE THAT THERE  IS NO RISK INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSACTION.SIR,YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE NOW THAT I KNOW WILL HELP MEAND MY FAMILY. \n\nI AM AWAITING YOUR URGENT AND FAVOURABLE RESPONSE.\nBEST REGARDS,\n\nMARIAM ABACHA \nPLEASE TREAT WITH URGENCY AND CONFIDENTIALITY THIS DESERVES.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-2319023"}, {"subject": "???? ?????? ?? ?? ????????~!

One of the reasons the \nInternet was able to take off the way it did was that individuals and small \ngroups could dream up new applications and deploy them easily.  By \nhindering that, NATs threaten to cause stagnation of Internet development, \nand loss of all the potential ensuing business activity.

Furthermore, many\ncompanies use black-hole routing to control external access; i.e., they're\nusing double-NAT on the gateways to completely isolate the networks'\naddressing, and force use of an intermediary in the DMZ for all traffic\nfrom the inside to out.\n\nWhen such extreme policies are in place, NAT makes sense to administrators\nas one tool; implementation is simple, meaning there's less chance of an\nexploit against the device itself (as compared to a firewall). Of course,\nit must be used in conjunction with a firewall, but having multiple layers\nof policy applied increases security in their eyes.\n\nThe configuration outlined above was that used at my former employer, a\nfinancial services company with over four trillion USD under management\n(much less now ;).\n\nThe opportunity cost of limiting new applications was dwarfed by the risk\nof having externally-addressable hosts, so they used NAT. If you can\nrefute this argument for security, it would be good to include it in such\na paper, but IMO it won't convince them no matter how well-reasoned.\n\nI think time arguing against NAT would be better spent talking about why\nit shouldn't be deployed for general-purpose access (e.g., in home\nrouters, wireless bridges, at ISPs, conferences, hotel rooms, etc.). In\nparticular, it should address the issue of why using number of IP\naddresses used as a charging model for access is a bad idea.\n\nCheers,\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-2620241"}, {"subject": "CONFIDENTIA", "content": "FROM: DR.

So it's obviously possible.   \nWhether it's feasible to deploy apps that need this kind of \ninfrastructure is a different question.\n\nFor a specific example, try designing a DNS-like system that works\nover NATs and allows its clients and servers  to reside anywhere \nin the network (e.g. it doesn't constrain the servers to reside in\na global network outside NATs).   You'll find that you need proxies\nto sit on the outside of those NATs to allow them to access servers\ninside the NATs.

Yes, I'm tripping over an \nend-to-end assumption made in the protocol, but I don't get the \n'myth' part.\n\nYou describe the problem nearly dead on.  When using the existing \ncache mechanisms in DNS, they can become an obstacle if an old \nversion is not compatible with a new feature.  With end-to-end being \na possibility, I could 'route around' the cache - this is possible in \nthe protocol.  But when end-to-end is not possible, as in the case of \na NAT bottlenecking all traffic, then I can't route around the old \ncache.\n\nDesigning DNS to be tolerant of NATs is a pain, as Keith alludes to \nin a previous message.  It's remotely possible, but a real waste of \ntime and energy.  Just as other applications want to mimic DNS's \nrecursive lookup behavior (which is a mistake), DNS shouldn't turn \naround and mimic store and forward behavior of its messages.

MENA OVIE-WHISKEY\nFEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS & HOUSING. \nFEDERAL SECRETARIAT,FALOMO- LAGOS, NIGERIA. \n\nDear Sir, \n\nBUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$25.4 MILLION (TWENTY-FIVE MILLION, FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). \n\nFirst, I must solicit your trust and strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as been utterly confidential and top secret. You were recommended to me by a director at the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce (Foreign Trade Division). He does not know what I am about to introduce to you. I simply told him that I wanted foreign partners for investment purposes. \n\nI am the Director of Engineering & Project of the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing in  Nigeria. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$25,400,000.00 into your private or company account for mutual benefits. This money came about as a result of a contract for the construction of several road projects, Porthacourt-Elemen Pipeline project and  Y2K compliance turn-around maintenance executed on behalf of my Ministry(F.M.W&H), in the year 1999. This contract was officially assigned to be awarded and executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of US$105,400,000.00, but in the course of my negotiation, I bargained with only one foreign contractor, a Bulgarian firm which now executed the contract at the cost ofUS$80,00.000.00. Thus leaving the remaining US$25.4M floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria(C.B.N) to the benefits of we the three members of the contract award panel unknown to the contractor and any other person in my Min!\nistry. This contract has been satisfactorily executed, inspected and commissioned, and the Bulgarian firm is presently securing his payment from my Ministry. \n\nIt is however to this effect that I seek your maximum assistance and approval to present your company name alongside with the Bulgarian contractor as the second foreign contractor to enable me transfer the difference (US$25.4M) into your account for further investment depending on your advice. \n\nOn actualization of the transaction, the funds will be shared thus: \n1. 20% of the money go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds. \n2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction for insurance, phone bills, documentation etc. \n3. 70% to us the three members of the Contract Award Panel. \n\nAll logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth actualization of the transaction within fourteen working days of commencement after receipt of the following information by fax: Your company's Name. Address. Phone/Fax number and activities. Also, if we opt for electronic transfer only other than payment by solar bank draft or cash call program, then your bank account particulars. \n\nThe above information will enable me make the application and lodge claims to the concerned Ministries in favor of your company or name and it is pertinent to state here that this deal is entirely based on trust and the fear of God. \n\nIf you are able to handle, feel free to reach me on my via this email box or : Thereafter, I will furnish you with my confidential line as that will enable you reach my office directly. Also furnish me with your own phone and fax numbers as I will be sending you all necessary registration documents immediately I receive your positive response. \n\nThanks in anticipation for your positive response. \n\nYours faithfully. \n\nDr. Mena Ovie-Whiskey\n \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3312000"}, {"subject": "&lt;????&gt;?????? 5?????? ????????...(???? ????%", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3321589"}, {"subject": "MISS FLEISS ESCORT SITE FOR SAL", "content": "Due to ill health I have to sell my Adult Escort site\nhttp://www.missfleiss.com\n\nI am making $150,000 pa\n\nI need to sell it urgently for $15,000\n\nplease email me at suzannewood@bigpond.com\n\nor call Miss Fleiss in Sydney Australia 02 93103011  and quote my reference no\nhgt435434\n\nThis is an urgent sale \n3859vxme1-292jNwx4009lfTf8-757AGRi6297fpeu1-561tEPx0678dleX9-903oBlx8342Rl69\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3328301"}, {"subject": "Consistently Lose Pounds &amp; Inches!

Clearly, the new viewpoint can \nbe made to work (at a price in added overall \"host\" complexity), but as \nexperience shows not every application designer is thinking in terms \nnecessary for new applications to work in this environment.  In time, given \nthat NAT is a reality, maybe application designers will be weaned off their \ndependency on IP address stability for creating rendezvous points -- but I \nthink the alternatives will all be more complex, and for what other advantage?\n\nAlso I think the \"plug-and-play\" advantage you cite, like security, is \nsomething that can be provided separately from the existence of NAT.\n\n>Graham> Where this all leads, I think, is that the worst thing about NAT \n>is that it\n>Graham> hinders the deployment of new applications.\n>\n>How is this different from having \"protected\" ports below 1000 on\n>Unix?\n\nI think that's entirely different -- I'm not sure why you suggest it's \nnot.  The protected ports don't prevent the deployment of new applications \nbecause application designers *can* choose non-protected ports.\n\n#g\n\n\n-------------------\nGraham Klyne\n<GK@NineByNine.org>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3446027"}, {"subject": "(????)?????? ?????? ???????? ???? ????????~?????????? ?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3457060"}, {"subject": "PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE", "content": "Good Day,\n\nWith warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you as a person of integrity.\n\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this proposal. \n\nMy Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek p!\nolitical asylum.\n\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. \n\nPresident Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.\n\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\n\nYour role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \n\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \n\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.\n\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \n\nPlease contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.\n\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the link below and read. \n\nhttp://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html\n\nSincerely,\nO.C.Savimbi.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3464015"}, {"subject": "?????? ???? ?????????? ??????????.. ?????? ??????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3474655"}, {"subject": "?????? ????!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3481148"}, {"subject": "{?? ??} ?????? ?????????? ???", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3487329"}, {"subject": "[????????]????????????????????^^-???? ?????????? ??????????????100%???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3493790"}, {"subject": "LED application", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3500850"}, {"subject": "[????] ???? ????! ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ????????!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3507826"}, {"subject": "?K?Q???L?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-3514722"}, {"subject": "Bunga Email  L'idee cadeau pour Noel (PUB", "content": "  <Desinscription en bas de page>\n  (PUB) www.bunga.fr vous pr?sente plus de 70 id?es cadeaux pour les f?tes! \n           \n   \n    \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n       \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Simplifiez-vous la vie et profitez des prix exceptionnels du fleuriste Web en bois exotique www.bunga.fr, plus de 70 id&eacute;es cadeaux pour les prochaines f&ecirc;tes.

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered\ntime (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at\nUS$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon\nmaturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got\nno reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\nhis contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.\nBarry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I\nfound out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next\nof kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and\ndiscovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of\nUS$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will\ncome forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration\nof 6{Six} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian\nGovernment if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal\nis that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to\nMr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get\ninto the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple;\n1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and\naddress so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and\naffidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.\n2) We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and\nnotarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\n3) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then\nfacilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of\nkin of Mr.Barry Kelly. The money will be paid into your account for us to\nshare in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you then 5% will be set aside for any expenses that may occure during the transfer process.\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be\ndone by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the\nsuccessful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please\nreply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response,\nI shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that\nwill help you understand.

However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this \ntransaction, which I propose to you as a person of transparency,honesty \nand caliber.\n \nLet me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name \nis Robertson Savimbi cousin and Personal Assistant of Jonas Malheiro \nSavimbi, the leader UNITA (National Union for the Total independence \nof Angola). I got your email address from network directory. I \napologize if I have infringed  on your privacy.\n\nYou may know that my Uncle was  killed in a battle with \nthe government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on friday \n22nd February, 2002. \n \nNow Mr. Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were my Uncle's \nsecond in command, has assumed office as leader of UNITA. In spite of \nthis, UNITA is like a herd of cattle without shepherd. Prominent members \nlike Carlos Morgado are still lobbying to oust them and assume office as \nleader to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to \ntheir ambitions, including General paula lukamba, are planning to kill \nme. For more information check www.angola.org. \n\nHowever, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any \nway interested in wars, this is why I secretly left Angola and come \nhere to England to seek political asylum.\n\n I am sincerely seeking for your urgent help in respect to safe keeping \nof some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money \n(US$18.5million), was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank \naccount. It was on transit with a safe deposit company here in England, \nwhen the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. \n\nAs a matter of fact, this is the reason I chose to come to England \nto seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are now, \nthat President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community to \nfreeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, since he \nhas already done this in Angola.\n\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential \nthat you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want \nto put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my \npart, in order not to lose this money. Please, treat this contact \nwith utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety \nreasons.\n\nThe help I need from you is clearing the box containing the funds \nfrom the security company, after which, it will be deposited in \nan account in your name, with my name as next of kin. The money \nshall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted, \nand I have the permit to conduct business, then you will transfer \nthe account to me. Meanwhile, the money can be invested into risk-free \nprofitable ventures, and there will an agreement to protect my \ninterest. I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment \nfrom the security company.\n\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15% of the money, \nand we shall use 5% to carry out every expenses that we come across \nduring the transaction and the investment process. The remainder of the \n5%, shall be given to a charity of your choice. Please send me your telephone and\nfax numbers, so that we can talk via phone, get to know each other better,\nand bring you closer to the picture. \n\nI thank you in advance in anticipation for your assistance in enabling \nme achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are \ninterested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in \nthe event of non-interest on your part.\n\nNOTE:your prompt response will be appreciated.\n \n\nSincerely,\n\nR.Savimbi.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4119818"}, {"subject": "??????? ???? ???? ????????

And so there was an idea to develop a query\nlanguage on a basis of URI syntax instead of SQL-like syntax.\nIt will be much more convenient for object-oriented tasks.\nHowever there were difficulties in the definition of such URI scheme.\nProbably, there are similar decisions and already developed query\nconstruction rules.\n\nIf you know about good ideas, please, give me references.\n\nIf this theme is interesting to you,\nI shall pass to technical details.\n\nAccording to URI Generic Syntax (RFC-2396) there would be\na following suitable format:\n\n  <scheme>://<authority>/<alias>/<path>?<conditions>#<fields>\n\nThe meaning of <scheme> and <authority> components are determined\nin the specified document;\n<alias> - specifies a database name;\n<path> - masks a path to object on a hierarchical key;\n<conditions> - specifies a selecting conditions;\n<fields> - defines a set of fields.\n\nLet's consider <path> component.\nFor object identification in the database a hierarchical key\nare used. It allows to build a tree as we usually do with\nfilesystem pathnames. In object-oriented languages it is\ncommon way to separate the path components by \".\" delimiter.\nURI gives certain freedom in <scheme-specific-part> definition,\nhowever it is accepted to use \"/\" for components separating.\nThe character \".\" is used in URI to separate a hierarchical\n<authority> name components. It would be necessary to know your\nopinion of this conflict solution.\n\nFore example, URI may look like:\n\n  uod://hostname.com/DatabaseName/Root.Node.Object\n\nThe primary applicability of the scheme is OODBMS queries.\nOn this, it is necessary to describe masking rules and\n<conditions> representation format.\nIt is convenient to use \"*\" for any character sequence masking\n(including empty), and \"**\" for masking any path component\nsequence.  Traditionally the masking symbol for one character\nis \"?\" but this symbol is used for <query> (or <conditions>\nin this case) component separating in URI string.\nExamples (it is obvious without explanation, i suppose):\n\n  /Root.*.Object1       /Root.**.Object1\n  /Root.abc!def.*       /Root.**.abc*def\n\nI shall notice that masked path may satisfy a set of objects\n(or empty set). How it will be represented in reply message is\nthe task of certain protocol.\n\nEach object in OODBMS can be also masked by Class name. For Class\nspecification we can use usual structure \"Object:Class\".\n\nUsing name and class mask together it is possible to create such\ncomplex expressions:\n\n  /Root.*:Class1.Object1\n  /Root.ab!!25*:*A\n  /Root.Node1.**.A*:Class1\n  /Root.A*:C,*A:D.Node1,Node7,Node8.Object1\n\nFor <conditions> specification it is possible to use any expression\nafter \"?\". The following examples demonstrate simple and complex\nconditions using mathematical operations, masking, enumeration, etc.:\n\n  /Root.Path.Object?Field1\n  /Root.Path.Object?Field1=Value1\n  /Root.Path.Object?(Field1+Field2)<Value1\n  /Root.Path.Object?Field1=Value1&Field2>=Value2\n  /Root.Path.Object?Field1=Value1,Value2\n  /Root.Path.Object?Field1=Value1..Value2\n  /Root.Path.Object?Field1=ab*cd!ef\n\nHere it is necessary to think about realization of complex conditions,\nfor example, if it is necessary to select objects on a logical\ncondition:\n\n  ( A>5 and B=8 and C<=3 ) or ( A<5 and B=2 and C<=100 )\n\nIn http URI it is accepted to express so:\n\n  ...?A>5&B=8&C<=3+A<5&B=2&C<=100\n\nVarious WEB searching systems converts a logical operation\n\"and\" into \"&\" character and logical \"or\" into \"+\". But a operation\norder can not be expressed so. Furthermore, the \"+\" in this example\ncan confuse a user because \"3+A\" is looked as a first priority\noperation.\n\nUsing brackets it is possible to writ out something like:\n\n  ...?(A>5&B=8&C<=3)+(A<5&B=2&C<=100)\nor\n  ...?((A>5)&(B=8)&(C<=3))+((A<5)&(B=2)&(C<=100))\n\nThis example can be also written down using words \"and\", \"or\":\n\n  ...?((A>5)and(B=8)and(C<=3))or((A<5)and(B=2)and(C<=100))\n\nThere is another variant of \"and\" coding using \";\", for\nexample \"A=2;B=3\". And if it is necessary to unite some\nconditions together through \"or\" operation we can write them so:\n\n  ...?<Condition1>?<Condition2>?<Condition3>\n\nFor example:\n\n  ...?A>5;B=8;C<=3?A<5;B=2;C<=100\n\nIf using of \"?\" is not desirable, it is possible to replace it\nwith \"/\", for example:\n\n  ...?<Condition1>/<condition2>/<condition3>\n\nIf you want to receive a table or a report form with listed fields\ninstead of a objects set as a query result, is possible is specify\na fields list. For example:\n\n  /Root.Object1#Field1,Field2,Field3\n\nUsing all URL components together:\n\n  /Root.**.Name!mask*:Class#Field1,Field2,Field3?Field4>5;Field5=ABCD\n\nI purposely use \"#\" before \"?\" because field list specification is\nlogically follows <path> component.\n\nIt is a large and complex topic, because such syntax can be used\nin any scheme solving data selecting task. I wait for your comments.\nThanks.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4191755"}, {"subject": "Re: URI applicatio", "content": "At 07:43 PM 12/19/02 +0200, Timur Shemsedinov wrote:\n>Using all URL components together:\n>\n>   /Root.**.Name!mask*:Class#Field1,Field2,Field3?Field4>5;Field5=ABCD\n>\n>I purposely use \"#\" before \"?\" because field list specification is\n>logically follows <path> component.\n\nI suggest you review this:\n\n   http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html\n\n#g\n\n\n-------------------\nGraham Klyne\n<GK@NineByNine.org>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4204504"}, {"subject": "??????! ???? ???? ?? ????????.[????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4212193"}, {"subject": "??????????,????????,??????????,?????????? ??????????[E??????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4218721"}, {"subject": "(????????).....?????? ????????..", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4225626"}, {"subject": "(????????).?????? ?????? ????... &lt;&lt;????&gt;&gt", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4231854"}, {"subject": "Programa Musical !!", "content": "Tecle e Toque - Programa Interativo de M?sica para Iniciantes\n\nSe voc? sempre sonhou em aprender tocar viol?o ou guitarra e sempre achou que\nn?o iria ser capaz, agora chegou a hora de aprender realmente.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.\n\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. \n\nMy Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek p!\nolitical asylum.\n\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. \n\nPresident Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.\n\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\n\nYour role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \n\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \n\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.\n\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \n\nPlease contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.\n\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the link below and read. \n\nhttp://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html\n\nSincerely,\nO.C.Savimbi.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4332250"}, {"subject": "[????]TOEIC?????? ???????? ??????!!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4342810"}, {"subject": "????????????????????????????100M????150???????????", "content": "????????????\n??????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,??????????????\n??????????????.????????????????:????????????!??????????:http://www.comdns.com\nemail:webmaster@comdns.com ??????\n????????????????????????????????????????????CGI??PHP??MYSQL??SQL??ACCESS??AS\nP????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n ????1??200M??????1??????????????????????????150??/????\n???? 2??60M??????60M??????????1??????????????????????????236??/????\n ????3??200M??????200M??????????1??????????????????????????336??/????\n     \n\n     ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n     1??????????????????????Dell PowerApp??????????????????\n     2??????????????????????Turbolinux??Microsoft??????????\n     3????????????????SNMP????24x7x365 ??????????\n     4????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n\n ????????????????????\n\n     ??????????????????????????????\n     ??????????????????266-268??????????7??\n     QQ:755139\n     ????:0592-5557492\n     ????:0592-5557491\n ????\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n????????????,??????????????????(http://www.21cmm.com)\n\n??CMM????(http://www.21cmm.com)????????????????\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4349323"}, {"subject": "????!

I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.\n\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. \n\nMy Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek p!\nolitical asylum.\n\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. \n\nPresident Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.\n\nI plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.\n\nYour role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. \n\nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \n\nI have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.\n\nI thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. \n\nPlease contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.\n\nTo know more about the struggle by UNITA to liberate Angola, click on the link below and read. \n\nhttp://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html\n\nSincerely,\nO.C.Savimbi.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-4701788"}, {"subject": "ONLY FOR YO", "content": "DEAR FRIEND,\n\nI AM MRS.SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU\nSESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE?

All Rights Reserved.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n   This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent\n   in a text string a Dial Sequence. A Dial Sequence is normally\n   composed by Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements [1] plus \n   separators and the additional \"actions\" (such as \"wait for\n   dialtone\", \"pause for N secs\", etc.) which could be needed to \n   successfully establish the connection with the target service:\n   this includes the cases where subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation \n   apply. Global Switched Telephone Numbers (GSTN) / E.164 addresses \n   (commonly called \"telephone numbers\") [2] are a subset of a Dial \n   Sequence, and thus use the same set of notations.\n\n   This notation MUST be used in all specifications needing a text\n   string representation of a Dial Sequence (including GSTN / E.164\n   addresses).\n\n\n1. Introduction\n\n   Since the very first devices interacting with GSTN services appeared, \n   a need for a unique text string representation of telephone numbers, \n   and more generally DTMF sequences and actions, was forseen.\n\n   This memo describes the full text string representation method. The\n   main scope is thus to provide a unique and complete reference for all\n   specification needing this representation. \n\n   Compatibility with existing Standard Track specifications (such as\n   [3] [4] [5] [6]) is also one of the most important issues in this \n   specification.\n\n\n1.1 Terminology and Syntax conventions\n\n   In this document the formal definitions are described using ABNF\n   syntax, as defined into [7].

The \"Dial Sequence\" definition\n\n   The possible elements composing a Dial Sequence can vary from a \n   minimum number up to a really large and complex collection: in\n   fact, already the sequences needed to dial a GSTN address, which is\n   a subset of the generic Dial Sequence, well represents this variety\n   and complexity of cases.\n\n   In particular, a Dial Sequence is composed by:\n\n   - \"DTMF elelments\": normally available as \"keys\" on numeric keypads\n     of dialling devices;\n\n   - \"actions\": normally performed by the agent (human or device) \n     composing the Dial Sequence;\n\n   - \"separators\": used only to improve human readibility of a Dial\n     Sequence.\n\n\n2.1 The \"phone-string\" definition\n\n   The text representation of the Dial Sequence elements is defined \n   into the phone-string specification:\n\n      phone-string = 1*( DTMF / pause / tonewait / written-sep )\n\n      DTMF = ( DIGIT / \"#\" / \"*\" / \"A\" / \"B\" / \"C\" / \"D\" )\n                     ; special DTMF codes like \"*\", \"#\", \"A\", \"B\",\n                     ; \"C\", \"D\" are defined in [1].\n                     ; Important Note: these elements only apply for\n                     ; alphabetic strings used in DTMF operations.\n                     ; They are NOT applicable for the alphabetic\n                     ; characters that are mapped to digits on phone\n                     ; keypads in some countries.\n\n      pause = \"p\"\n\n      tonewait = \"w\"\n\n      written-sep = ( \"-\" / \".\" )\n\n   Note:\n     DTMF are the \"DTMF elements\", pause and tonewait are the \"actions\"\n     and written-sep is the \"separators\".\n\n   The \"pause\" and \"tonewait\" elements interpretation in phone-string\n   depends on the specific devices and implementation using the\n   specification. Thus their exact meaning is not defined here as part\n   of this specification. The implementer's note below gives anyhow\n   some recommendations drown from common practice. Both \"pause\" and\n   \"tonewait\" are case insensitive.\n\n   Implementer's note:\n     - one instance of a \"pause\" is recommended to be interpreted as\n       a pause of one second between the preceding and succeeding dial\n       string element;\n     - a \"tonewait\" is recommended to be interpreted as a pause that \n       will last until the calling party hears a dial tone or another \n       indication that more dial string characters may be processed. \n       An off-hook indication may also be interpreted as this kind of \n       indication (meaning that the audio channel has been opened to \n       the receiving party);\n     - because these characters are not a part of the GSTN subscriber \n       address (telephone number) per se, any dial string characters \n       that succeed either a \"pause\" or \"tonewait\" should be sent using \n       DTMF signalling.\n\n   The use of written-sep elements is allowed in order to improve \n   human readibility of phone-string. The written-sep are elements\n   which can be placed between dial elements such as digits etc.\n   Any occurences of written-sep elements in a phone-string MUST NOT\n   result in any action. Conformant implementations MAY drop or\n   insert written-sep into the phone-string they handle.\n\n   The phone-string definition is used in the following sections to\n   explicitly describe the encoding of some specific subcases where\n   it applies.\n\n\n3. The \"gstn-phone\" definition\n\n   In order to access a GSTN address, a human or a device must perform\n   a Dial Sequence. Thus also a GSTN address can be represented using\n   the phone-string elements. In particual, standard E.164 numeric\n   addresses [2] represent a limited subset of all possible GSTN \n   addresses, while the complete complex case needs a full encoding \n   schema. \n\n   In order to describe this distinction and provide anyhow a complete\n   encoding schema, the following definition of \"gstn-phone\" is provided:\n\n      gstn-phone = ( global-phone / local-phone )\n\n\n3.1 The \"global-phone\" definition\n\n   The purpose of global-phone element is to represent standard E.164\n   numeric addresses. As such it uses a subset of phone-string \n   definition, only.\n\n   The syntax for global-phone element is as follows:\n\n      global-phone = \"+\" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )\n\n   Any other dialling schemes MUST NOT use the leading \"+\" defined here.\n   The \"+\" sign is strictly reserved for the standard \"global-phone\"\n   syntax, and, even if not specifically part of phone-string definition,\n   is needed to label uniquely a global-phone.\n\n\n3.2 The \"local-phone\" definition\n\n   The local-phone element is intended to represent the set of possible\n   cases where the global-phone numbering schema does not apply. Given\n   the different and complex conventions currently being used in the\n   GSTN system, the local-phone definition supports a large number of\n   elements.\n\n   The detailed syntax for local-phone elements follows:\n\n      local-phone =  [ exit-code ] dial-number\n\n      local-phone =/ exit-code [ dial-number ]\n\n      exit-code = phone-string\n                  ; this will include elements such as the digit to\n                  ; access outside line, the long distance carrier\n                  ; access code, the access password to the service,\n                  ; etc...\n\n      dial-number = phone-string\n                  ; this is in many cases composed of different elements\n                  ; such as the local phone number, the area code\n                  ; (if needed), the international country code\n                  ; (if needed), etc...\n\n   Notes:\n      the \"+\" character is reserved for use in global-phone and MUST NOT \n      be used in a local-phone string;\n\n      please note that a local-phone string MUST NOT be a null string,\n      i.e. at least an exit-code, or a dial-number or both MUST be\n      present.\n\n4. The \"subaddr-string\" definition\n\n   In GSTN service there are cases where a subaddress is required to\n   specify the final destination. To specify these subaddresses a Dial \n   Sequence is also used, and thus the \"subaddr-string\" can be encoded\n   as:\n\n      subaddr-string = phone-string\n\n   Note: \n      within actual uses of subaddresses, some specific services can\n      limit the possible set of phone-string elements allowed. In \n      particular there are ISDN subaddresses [2] [5], which restrict the \n      phone-string elements to 1*( DIGIT / written-sep ) and service \n      specific subaddresses, like the fax service T.33 subaddress [9]\n      [4] which restrict phone-string elements to 1*( DIGIT ).\n\n\n5. The \"post-dial\" definition\n\n   In some cases, after the connection with the destination GSTN device\n   has been established, a further dialling sequence is required to\n   access further services. A typical example is an automated menu-\n   driven service using DTMF sequences. These cases may be represented\n   using \"post-dial\" definition below:\n\n      post-dial = phone-string\n\n\n6. Examples\n\n   In order to clarify the specification we present here a limited set\n   of examples. Please note that all the examples are for illustration \n   purpouses, only.\n\n   A GSTN address in Italy, dialled from U.S.A., using local-phone, \n   without written-sep:\n\n      01139040226338\n\n   A GSTN address address in Germany, using global-phone and \n   written-sep \".\":\n\n      +49.81.7856345\n\n   A GSTN address in U.S.A. using global-phone and written-sep \"-\":\n\n      +1-202-455-7622\n\n   A post-dial sequence, pausing, dialling 1, waiting for dial tone, \n   dialling 7005393, waiting again for dial tone and dialling 373; \n   note the use of four \"p\" elements (pppp) to specify a longer initial\n   pause:\n\n      pppp1w7005393w373\n\n   A Dial Sequence in Italy (long distance call), using local-phone, \n   with exit-code \"9\", long distant access \"0\", area code \"40\",\n   pause \"p\" and written-sep \".\":\n\n      9p040p22.63.38\n\n   A Dial Sequence using exit-code \"0\", a wait for dial tone, \n   local-phone for an International \"800\" toll-free number dialled\n   from Beglium (international prefix \"00\"), and a post-dial sequence \n   to access a voice mailbox with userID \"334422\" and Personal \n   Identification Number (PIN) code \"1234\":\n\n      0w00800-39380023pp334422p1234\n\n7. Conclusions\n\n   This proposal creates a full standard text encoding for Dial\n   Sequences, including GSTN / E.164 addresses, and thus provides a\n   unique common representation method both for standard protocols\n   and applications. \n\n   Some definitions, like these corresponding to an alias of the generic \n   phone-string element, are somewhat a theoretical distinction; however\n   they are useful to provide a more subtle distinction, allowing other\n   specifications to be more exact in a consistent way, too.\n\n   The proposal is consistent with existing standard specifications.\n\n\n8. Security Considerations\n\n   This document specifies a means to represent Dial Sequences, which\n   thus could include GSTN addresses, and private codes sequences,\n   like Personal Identification Numbers, to access special services.\n   As these text strings could be transmitted without encoding inside\n   protocols or applications services, this could allow unauthorized\n   people to gain access to these codes. Users SHOULD be provided methods\n   to prevent this disclosure, like code encryption, or masquerading\n   techniques: out-of-band communication of authorization information or\n   use of encrypted data in special fields are the available non-standard\n   techniques.\n\n\n9.

There is an issue\non the plate of the DNSEXT working group that may be of concern to\nAPPS folks, so I encourage folks to read the salient drafts and\nconsider comments to the chairs and working group on the issue.\nAs many of you know, the DNSEXT working group is currently\nworking on several revisions to the DNSSEC specs.  It hopes that after\nthose revisions have gone through that several barriers to the use of\nDNSSEC will be lowered enough that we will see significant deployment.\nOne of the current proposals, \"opt-in\",\n(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-opt-in-01.txt)\nproposes a mechanism by which a zone could have both secured and\nunsecured nodes (collections of RRs associated with a specific name).\nThe mechanism by which it does this eliminates one of the data\nintegrity elements of the original DNSSEC specs: authenticated denial\nof existence for an unsecured node.  Denial of existence in this model\nwould remain more or less as it is in the current DNS (an unsigned\nassertion).\nThough there has been some security review of the loss of this\nelement of DNSSEC, there hasn't been much review by APPS folks, and I\nbelieve that would be useful.  The basic question is: if the DNS data\nintegrity model assures that the data returned by a query is the data\nplaced in the DNS by the zone administrator, but does not provide data\nintegrity for denial of existence of nodes in opt-in zones, will it\nmeet the security requirements of your application? \nAny thought you can put into the question would be appreciated.\nregards,\nTed Hardie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-5579252"}, {"subject": "?????? ??????, ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????????[????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-5587081"}, {"subject": "?????? ???? ??????????????(????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-5593897"}, {"subject": "Tilde in URL", "content": "Is the tilde character (~) still an unsafe character\nin URLs, which should be encoded as %7E.

I also suggested that\n\"Content-Type: multipart/choices\" should have the\n'differences' parameter, as proposed in RFC 1766,\nmandatory, to avoid the same problem repeating itself in\nthe future if new kinds of differences are used.\n\nIn discussion of this in this mailing list mainly between\nFebruary and June 2001, several people objected to the\nintroduction of a new variant \"Content-Type: choices\" when\nthe standards already had \"Content-Type: alternative\".\n\nBecause of this, I have been thinking about alternatives to\na new Content-Type, and which would still work acceptably\nwith the installed base of mailers.\n\nJust saying that \"Multipart/Alternative\" should be used\ncombined with \"Content-Language\" is *not* a viable\nsolution, because it works so very badly with the installed\nbase of mailers.\n\nBecause of this, I have submitted a new version of\ndraft-palme-e-mail-translation-03.txt which proposes a new\nsolution to this problem.\n\nMy new idea is to use \"Multipart/alternative\" but to have\nthe following set of alternative content parts:\n\n(1)           Plain text, all language versions concatenated within\n               the text of one body part.\n\n(2) .. (n-1) The different language versions, one part\n              for each language.\n\n(n)          HTML, all language versions concatenated within the\n              text of the body part, adding a \"table of contents\" at the\n              top with a list of the languages and internal links to the\n              part of the HTML with each language.\n\nI am sure people will not like this solution either. But\nthose who do not like either of my solutions, should then\npropose a third solution which works also with the\ninstalled base of mailers. Proposing to use\n\"Multipart/alternative\" combined with one body part for\neach language will *never* work. No mailer will want to\nsend a message in a format which will be misunderstood\ndisastrously by most of the installed base of mailers.\n\nMy new solutions has two disadvantages: It is not neat, and\nthe text is copied three times. It has, however, a major\nadvantage: It will work acceptably well with the installed\nbase, and it will work best, of course, with mailers\nsupporting the new standard.\n\nThat the text is repeated three times is not a major\nproblem since users will only see one of the parts,\nand bandwith is not expensive. That the solution is\nnot neat is not a major advantage, it is a long\ntradition in IETF to prefer solutions which works to\nsolutions which are neat. No one has said that encoding\nbinary or 8-bit text as 7-bit text in MIME is neat.\nBut it was chosen in order to work acceptably with\nthe installed base of MTAs and MUAs.\n\n>To: IETF-Announce: ;\n>From: Internet-Drafts@ietf.org\n>Reply-to: Internet-Drafts@ietf.org\n>Subject: I-D ACTION:draft-palme-e-mail-translation-03.txt\n>Date: Wed, 09 Jan 2002 16:05:40 -0500\n>Sender: scoya@cnri.reston.va.us\n>\n>\n>\n>A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line \n>Internet-Drafts directories.\n>\n>\n>Title: Support for Language Translation \n>in E-Mail and Netnews\n>Author(s): J.

It is one thing to avoid breaking implementations coded in\ngood faith to the standards of the time, it is quite another thing to attempt\nto cater to implementations that weren't coded very well to begin with.\n\nSecond, in the case of quoted-printable, we also attempted to finesse the\nbackwards compatibility issue somewhat by defing an encoding that would be\npartly readable. However, this attempt was, in retrospect, a nearly complete\nfailure. In hindsight, it may have been more trouble than it was worth.\n\nIn summary, you win few if any points in this debate by comparing what you're\nproposing to quoted-printable.\n\n> Why should not a graceful downgrading to existing mailers\n> be important for language translation in e-mail, when\n> it was so very important in the design of MIME itself?\n\nSee above -- the comparison isn't as apt as you seem to think, and even if it\nwere apt you're basically saying we should repeat something that didn't work\nthe first time.\n\nAn additional point. The pent up demand for MIME in the early 90s was enormous.\nA standardized message format for internationalized text and material other\nthan text was urgently needed. This more than anything else drove the\ndeployment of MIME support, and even then deployment was pretty slow. By\ncontrast, the demand for language translation support in email is minimal at\nbest. I know it is something you want very badly, but how many other people\nwant it? Uptake of other MIME enhancements or extensions that require\nsubstantial UA changes has been sporadic at best, and seems largely related to\nthe perceived needs of the vendors themselves, not a desire for full standards\ncompliance.\n\nBecause of this I fear that any proposal you make (other than one where you\nsimply use multipart/mixed rather than multipart/alternative) is going to\nsuffer the same fate as the attempt to use content-language fields to select\nbetween alternative parts. Simply put, while what you are doing is arguably\na legitimate standards exercise, I see little chance of change in the real\nworld because of it.\n\nThere are, however, two alternate approaches that immediately come to mind\nthat might work better:\n\n(1) Do some coding work yourself.

E-mail already has a facility for sending a message\nin different formats to different recipients. This is the\n\"Bcc\" header. But most existing mailers, I believe, does\nnot implement this by actually sending different messages\nto different recipients. Instead, they only send a single\nmessage, with no Bcc content to any of the recipients.\n(Which is allowed by the standards, but still not a full\nimplementation of Bcc.)\n\nAnother disadvantage with sending only one language version\nto each recipient is that some recipients may want a\nmessage in more than one translation. They may, for\nexample, want to check if the translation was OK, and, if\nnot, maybe want to submit their own translation. Especially\nif the original translation was made by a machine, this\nmight be a reasonable need. Of course, a registry system\ncould allow such people to register that they want a\nmessage in more than one language. This will however only\nwork if such people have a mailer supporting the combination\nof multipart/alternative with content-language.\n\n-- \nJacob Palme <jpalme@dsv.su.se> (Stockholm University and KTH)\nfor more info see URL: http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-5852817"}, {"subject": "Re: I-D ACTION:draft-palme-e-mail-translation03.tx", "content": "> I do not agree.

That doesn't mean, however, that such a\n>representation would meet the quality for standards-track documents\n>or that vendors would implement it.\n\nI believe that the first implementations will be a few\nvendors who provide *sending* of messages in multiple\nlanguages. For example, SYSTRAN might develop and market a\ntranslation agent, which a company can install, and which\nwill, at the request of their users, forward a message with\nmachine translations to different target languages. Or\nSYSTRAN might set up such a service on their own servers,\nwhich will receive mail in one language and forward it in\nmultiple languages.\n\nIf the above service becomes successful and much used,\nthen as a second step one might expect existing vendors\nof receiving mailers to be able to select the right\nbody part dependent on the user's preferences.\n\nBecause I expect that senders will implement the new\nstandard before recipients, it is very important that the\nstandard works well for receiving mail UAs which do not yet\nsupport the standard.\n\nA good standard should of course support both your choices\n#1 and #2. Using multipart/alternative has the advantage,\nthat in some far future, when all receiving UAs will\nsupport this, one can omit the extra body part at the start\nand end of the messages, and thus get the neat solution\nwhich one would prefer in a standard.\n-- \nJacob Palme <jpalme@dsv.su.se> (Stockholm University and KTH)\nfor more info see URL: http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-5907657"}, {"subject": "Re: I-D  ACTION:draft-palme-e-mail-translation03.tx", "content": "I do not think this will work. When I tested sending\nmultipart/alternative with different languages in different\nbody parts, then most existing mailers just showed either\nthe first or the last body part, without even telling me\nthat there were any other body parts, or giving me any\noption to select a particular body part.\n\nBecause of this, my conclusion is that if you use\nmultipart/alternative with different languages in different\nbody parts, then the first and the last body parts must\nboth of them contain a concatenation of all the languages.\n\nDid I correctly understand your proposal?\n\nAt 11.31 -0500 02-01-17, Cyrus Daboo wrote:\n>--On Thursday, January 17, 2002 11:21 AM +0100 Jacob Palme \n><jpalme@dsv.su.se> wrote:\n>\n>>(b) multipart/alternative, with an additional first and\n>>      last body part containing a concatenation of all the\n>>      translations.\n>\n>I have another suggestion here based on the MIME pre-amble \n>text you sometimes see at the top of MIME messages which \n>is an indicator that your client does not support MIME.\n>\n>Do what you suggestion above, but instead of making the \n>special first and last parts a concatenation of each \n>translation, use some descriptive text in each of the \n>languages of the other parts explaining that this is a \n>multi-lingual alternative MIME message, e.g. (for English):\n>\n>    This message has been written in different languages.

It\n         is assumed that all attendees will have read the\n         drafts in advance of the meeting.\n\n         For documents that are work-in-progress, the\n         presentation should cover issues resolved since\n         the last draft followed by open issues and\n         controversial topics with the intent to reach a\n         resolution of said issues and topics.\n\n         For new work items, the presentation should focus on\n         what the problem is and why it is necessary for the\n         work group to address it.  Further it should be either\n         shown how it falls within the existing charter or why\n         and how the charter should be extended to encompass it.\n         The solution should only be sketched.\n\n         The appropriate way of bringing new work to the working\n         group is to send a draft to the mailing list and promoting\n         discussion on the list.

Sese-seko\n\nI am Mrs Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am move to write this letter, this was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation.  I escaped along with my husband and two other of our son Kennedy and Basher out of Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC) to Abidjan, Cote D'ivoire were my family and I settled, while we later \nmoved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. \n\nHowever due to this situation we decided to changed most of my husband billions of dollars deposited in Swiss Bank and other Countries into other forms of money coded for safe deposit because the new Head of State of (DR) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement to the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband treasures deposit in some Europeans countries.\n\nHence my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things get better, like now that President  Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's  Chateaux in southern France was confiscated by the French government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. I have deposited the sum of Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) with a security company, for \nsafekeeping. The funds are coded to prevent them from knowing the content. \n\nWhat I want you to do is to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our behalf. Acnowledge this message, so that I can introduce you to my son (kennedy) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said fund. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also like to buy \nproperties and stock in multi-national companies to engage in other safe and non-speculative investment. \n\nMay I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, Which this business demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which I repose in you. In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son shall put you in the picture of the business, tell you were the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss other modalities including renumeration for you services. \n\nFor this reason kindly furnish us your contact information, that is your personal telephone and fax number for confidential purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail.\n\nBest regards,\nMrs M.

RDMA capabilities refer to the ability to place data directly\nfrom the NIC into application buffers, without intensive CPU\nusage. This strategy avoids the costs of data copying and enables\nusing IP as a method for high speed buffer to buffer transfer,\nallowing IP to replace special purpose networks currently in use.\n\nConceptually, RDMA functionality can be viewed as consisting of two\nlayers. First the direct data placement capability, which is\naccomplished through a tag and a lookup table on the NIC. Above this\ncore functionality, an RDMA control protocol is needed to specify how\n\nthe direct data placement can be used, for example READ and WRITE\ncommands.\n\nThe work of the WG is to accomplish three items:\n\n1) A (transport independent) protocol core to support direct data\n   placement from the NIC into specified memory, usually application    \n   buffers.\n\n2) A (transport independent) protocol core layered on top of the direct\n   data placement protocol that specifies control of RDMA.\n\n3) A mapping of the direct data placement protocol and the RDMA control\n   protocol to SCTP.\n\n\n\n \n\n---------- End Forwarded Message ----------\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7099724"}, {"subject": "[????]???????? ????/??????.?????? ???? ?????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7109185"}, {"subject": "(????????) ?????? ?????????? ????&ndash;&ndash;???????? ???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7116000"}, {"subject": "???C?C?s???W?????A?[???C?C?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7122735"}, {"subject": "[?? ?? ?? ??]???? ????????.. 100% ??????...?????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7129285"}, {"subject": "????????!  ?????? ????????.

This should \n normally not be a requirement, but when you understand the \n transaction then you will understand why it is important that you \n live far away from me. \n \n c. The amount of money involved in this transaction is \n US$18,500,000.00, which is too much for a man of modest means like my \n self to handle in my country. \n \n I believe from my few points above, you can begin to get an idea why \n I need your participation. \n \n Let me explain how the money, which is the basis of this business I \n am proposing, came about. Before I became a deputy director, some \n years ago I used to be Accounts Officer to some special corporate \n customers. One of these very important customers of our bank(Union \n Bank PLC) was Engineer Mohammed Bin Waseem an Arabian citizen, who \n had spent most of his years before his death working in Africa and \n mostly in Nigeria. He died in a plane crash in 1996 in Nigeria. \n \n This money belonged to him. Technically speaking now,it belongs only \n to his name. The money is payment he received for a contract he \n executed on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing for \n the government. \n \n My reason for deciding to carry out this transaction is that Engr. \n Waseem did not mention any next of kin in any of the documents held \n by the bank for the number of years he had banked with us. Since 1996 \n we have searched for any body that could be related to Engr. Waseem, \n I was \n mandated by the bank to search for a relation of Engr. Waseem and I \n did this from January 1997 to December 1999 after which the search \n was called off in the belief that soon a relative may turn up to \n claim his estate. Nevertheless, as it is, there is no relative. \n \n Now, the Chairman of the bank who is a retired soldier has indicated \n his intentions for the money. During the last meeting of Directors \n and Deputies, he said that he would donate the money to a military \n trust if it is not claimed soon, this invariably means the continuous \n flow of more arms and ammunition. I know for sure that not all of the \n money will go to the military trust some will surely line his pockets \n and that of anybody who is in support of his plan. \n \n My plan is to get a trust worthy person that can, under my constant \n guidance present him self as a cousin to the late Engr. Waseem. I \n want you to note that your citizenship does not matter; \n \n You do not have to be an Arabian. The papers demanded by the normal \n procedure for the claiming of an inheritance will take care of \n everything. You will be sole beneficiary to the estate of Engr. \n Waseem. All I need is for you to follow my instructions closely \n because I am experienced in inheritance matters here and I am on \n ground here to advice you on every step until you receive the money. \n Then we meet. \n \n For your participation, we will allow you 30% of the gross. All \nexpenses incurred in the process of this transaction will be deducted \nform the gross value and shared at a commensurate ratio; this we will \n done at the end of the transaction, because the money is bonded. \n \nAn estimated 10% or less will cover all incidental expenses and we \n will take 60% for ourselves. The most important thing to me right now \n is trust on both sides. Now the money is still in the care of the \n bank, I hope the trust will still be there when we must have legally \n established your relationship as cousin to Engr. Waseem and the \n money is paid to you. I need also to trust that you will not tell \n people or your bank about this business. Collect the money first then \n I get my share, then you can tell any body what you chose. I shall \n need your help to invest in your country; therefore, any experience \n you have in this area will be beneficial. \n \n Surely, you must have some questions or may be you just need further \n clarification. I will be happy to receive a mail  from you \n  to this effect, this will enable me explain further \n what the next step is and the general plan. I will also need your \n most confidential telephone number and fax number, if you have a \n mobile phone I believe it will help so that I can reach you anytime. \n \n Please kindly respond by email only \n \n Your positive and negative response is highly welcome. \n \n \n \n Dr. Salma Abdu.\n\n\n\napplication/octet-stream attachment: a4.txt\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7831937"}, {"subject": "Kindly Get Back To Me Pleas", "content": "                CONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL\n\nYou may be surprised to receive this letter from me, since you do not know me personally. I am ABDUL MOMOH, the son of NDIATA MOMOH, the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe. He was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network\nonline hence decided to write you. \n\nBefore the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from Security Company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the\nsociety. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims.\n\nIt is against this background that, my family and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and more so, have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to have such amount of money in any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction of such magnitude throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands.\n\nAs the first son, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South \nAfrica for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history.\n\nAs a businessman, I am seeking for a partner, who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands. I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist my family, and me all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangement with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands. I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought from South Africa to The Netherlands. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of \nownership of the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment.\n\nI have two options for you. Firstly I can give you certain percentage of the money for for agreeing to assist in this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment in your country. Whichever option you want, feel free to notify\nme. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. Contact me with this E-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this  transaction. \n\nThanks, GOD BLESS YOU\n\nYours Faithfully,\nAbdul Momoh.\n  \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7842774"}, {"subject": "????!!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7851916"}, {"subject": "[?? ??] ???????????? ???????? ?????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7857975"}, {"subject": "{ ???????? } ???????? ???? ???????? ???????? ????????.??????!!", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7864582"}, {"subject": "[?? ??] ???? ???????? ???????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7871500"}, {"subject": "[????????] ???????? 39,000?? / ???????? 7,900?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7878034"}, {"subject": "???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ????????????..???????? ???????? ??????..??/??/??/?", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-7884715"}, {"subject": "Confidential Proposa", "content": "                        REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP\n\n \n\nThis letter is important, and requires your immediate attention!\n\nFirstly, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. \n\n I am a top official of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel, I am currently on official assignment here in The Netherlands.

The said investment now valued at US$18,500,000.00 million was originally purchased by Mr Lucio Manfred and leased to a company the Transvaal Orange mining corporation in 1979. Since the maturity of the contract in September 1989 several attempts have been made without success to contact Mr Lucio manfred or any of his relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid.\nMy partner who is the accounts director at the ministry of mining and two of our colleagues have initiated the process of filling a claim for this money with the hope of having the funds transferred abroad. We request therefore that you let my partners file a claim for this money from South Africa ministry of mining and natural resources indicating that you where appointed by Mr Lucio Manfred to be the beneficiary of this funds. When the claim is approved, you as the beneficiary will be paid the sum of US$18,500,000.00 United States Dollars. Since this money will be paid directly to any bank account of your choice you are liable to ensure that my partners and I receive 75% of the total sum while you keep 25%for your services. Please we urge you to keep this matter very confidential because we are still in active public service in South Africa.\nI want to assure you that my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a stong guarantee that our share will be well secured and that you will not take advantage of our position since the money will be transfered directly to your bank you are nominating.\nBe rest assured that there is absolutely nothing to worry about in view of this claim. It is perfectly safe with no risks involved and it is not subject to any enquiry since my partners will be handling it directly in South Africa on your behalf.\nI do hope my proposal is acceptable to you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter so that I can provide you with more clarification about the claim and how we intend to make this deal beneficial to everyone involved.\nPlease for urgent response contact me through this email address.\nYours truly,\nAbudu Masabela.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8287270"}, {"subject": "[ ?? ?? ] ???? ?? ???? ?????? ????  ???????? ???????? , ?????? ???? ..", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8295821"}, {"subject": "??????????

The purpose of my introduction is that I am Ben Henty Malaga the first son of Henty Magama one of the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you.  Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of USD$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the \nsociety. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims.\n It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and recurrently staying in the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything  we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them.\n I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future; both countries have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I what you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds)from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands's I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then \nall modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment.\n I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in  the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above E-mail addressee, while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.\n Thanks, GOD BLESS \nYours Faithfully,\nBEN  HENTY MAGAMA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napplication/octet-stream attachment: paul.txt\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8393701"}, {"subject": "(????????????) ?? ???? ????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8403602"}, {"subject": "draft-shemsedinov-usp05.tx", "content": "I have as Area Director got a request to publish the named I-D as \nInformational RFC.

I believe that XML has all possibilities for\na complex data structure definition, however it does not provide sufficient\npossibilities, fixed at a syntax level, for the object definition.\nIt is possible to describe objects, but there is some freedom degree\nin the invention of ways to do it.

We should (hopefully) all be able to agree on the following\nfacts:\n\n1) Both standards can support any trust model and either seems to\nadequately provide MIME security.\n2) Neither PGP nor S/MIME has had any serious market acceptance to date.\n3) The market has not chosen one over another.\n\nHowever, the implications of these facts are very much open to debate.\nPersonally, I draw the exactly opposite conclusion than you.  I think\nthe IESG policy is correct, in that it implements a critical concept\nfrom RFC 1958, Architectural Principles of the Internet, Section 3.2:\n\n  \"If there are several ways of doing the same thing, choose one.\"\n\nIn my mind, the analogy to the standards world is the relative failure\nof US 2G cellular standards (TDMA vs. CDMA) vs. a single European\nstandard (GSM) that was adopted around the world.  The market (in the\nUS) was never able to pick one standard.  In Europe, an (arguably)\ninferior technology -- GSM -- was mandated, but the lack of options\ncaused widespread adoption (and also resulted in all the inferior\naspects being fixed).\n\nThat is, although there is a history of standards bodies pushing a\ntechnology that was not adopted (e.g., OSI), there is also a history\nwhere selection of one standard caused ubiquitous penetration.  Another\nanalogy is that neither VHS nor Betamax took off until one of them died\noff (in that case due to market acceptance, not standards bodies), where\nDVD penetration has grown far faster because there was only one format.\n\nBTW, the other relevant examples that come to mind are more ambiguous.\nSIPP was selected for IPv6 over TUBA, but penetration is obviously still\nvery weak.  Also, IKE was chosen over SKIP, and penetration is still\nonly so-so, though much better than if there were two incompatible\nstandards.\n\n          - dan\n--\nDan Kohn <mailto:dan@dankohn.com>\n<http://www.dankohn.com/>  <tel:+1-650-327-2600>  \n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Dave Crocker [mailto:dcrocker@brandenburg.com] \nSent: Thursday, November 07, 2002 11:32\nTo: Paul Hoffman / IMC\nCc: Dave Crocker; discuss@apps.ietf.org\nSubject: Re: Mandatory MIME security\n\n\nPaul,\n\n\nThursday, November 7, 2002, 11:19:49 AM, you wrote:\nPaul> Whoops, sorry.

So as a general principle, a standards \ngroup should be aware of how things are faring in the market, but a \nstandards group which cares about technical excellence should not always \nfollow to the market.  Standards groups can and should push the market to \ndo better technically where it is feasible.  Security, in particular, is \none area where the standards should lead the market because markets have a \ntendancy not to demand security until it is too late to deploy it.\n\nThat said, I happen to think both PGP and S/MIME are currently failures. \nPGP has only deployed significantly in the individual geek market.  S/MIME \nhas only deployed significantly in security-sensitive companies and \ngovernment offices.  By \"deployed\", I mean end-users actually use it rather \nthan products ship with support for it.\n\nMy speculation of why both PGP and S/MIME are failures in the larger market \nis that the concept of client certificates is simply too complex or \ncumbersome for the average end-user absent a deployed global smart-card \nstandard.  But it could also be because the standards haven't placed \nsufficient requirements on user interfaces and the bootstrap problem or \nthat the products to date haven't focused enough on usability to be \nactually usable by the average end-user.\n\nSo where does that leave us?  If the IETF produces a hop-to-hop protocol \nwhich can transport non-public data and wants it to be technically \ncompetent, we must require some sort of interoperable security that's \nbetter than unencrypted plain text passwords.  But the two standards track \nprotocols we have for object security are currently failures and I agree \nwith Dave that they are unreasonable to mandate.  Personally, I think the \nanswer is that whenever the IETF produces a hop-to-hop protocol we mandate \nthe use of a hop-to-hop layer which provides a deployable security \nmechanism such as TLS with plaintext passwords, or an SSH-style \nDiffie-Hellman exchange.  In theory, it doesn't provide as good security as \nS/MIME or PGP/MIME, but in practice it provides better security because it \nwill deploy and be used in the larger market.\n\nBut we do need to allow for optional S/MIME and PGP/MIME security because I \nbelieve a global smart card standard will deploy eventually and then they \nwill be an improvement over what we can deploy now.\n\n                - Chris\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8684966"}, {"subject": "Re: Mandatory MIME securit", "content": "At 08:39 AM 11/7/2002 -0800, Dave Crocker wrote:\n>Folks,\n>\n>The IESG is now operating with the policy that application protocols must\n>mandate implementation of (at least one) strong security mechanism.

I'd say all of the following SASL mechanisms \nhave characteristics that make them worth using in some scenarios: PLAIN, \nDIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, OTP, Kerberos, SRP, SecureID.  Plus it would be \npossible to develop a few more that would also fill useful market niches.\n\n> But SASL is not just a negotiation framework.  It is a common\n> representation framework.

That's what Multipart MIME Security was intended to be.\n> The problem is that it isn't used much or at all by the two standards.\n\nI'm somewhat dubious of the value of Multipart MIME Security.  Because \nobject-security is most useful in an enviornment where negotiation is not \nan option, the number of useful fundamental mechanisms I can think of ends \nup in the 2-3 range rather than the 8-12 range.\n\n> The other is to revive the simple PKI effort, to get a basic mechanism\n> that supports only a core set of cert functionality -- rather than the\n> cornucopia of policies that have been pursued -- and that scales but\n> is real, real easy to use.\n\nA major problem is that the customers who pay real money for \ntop-of-the-line object security have already choosen S/MIME and have little \ninterest in any alternative.  That leaves most large companies with no will \nto expend resources on the larger problem of deployable object security.\n\nWhile it would be entertaining to try a 4th attempt at application-level \nobject security (preferably this time with more input from application \nexperts and less from security purists), I think the odds of succeeding \nhave decreased significantly since the last 3 attempts.  If you really \nwanted to pursue this direction, here's what I think it would take to \nsucceed:\n1) Really good open-source implementations with free-for-commercial use \nlicense, at least one in C and one in Java.\n2) Transition strategy from existing PKI systems that works and is included \nin 1.\n3) A really good spec, that includes good discussion about user interface \nrequirements and how to deploy the system into an untrained average user \ncommunity (likely involving automatic fetching of generated private keys \nover the Internet using TLS and a username/password pair).\n4) A major vendor or consortium backing the effort with enough clout to get \nthe attention of the trade rags.\n\nOf these, 1 and 2 are just plain hard, 3 goes against IETF traditions \nenough that I think the IETF would be the wrong standards group to do this \nin, and 4 may be nearly impossible in the current business climate.\n\n                - Chris\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8778609"}, {"subject": "(????)?????? ???", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8791046"}, {"subject": "(????)3??????????8?????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8797209"}, {"subject": "Re: Mandatory MIME securit", "content": "begin  quotation by Andrew Newton on 2002/11/8 12:35 -0500:\n> Others that I know who have done informal surveys of \"average\" computer\n> users also state that the complexity of client certificates is the reason\n> for low adoption.

When the problem is that \na protocol lacks a capability, then the IETF needs to get involved. \nWhen the problem is the UI, fix the UI  -- AND ANY UNDERLYING \nINFRASTRUCTURE IT REQUIRES.\n\nUIs can require significant redesign in order to make use of a \nparticular mechanism.  For example, we had a product that we attempted \nto transition into COPS-PR, and we were told by UI experts that  because \nof the different levels of abstraction, there was no way to have a UI \nthat uses both COPS-PR and the previous mechanism in which they would \nboth work in an intuitive fashion.\n\nNow, this certainly had implications for the COPS-PR protocol.  Assuming \nothers ran into the same problem, there was no way to migrate legacy \napplications.  But here's the key: not a single person in the IETF \nidentified this as a showstopper.  And why should we have?  We don't \nhave the expertise in user interface design.\n\nNow here we are worrying about user interfaces and the lack of market \nuptake in end to end messaging security.  It could well be that we \nhaven't found the RIGHT UI.  But how can we tell?  We might even have \nthe right mechanisms, but that they are not well organized to a user's \nliking.

At first, I was \nsceptical too, and was thinking that this was some kind of \njoke. That one would send money and never receive anything. \nBut I gave it a try anyway and IT REALLY WORKS! \n\nMAKE 50,000$$$ IN LESS THAN 90 DAYS! \n\nThank you for your time and Interest. The following income opportunity \nis one that can be started with VERY LITTLE investment and the income \nreturn is TREMENDOUS!!! \n\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \nIf you would like to make at least $50,000 in less than 90 days! Please \nread the enclosed program... THEN READ IT AGAIN!!! \n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \n\nAt first, I was sceptical too, but I decided to give it a try and it \nreally WORK! \n\nLEGITIMATE AND LEGAL \n\nTHIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY. \n It does not require you to come into contact with people, \n do any hard work and best of all, you never have to leave \n the house except to get the mail. If you believe that someday \n you'll get that big break that you've been waiting for, \n THIS IS IT! Simply follow the instructions, \n and your dreams will come true. This e-mail marketing \n program works perfectly...100%, EVERY TIME. E-mail is the \n sales tool of the future. Take advantage of this \n non-commercialized method of advertising NOW!!! The \n longer you wait, the more people will be doing business using \n e-mail. Get your piece of this program now! \n\n MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained \n respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business \n School, both Stanford Research and the Wall Street \n Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods \n and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the \n late 1990's. This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of \n the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made \n their fortune in the last few years in MLM. Moreover, \n statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday \n through Multi-Level Marketing. \n\n You may have heard this story before, but over the summer \n Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman \n Show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost \n everything and had to start over from scratch. Without \n hesitating, Trump said he would find a good network \n marketing company and get to work. The audience started \n to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and \n dead-panned his response - \"That's why I'm sitting up here \n and you are all sitting out there!\" \n\n With network marketing you have two sources of income. \n Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and \n commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the \n business. \n\n Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means \n investing time or money once and getting paid again and \n again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting \n paid for the work of others. \n\n The enclosed information is something I almost let slip \n through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I re-read \n everything and gave some thought and study to it. \n\n My name is Ellie Gilbert. Two years ago, the \n corporation I worked for, the past twelve years, down-sized \n and my position was eliminated. After many unproductive job \n interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the \n past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I \n owed my family, friends and creditors over $40,000.. \n I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance \n and borrow against my home to support  my family and \n struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something \n significant happened in my life and I am writing to share \n the experience in hopes that this will change your life, \n FINANCIALLY, FOREVER!!! \n\n In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six \n month's prior to receiving this program I had been sending \n away for information on various business opportunities. All of \n the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost \n effective. They were either too difficult for me to \n comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to \n risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I \n would make a million dollars in one year...it didn't tell me \n I'd have to write a best selling book to make it! \n\n But, as I was saying, in December of 1997 I received this \n program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it, they just got my \n name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT! \n After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it \n correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY \n MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I \n wanted to start, without putting me further into debt. After I \n got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get \n my money back. But like most of you I was still a little \n skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. \n So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725- \n 2161 24-hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! \n After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A \n CHAIN LETTER, I decided \"WHY NOT.\" \n\n Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. The great thing \n about e-mail is that I don't need any money for printing \n to send out the program, and because \n all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail, the only expense is my \n time. I'm telling you as it is, I hope it doesn't turn you off, \n but I promised myself that I would not \"rip-off\" anyone, no \n matter how much money it cost me. \n\n In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for \n REPORT #1. By January 13, I had received 26 orders for \n REPORT #1. \n Your goal is to \"RECEIVE at least 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN 2 \nWEEKS. \n If you don't, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!\" \n\n My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. \n\n By January 30, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2. \n Your goal is to \"RECEIVE AT LEAST 100+ ORDERS FOR \n REPORT #2 WITHIN 2 WEEKS. IF NOT, SEND OUT \n MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. ONCE YOU HAVE \n 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL \n MAKE YOUR $50,000 GOAL.\" Well, I had 196 orders for \n REPORT #2, 96 more than I needed. So I sat back and \n relaxed. \n By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received \n $58,000 with more coming in every day. \n\n I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. \n Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL \n CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER! Remember, it won't \n work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must \n follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place \n your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out \n on a lot of money! In order for this program to work, you \n must meet your goal of 20+ orders for REPORT #1, and \n 100+ orders for REPORT #2 and you will make $50,000 or \n more in 90 days. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS! \n\n If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It \n really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If \n you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be \n on your way to financial security. \n\n If you are a business owner and in financial trouble, \n as I was, or you want to start your own business, consider \n this a good luck sign. I DID! \n\n Sincerely, \n\n Ellie Gilbert \n\n P.S. Do you have any idea what $58,000 looks like \n piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME! \n  \n\n A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \n\n By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports \n you should have concluded that such a program, one \n that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur. \n\n Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable \n business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began \n falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously \n successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it \n out. It wasn't me, it was the economy. Inflation and \n recession had replaced the stable economy that had been \n with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened \n to the unemployment rate... because many of you know from \n first hand experience. There were more failures and \n bankruptcies than ever before. \n\n The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what \n they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who \n did not, including those who never had anything to save or \n invest, were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the \n saying goes, \"THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR \n GET POORER.\" The traditional methods of making money \n will never allow you to \"move up\" or \"get rich\". \n\n You have just received information that can give you \n financial freedom for the rest of your life, with \"NO RISK\" and \n \"JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.\" You can make more \n money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. \n I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this \n money, nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for \n this program. I have already made over 4 MILLION \n DOLLARS! I have retired from the program after sending out \n over 16,000 programs. \n\n Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not \n change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. \n Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone \n you can think of. One of the people you send this to may \n send out 50,000...and your name will be on everyone of \n them! Remember though, the more you send out the more \n potential customers you will reach. \n\n So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, \n materials and opportunity to become financially independent, \n IT IS NOW UP TO YOU! \n  \n\n HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WORKS \n\n HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE \n YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS \n\n INSTRUCTIONS: \n\n This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100 %, \n EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or \n more in the next 90 days. Before you say \"BULL... \", please \n read this program carefully. \n\n This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making \n opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all \n multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting \n new partners and selling our products. Every state in the \n USA allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners, \n and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR \n ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so \n you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in \n your own home, store or office. This is the GREATEST Multi- \n Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: \n\n This is what you MUST do: \n\n 1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell \n them if you don't order them). \n\n * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & \n NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, \n YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & \n RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the \n person whose name appears on the list next to the \n report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS \n ON YOUR ENVELOPE IN CASE OF ANY MAIL \n PROBLEMS! \n\n * When you place your order, make sure you order each \n of the four reports. You will need all four reports so \n that you can save them on your computer and resell \n them. \n\n * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of \n the four reports. Save them on your computer so they \n will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of \n people who will order them from you. \n\n 2. IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people \n who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on \n the list, in any way other than is instructed below in steps \n \"a\" through \"f\" or you will lose out on the majority of your \n profits. Once you understand the way this works, you'll \n also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, \n this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not \n work. \n\n a. Look below for the listing of available reports. \n\n b. After you've ordered the four reports, take this \n letter and remove the name and address under \n REPORT #4. This person has made it through the cycle \n and is no doubt counting their $50,000! \n\n c. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down \n to REPORT #4. \n\n d. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down \n to REPORT #3. \n\n e. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down \n to REPORT #2. \n\n f. Insert your name/address in the REPORT #1 position. \n\n Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! \n\n 3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, \n and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the \n instruction portion of this letter. \n\n 4. Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the \n WORLD WIDE WEB! SEND OUT THIS LETTER (with your name added) \n TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN, EVEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY. \n Advertising on the WEB can be very, very inexpensive, and \n there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another \n avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists. \n You can buy these lists for under $20/20,000 addresses or \n you can pay someone to take care of it for you. BE SURE \n TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY! \n\n 5. For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail \n them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS \n PROVIDE SAME- DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! \n This will help guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out, \n with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt \n because they can't advertise until they receive the report! \n To grow fast be prompt and courteous. \n\n ------------------------------------------ \n AVAILABLE REPORTS \n ------------------------------------------ \n ***Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME*** \n Notes: \n - ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT \n - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA THE QUICKEST \n DELIVERY \n - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least \n two sheets of paper \n - On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the number & \n name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, \n and (c) your postal address. \n ________________________________________________ \n REPORT #1 \"THE INSIDER'S GUIDE TO ADVERTISING FOR FREE ON THE INTERNET \n\" \n\n ORDER REPORT #1 FROM: \nL.

Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on \n your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will \n EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone \n else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline \n members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING \n results below. \n\n 1st level--your 10 members with $5.....................$50 \n\n 2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)........$500 \n\n 3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)...$5,000 \n\n 4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5x10,000).$50,000 \n\n THIS TOTALS ------> $55,550 \n\n Remember, this assumes that the people who \n participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment \n what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Lots \n of people get 100s of participants! THINK ABOUT IT! \n\n Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely \n you can afford $20). You obviously already have an internet \n connection and e-mail is FREE! REPORT #3 shows you the \n most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing \n e-mail lists. Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on \n trade! \n\n Over 50,000, new people, get on the internet EVERYDAY (CBS NEWS)! \n\n *******TIPS FOR SUCCESS******* \n\n * TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, \n professional, and follow the directions accurately. \n\n * Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have \n them when the orders start coming in because: \n\n When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the \n requested product (report) to comply with the U.S. Postal & \n Lottery Laws, Title 18, Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18, \n Section 3005 in the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. \n vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state that \"a product \n or service must be exchanged for money received.\" \n\n * ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE \n ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. \n\n * Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow \n the instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be \n SUCCESSFUL! \n\n * ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW \n YOU WILL SUCCEED! \n\n *******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE******* \n\n Follow these guidelines to help assure your success: \n\n If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within \n two weeks, continue advertising until you do. Then, a \n couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders \n for REPORT #2. If you don't, continue advertising until you \n do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for \n REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is \n already working for you, and the cash can continue to roll in! \n\n THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: \n\n Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are \n placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP \n TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \n people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more \n income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole \n process again! There is no limit to the income you will \n generate from this business! \n\n PLEASE NOTE: If you need help with starting a business, \n registering a business name, learning how income tax is \n handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business \n Administration (a Federal agency) 1-(800)827-5722 for free \n help and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue \n Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars \n about business tax requirements. Your earnings and results \n are highly dependant on your activities and advertising. This \n letter constitutes no guarantees stated nor implied. In the \n event that it is determined that this letter constitutes a \n guarantee of any kind, that guarantee is now void. Any \n testimonials or amounts of earnings listed in this letter may be \n factual or fictitious. If you have any question of the legality of \n this letter contact the Office of Associate Director for \n Marketing Practices Federal Trade Commission Bureau of \n Consumer Protection in Washington DC. \n\n *******T E S T I M O N I A L S******* \n\n This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! \n Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a \n different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of \n potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a \n great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little \n cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the \n program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial \n security. \n\n Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS \n\n My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I \n am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I \n make pretty good money. When I received the program I \n grumbled to Doris about receiving \"junk mail.\" I made fun of \n the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population \n and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Doris \n totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with \n both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay \n the old \"I told you so\" on her when the thing didn't work... \n well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had \n received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had \n received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was \n sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a \n believer now. I have joined Doris in her \"hobby.\" I did have \n seven more years until retirement, but I think of the \"rat race\" \n and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. \n\n Frank T., Bel-Air, MD \n\n I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement \n to you. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first \n orders come in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to \n verify that the plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS! \n\n Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC \n\n The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this \n system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to \n get a large amount of money in a short time. I was \n approached several times before I checked this out. I joined \n just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal \n effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received \n $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. \n Phillip A. Brown, Esq. \n\n Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to \n make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative \n that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that \n there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at \n least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found \n my medium-size post office box crammed with orders! For a \n while, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my \n mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any \n 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this plan is \n that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. people live. There \n simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. \n\n Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI \n\n I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I \n wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had \n no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait \n until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then \n it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 \n on the first try!! \n\n D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN \n\n This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit \n our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off \n the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this \n plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for \n your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. \n Good luck and happy spending! \n\n Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA \n\n ORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND \n GET STARTED ON YOUR ROAD TO \n FINANCIAL FREEDOM! \n\n NOW IS THE TIME ! \n\n DECISIVE ACTION YIELDS \n POWERFUL RESULTS ! \n  \n \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-8946715"}, {"subject": "???????? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ?????? ???? ?????????

Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles.\n\n \n\n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old woman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year\".\n\n \n\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boy's school and picked him up. Little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet.\n\n \n\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. \n\n\n\n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever 15-year-old.\n\n \n\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list.\n\n \n\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work\", the boy continues.\n\n \n\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had got him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\n\n \n\n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter.\n\n \n\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\".\n\n \n\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. \"The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework\". He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.\n\n \n\n\"I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs).\"\n\n \n\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and  investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received.\n\n \n\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, \"Please send me report number XYX\". This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee.\n\n \n\n[This is the end of the media release.

Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show in the investigation of this program, to see if people really can make money with this program. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all there are absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in this program, and if people can follow simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost. \n\n\n\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE IN POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \n\n\n\nTestimonial:\n\n\n\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before with this program, but each time passed it up. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThen you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. You will need all 5 reports to save on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 x 5 reports = $25. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail each of the 5 reports from these five different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000''s of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep in your desk in case something happens to your computer.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step \"1 thru 6\" or you will lose out on a majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we have all tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So DO NOT try to change anything other than what is instructed.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information, which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\n\n\n\nLet's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but let's just say it's only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails, with a 0.2% response, which is only 10 orders for Report #1.  \n\n\n\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000 e-mails with only 0.2% responses with orders.  That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report #2. \n\n\n\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that are 1,000 orders for Report #3. \n\n\n\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails. The 0.2% response to that are 10,000 orders for Report #4.\n\n\n\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50 million e-mails. The 0.2% response to that are 100,000 orders for Report #5.\n\n\n\nYour total income in this example is 1...$50 + 2...$500 + 3...$5,000 + 4...$50,000 + 5...$500,000...grand total + $555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE ALOT OF MONEY!!\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\nREMEMBER FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or 1/2 or even 1/4 of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting.  Believe me many people will do just that, and more!\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\n\n\n\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with method #1 and add method #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot start to advertise until they receive the reports.\n\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\nORDER EACH REPORT BY Its NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) or if sending to Australia $10 in Australian currency, etc. which is the same value as $5 USD, for each report. Checks NOT accepted.  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil.  On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR e-mail address, and YOUR name and postal address.\n\n\n\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW!!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nREPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net \n\nOrder REPORT #1 from:\n\nD.

You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. Follow the Program EXACTLY as instructed. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2, #3, #4 & #5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach.

I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \"junk mail\". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and a few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \"I told you so\" on her when the whole thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me!! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received a total of $ 147,200.00....ALL CASH!! I was shocked! I have joined Jody in her \"hobby\".\n\n\n\nMitchell Wolf Chicago, Illinois\n\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big\".\n\n\n\nDan Sondstrom Alberta, Canada\n\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n\"I had received this program before.

Quite frankly, this seems \n>like a cute and well thought-out idea searching for a problem.\n\nHi Paul,\n\nThere is one possible use-case of which I'm aware.\n\nA group of folks are experimenting with RDF metadata in a project called \nRDFWeb [1].  This is currently a research community project that has \nattracted some wider interest (e.g. [2]).  One of the concerns is the use \nof email addresses in the form of mailto: URLs, used as one way of \nidentifying people, being too much like easy targets for spammers.  The \nidea of using hashed URIs has been surfaced [3] to maintain their \nidentifying properties but protecting the corresponding email address.\n\nI generally agree with the sentiment of the other points you make.  SHA-1 \nseems like a good choice for the hashing function.\n\n...\n\nFurther comments, concerning [5]:\n\n- this registers a new URI scheme, which IIRC requires a standards-track RFC.\n\n- what does this URI actually identify?  The same thing as the hashed URI \nidentifies, or the hashed URI itself.  I think it's the latter, so this \ncould reasonably be presented as a URN namespace [7].  This would call for \nan RFC, but not necessarily standards track.\n\n- I think some attempt at canonicalization may be useful (e.g. per section \n4.3), but I think that appendix A attempts too much, and may result in some \nunreasonable failures (especially changing the file extensions).  When \nusing hashed URIs, I think one should presume that the URI has been \nobtained directly or indirectly from a definitive source before hashing.\n\nIn the use-case of which I'm aware, it is reasonable to assume that the URI \nhas been obtained authoritatively or common variations may be \nstored.  Further, an application is not prevented from trying some simple \nheuristics to obtain a match.\n\n- I'm intrigued what purpose the +frag, +query flags serve.  Also, in \nincluding fragment identifiers as part of the hashed URI, users should be \naware that some uses of URIs require that any fragment be stripped before \nthe URI is used (e.g. for retrieving a web resource; see [6]).  I guess \nsimilar considerations apply to the query part with relation to the \nresource on the target server.  So maybe I do see some point, if only as a \ndiagnostic for mismatches.\n\n- I suggest that the case of alpha values in identifiers be normalized \n(i.e. always a-z or A-Z), or the URI be declared case sensitive, to \nsimplify hash value comparison.  (Er, that is, if identifiers are really \nrequired.  Per Paul's suggestion, this might be deleted.  At least, start \nout with just one.)\n\n#g\n--\n\n[1] http://www.rdfweb.org/\n\n[2] http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html\n\n[3] http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html\n\n[4] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2002Nov/0024.html\n\n[5] http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-feather-hashed-uri-03.txt\n\n[6] http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fragment.html\n\n[7] http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2611.txt\n\n\n\n\n-------------------\nGraham Klyne\n<GK@NineByNine.org>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-9569171"}, {"subject": "Re: Hashed URI", "content": "* Clive D.W.

Many semantic web applications already use\ncanonicalization and hashes internally to provide faster query and\ncomparison of URIs, and I think that the \"one-way\" nature of hashes will\nmake them a popular choice for people who wish to provide metadata\nwithout necessarily revealing their web browsing habits.

We, as holders of \nsensitive positions in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government \nto scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that \nsome of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement which \ncollectively left the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fiftheen Million, five Hundred Thousand US \nDollars) lying in a suspended Account.\n\n However, from our investigations, we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies \nhave since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no longer exist in Nigeria, \nthus providing us with this opportunity, provided that we have a capable partner, to \nexecute a transaction of this nature.\n\n We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank Account to \nbe provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate. This is because as serving Government \nworkers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to operate foreign Account. In our \ninitial attempt to do this, we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$5m (Five \nMillion Dollars) into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our foreign \nassociate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead that the total amount \nbe transferred into the Account before we can share the money.\n\n As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partner to see this \nmatter to its logical conclusion, and until the initial transaction is satisfactorily resolved, \nwe have cancelled further transactions with him. In the light of the foregoing, it is clear \nthat we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistance and \ncooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of agreement when we \nreach the concluding stages of this transaction.\n\n We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for \nservices/assistance rendered in successfully carrying out this project. We trust that you \nappreciate the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on our part, \nbut when a relationship is confidently established and operations commence you will be \nprovided with all relevant information.\n\n I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating to this proposition \nand you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-mail, for further information on \nthe procedures and requirements of this transaction.\n\n In your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can always reach \nyou. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and \nexpediency. \n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMr.Okon Etiebet\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________\nEC Plaza!!!\nThe world's No.1 B2B site, http://www.ecplaza.net\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________\nEC Plaza!!!\nThe world's No.1 B2B site, http://www.ecplaza.net\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-9649385"}, {"subject": "(?? , ??) ???????? ??????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-9659008"}, {"subject": "?????H???", "content": "?????H?????A?????????F???b?Y?W???t???h???A?o???H???????????P???C?p?G?z???]???Y???h???????W?o?A?H?U???g?p?????A?????????U?z?????h???????????????Y?v?G?G?G?_????\n \n?i?????v???p?????j\n \nFrom ???a???????|\nhttp://www.webhospital.org.tw/home/myself/hair1.html\n \n?i?Y???h?j\n \n1.?g?`?~?Y?v?i?????Y???h?A?U?`?~?Y?v?U?e???????Y???h\n2.???????M?B?L???????~?v??\n3.???????Y???h?t?????~?v??  \n4.?????J?o?t?????~?v???A???_?w???????Q?????A?R?~??\n5.?P?@???~?v?????y????\n6.?~?Y?v???n?~???^\n7.?b?~?v???_?w?j?????W?D?U?A?i?W?i?????~?v???????G\n8.???n?C?j???????@???~?v???~?P\n9.?????Y???A???U?P???Y???P?Y???h\n10.???K?H???s???@???v?G???v???A?H?K???o?Y???h\n11.???????v???A?H?????Y?v?]???Y???h?~?v???????`?v??\n12.???M???????V?o?A?i???U?P?????n???Y???h\n13.???????A?]???????????~?u???????{?H?????????@???A?]???Y???h?b?L???????Y??\n14.?????R???A???K???????o???c???Y???h???D \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n?????_???w???????????????z???z???M?Y???h?B?Y???o?????o?A?????M?????A???D???Y???h?x?Z???z???A???????M???Y???A?????i?v???A???M?????A???|?y???v?????????H???P?C\n  \n?D?n????\n???K?u?????????????w?????t?????????B???C???? ???????Y???????E?C\n?????Z???????????q?v?A?????p???v???X?n?????C\n?????????M?C?????????W?K???M???n???M?????G?C\n??Zinc Pyrithione?????h?????A???w???Y???o???????Y???h???x?Z?C \n \n???????k?G?????Y?v???A???A?q???v?W?????????e?{?w?j?????A?????H???n???d1~2?????A?A?H?M???R?b?A?Y?????n?A?i?A?????????@???C\n?f?t???Z?????@?v???A?????v?????[?X???C\n \n?????????GNT$460\n?e?q?G250?@?? \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n?p?s???Z???h?~?v??---12??5?? ???s?W??\n \n?v???????????P?j?T\n \n?s?????????g???A???h???G???N?????F95%?A?????????????w?A?n?????_?K\n \n \n?? ?????f?@?k??54?~??\n???q?????N?|?_???h?w?j?A?H?H???M???A?D?_???D?`?????A?A???B???e???R?~?C?~?????v?????|?????A???B???H???????O?A???????Z?Y?????Y???h???????F?A?q???????@???Y?N???????????x???C\n \n  \n  ?? ?i?????@?k??52?~??\n???????Y???h???D?Z?Y?????A?????????Z???h?~?v???@?g???A?Y???h???F???h?A???o???G?]???n?F?????????????????????A?Y???h?????D?X?G???????o?V???A?u?n?j???????N?????n?????h???G?C \n \n?? ???????@?k??53?~??\n?????`?????|???Y???h???x?Z?A???????????~?X?????A?Y???h???D?????????F?A???h???G???[?A?????????_???L?~?P?u???n???h?A?~???v???@?I?????????A???A?????P?A?u?n?b?v?????????q?????N???X???C \n \n?? ?????z?@?k??62?~?? \n?Y???h?????????O?Z?j???x?Z?A???????u???????|???Y???C???O?????????~?@?g???A?Y???h?N?v???????F?A?B???D?H???M???A???O?H???w?C?????????G?g???A???h?P?M???????G?D?`?n?A?x?Z?????[???Y???h?X?G???S???F?A?P???u???????C \n \n?? ?????? ?k??57?~??\n???????Y???h?x?Z?~?A?Y???]?|???????o?C?}?l?????????~???A?Y???h?x?Z???????h?A???B?v?????X???B?????A???????????P?|?????B?????C???????????g???A???????o???Y?????o???M?n???A?A???O???}?l?I?l?F?@???C\n \n?? ???w?? ?k??58?~?? \n???????v???e???X?o?A?]???Y???h?x?Z?C?????????~?@?g?????h???G?N???????A?P???X?????M?B?????v???A?D?`???M?????A?A???B?R?~?e???A???D?]?H???y?H?A?u?n?@?~?N?????M?\\?h???D?C \n \n?????M?u  0952512924 ?B?p?j\nbabylook@pchome.com.tw\nhttp://www.babylook.mynuskin.com/\nhttp://www.nuskin.com.tw/pc/information/epoch/epoch.htm\n\n\n PC home ?q?l?H?c?A????????: http://www.pchome.com.tw\n PC home Online ?????a?x?G?|?????@?A?x?W???j???J?f????\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-008-9665352"}, {"subject": "Re: Hashed URI", "content": "Paul Hoffman / IMC said:\n>>    draft-feather-hashed-uri-03.txt\n\n> 1) There is absolutely no need to have two different hash algorithms. \n> For this purpose, both are equivalent.

They are still different URIs. If that is your reasoning, you \nshould be hashing what is returned from the URI, not the URI itself.\n\n>  For example, domain names in URLs are usually case-insensitive.\n>Therefore the need to canonicalise the URL.\n\nAppendix A has examples of mapping \".html\" to \".htm\". That is *very* \ndifferent than talking about case-insensitive host name parts.

I know that we have not had any previous communication prior to this but due to the urgent and critical position we have found ourselves at this present time, we have decided to send you this message asking for your kind and humble assistance in carrying out a transaction which though may seem very herculean but infact very simple and straightforward to handle. To intimate you further, I am a top official, and member of the new civilian administration Contract Review Committee on the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) in my country, who are interested in the importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped over here in our apex bank. In order to actualize this dream, we seek your assistance to transfer the said-trapped funds into an interest bearing account which you have absolute control over in your country or a third country other than my country. \n\nThe new civilian administration of General Olusegun Obasanjo (rtd) set-up this committee specifically to review all contracts/projects awarded/executed for the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) to determine their propriety and relevance in the light of the country's current economic and political realities. We have identified a lot of inflated contract funds that are presently floating in our apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). At this moment we have worked out modalities within ourselves, and some acquaintances at the apex bank, to divert the sum of US$29,300,000.00 (twenty-nine million, three hundred thousand United States Dollars) only, for our personal use.  However, by virtue of our positions as Civil Servants and members of the Committee on the PTF, we cannot acquire this money in our names hence our seeking your assistance through this medium. Consequently, I was delegated by my colleagues as a matter of trust to lo!\nok for an overseas partner into whose account we can transfer this sum of money to recieve and safekeep on our behalf.\n\nFurthermore, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total sum into your account for disbursement. Your areas of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction and the account required for this project can either be PERSONAL or COMPANY account which you have total and absolute control over. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 10% of this sum, 85% for us officials, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses between the parties in the course of this transaction. You must however note that this transaction is subject to the following terms and conditions: - \n \n (a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence;\n (b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality;\n (c) That the funds would be transferred to an account where you have absolute control over. \nNote that everything however depends on your response to conditions A to C above. \n \nModalities have been worked out to the highest level for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is RISK FREE. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona-fide beneficiary of the funds in question and with us providing the needed and necessary documents to show that you are entitled to this funds, there will be no stopping the funds being transferred into your nominated account. \n\nOnce more, I want you to understand that having put over 23 years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented.
