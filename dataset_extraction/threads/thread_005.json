It also separates the\n\"transaction management\" function of a checkout (maintaining whatever state\nthe server may need to maintain) from the locking function: (which enforces\naccess conditions on a resource).\n\nOne thing we _could have_ (I'm not advocating this, but some might) is a\nresponse that would let a server tell a client that a lock has been\nassigned as a result of the checkout operation. Servers that enforce\nlocking all the time would then be able to inform clients of the needed\nlock ID. This makes the protocol more complex, but reduces the round trips\nfor a lock/checkout pair.\n\nThose of you who are building servers that enforce this kind of locking\nprobably know more than I do about whether that's a needed tradeoff.\n\n  -- David\n\nDavid Durand              dgd@cs.bu.edu  \\  david@dynamicDiagrams.com\nBoston University Computer Science        \\  Sr. Analyst\nhttp://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/   \\  Dynamic Diagrams\n--------------------------------------------\\  http://www.dynamicDiagrams.com/\nMAPA: mapping for the WWW                    \\\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10023192"}, {"subject": "Re: checkout/checkin/uncheckout vs. lock/unlock", "content": "At 3:39 PM -0400 11/30/98, Chris Kaler wrote:\n>My idea was that if we make them the same method, you remove much of the\n>confusion.

If the\naccess is non-exclusive (anyone else can do a checkout as well), it's not\neven a lock in the sense that it blocks other checkout operations. In fact,\nin that case, it's not very lock-like at all, since no operation is blocked\nby it.\n\nYou didn't actually answer the objections either, but just repeated your\nassertion. Maybe my verbose statement of why it's not a lock will give you\na better handle for arguing your point.\n\nSo I think that the notion is rather confusing. Servers that don't offer\nlocking (are then required to supply \"non-exclusive locks\", and track their\nIDs, when in fact they need no such objects or functions... While I approve\nof complexity in the server more than complexity in the client, it seems to\nme that this makes life harder for clients as well...\n\n>               - Converely, when you \"uncheckout\" a working resource, you\n>delete it.\n>               In what sense have you \"locked\" anything?\n\n>This is another reason why I like the LOCK method.

It always\nseemed reasonable to me that a checkout _might_ create a lock (since that's\nthe way many systems work).

If the\n                access is non-exclusive (anyone else can do a checkout as\nwell), it's not\n                even a lock in the sense that it blocks other checkout\noperations.

Checkout is sufficient to provide notification, etc. It's doubtful\nthat all of the notification and status mechanisms for locks will be\nexactly the same as those for collaboration. Even if the mechanisms are the\nsame, if the operations are combined, you can't implement separate policies\nfor the two situations. And that's clearly more suspect.\n\nTo me the similarities in notification and discovery can't hide the basic\ndisconnect with repect to core functionality: a checkout simply need not\nlock anything (depending on server policy). Given that, it's not\nappropriate to call it a lock, or to overload the locking methods.\n\n  -- David\n\nDavid Durand              dgd@cs.bu.edu  \\  david@dynamicDiagrams.com\nBoston University Computer Science        \\  Sr. Analyst\nhttp://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/   \\  Dynamic Diagrams\n--------------------------------------------\\  http://www.dynamicDiagrams.com/\nMAPA: mapping for the WWW                    \\\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10055067"}, {"subject": "Re: defining a versioned resource to be a \"collection\"", "content": "At 6:24 PM -0400 11/5/98, Chris Kaler wrote:\n>We would also have to add the notion of a \"default\" member to a collection.\n>That is, if I do a GET on the versioned resource, which is just a\n>collection, which resource within the collection do I return (this is the\n>PIN method, but the semantics are a little broader now -- not that this is\n>bad).\n\nAs I understand collections, the result of doing a GET is server defined\n(as we have properties for accessing metadata and contents information for\ncollections).

We must have\nsuch URLs to support version-specific links (e.g. for copy-editing\napplications). So why create a duplicate mechanism involving new HTTP\nheaders that duplicates that functionality.\n\nYou articulate a the case for configurations or some other way of getting a\n\"friendly\" default-version URL space.

I\nstrongly disagree that \"versioned collections\" should be an optional\npart of WebDAV versioning support, since without them, there's no way\nto have a reliable mechanism for accessing previous versions of a Web site.\n\n   I don't think that collections have references is viable.\n\nThat will come as a shock to the advanced collections team (:-).\n\n   First, the client\n   should have to do anything different if it is working on a versioned\n   collection that if it is working on a non-versioned collection.

If you consider the addition of\na \"repository\" resource to the Web site (to hold the versioned\nresources) to be a structure change, then I will argue both that this\nis a very minor and a very necessary restructuring.\n\nNote that the addition of the repository is the only change to the\nuser visible \"structure\".

It draws the design \"line in the sand\" at the right place and\nin the right way\n\nThe discussion that preceded this message about collections with references,\nmutable properties, one method for lock and versioning all point to the\ndifficulty of getting this right.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10071800"}, {"subject": "CHECKIN/CHECKOUT", "content": "Even though we missed the Jan 11 deadline, Jim Amsden and I have been\nhard at work on the WebDAV versioning model, and hope to have some\ndocuments to send out by the end of January (Jim even flew up to\nMass in last week's ice storm for 2 days to work on it with me,\nwhich definitely deserves a \"beyond-the-call-of-duty\" award).\n\nBefore I get my part of those documents finished up, I wanted to send\nout the long-promised \"CHECKOUT/CHECKIN\" document.  This document has\nbeen significantly affected by the results of our modeling efforts, and\nso will probably bear only remote resemblance to what folks remember of\nthe various prior conversations on the subject.\n\nSo with that in mind, here's what I've got:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHECKOUT/CHECKIN\n\n\nPutting a Resource under Version Control\n\nWhen a resource is put under version control, it becomes unwriteable.\nIn order to modify a resource, it must first be checked out, then can\nbe modified one or more times, and then checked back in to indicate\nyou are done modifying it.  If your CHECKOUT fails, it means someone\nelse is currently modifying the document, so you should only do a GET\nwith the understanding that the results are only temporarily valid.\n\n\nCheckout vs. Lock\n\nNote the distinction between a (write) LOCK and CHECKOUT.  The LOCK\ntakes a resource that is writeable by everyone and temporarily makes\nit unwriteable by everyone except the lock holder (until it is\nUNLOCK'ed).  A CHECKOUT takes a resource that is unwriteable by\neveryone, and temporarily makes it writeable (until it is CHECKIN'd).\nIt is reasonable to apply a LOCK to a checked-out resource, but is\nnot required.  In particular, many systems will decide the LOCK\nis irrelevant, since a \"friendly\" client will delay writing until\nit can perform a CHECKOUT, and an \"unfriendly\" client can just wait\nuntil the UNLOCK and then trash the resource contents at will.\n\n\nImmutable-Revisions\n\nAn immutable-revision is a revision whose contents (and immutable\nproperties) cannot be changed.  More precisely, an attempt to retrieve\nthe contents or immutable properties of an immutable-revision will\nalways return the same contents or will fail.  Therefore a server can\ndelete the contents or properties of an immutable-revision (resulting\nin a failure when an attempt is made to retrieve those contents or\nproperties), but can never delete the immutable-revision itself.\n\n\nMutable-Revisions\n\nA mutable-revision is a revision whose contents and properties can be\nchanged, although an attempt to change the contents or the \"immutable\nproperties\" of a mutable-revision must be preceded by an explicit\n\"checkout/thaw\" operation, and then should be followed by a\n\"checkin/freeze\" operation to return it to a read-only state.  This\nthen requires two flavors of checkout: a checkout that unfreezes an\nexisting mutable-revision (which I'll call CHECKOUT) and a checkout\nthat creates a new (unfrozen) mutable-revision that is based on an\nexisting mutable-revision (which I'll call CHECKOUT-NEW).\n\n\nBranching\n\nWhen a versioned resource supports immutable-revisions, it is still\nnecessary to support \"change\".  In particular, there must be some\nresource that you can name, that will periodically take on new values.\nFor a versioned resource with immutable-revisions, this analogue to a\nmutable-revision is called a \"branch\".  Like a mutable-revision, a\nbranch can be checked-out, changed, and then checked-back in.  The tip\nof the branch then reflects this change.  Also as with mutable\nrevisions, you sometimes want to check out a new branch that is based\non (the tip of) an existing branch, which requires another flavor of\ncheckout (i.e. CHECKOUT-NEW).\n\nFrom a protocol perspective, this provides a way to unify the worlds\nof mutable and immtable-revisions.  In each world, there is CHECKOUT,\nCHECKOUT-NEW, and CHECKIN, where CHECKOUT modifies an existing\nmodifiable entitity, while CHECKOUT-NEW creates a new modifiable\nentity that can be modified in parallel with the original entity.\nCHECKIN is used in either case to return the resource to a readonly state.\n\nThe alternative is to provide THAW/FREEZE operations that can only be\napplied to mutable-revisions, resulting in inoperability between\nservers that support mutable-revisions and servers that support\nimmutable-revisions.\n\n\nSpecifying CHECKOUT/CHECKOUT-NEW Policy\n\nFor versioning individual documents, it is sufficient to just let the\nuser select CHECKOUT or CHECKOUT-NEW, as they see fit.  For\nversioning sets of related resources that are being modified in\nparallel by multiple users over the course of multiple sessions, it is\nessential that the server provide a mechanism for the client to store\nits versioning policy in a form that can be queried (and updated) by\nmultiple clients over multiple sessions.  This is especially true when\nthe CHECKOUT choice for a particular resource is dependent on the\ncurrent state of the revision graph for that resource.  I propose that\nthe \"workspace\" resource that stores the version-selection-rules is\nthe appropriate place to store this information, since the modification\nand creation of new revisions must be synchronized with the\nversion-selection-rules, or else newly created revisions might\ndisappear from view as soon as they are checked in.\n\nBottom line: A CHECKOUT, CHECKOUT-NEW, and CHECKIN command, with no\nspecial CHECKOUT/IN headers (which should make Larry happy :-).\n\nNote for Dave: The CHECKIN-NEW would be used to produce the \"anonymous\nnew change-set\" you wanted.\n\nNote for Brad: A workspace property would be used to achieve the\n-force_branch_on_new_version functionality that you wanted.\n\nNote for All: This doesn't discuss UNCHECKOUT.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10107637"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - URNs and Destroying Immutable Resources", "content": "Reviewing early drafts of anything is always difficult.

However the reality is that people will want to destroy even notices\nof the existence of a revision for any number of reasons, some more\nnefarious than others. I suspect it is unrealistic of us to expect the\nprotocol to be able to prevent this.\n\nThere is the additional problem of what to do if the resource is destroyed\nand its HTTP URL gets re-used. Who will return the \"this resource has been\nnuked\" notice? The way the language is current written it would seem that\nonce you assign an HTTP URL to a version of a resource, even if you destroy\nthe resource, you are still required to reserve the HTTP URL so it can\nreturn the \"this resource doesn't exist anymore\" error. I suspect we will\nfind significant opposition to this idea. People tend to get touchy about\ntheir HTTP URL namespaces.\n\nOne alternative is to require that a note be dropped into the version\nhistory specifying that there did once exist a version with a set of\nparticular characteristics but its resource has since been destroyed. I\ndon't think this is a good idea because it means that we need to refer to a\nresource (even one which doesn't currently exist) without the use of a URI.\nThis is likely to muck up the protocol in all sorts of unhappy ways. What we\nneed is a URI which refers to a resource independently of the HTTP URL used\nto actually retrieve the resource.\n\nWhich brings us to URNs. I don't propose we actually use URNs, I don't like\nthem very much. But the underlying concept is sound. We should require that\nall resources have a URI associated with them that meets the same uniqueness\nrequirements we place on lock token URIs. The URIs DO NOT HAVE TO BE\nRESOLVABLE. If they are, bonus points, but it is not necessary for the\nprotocol to work properly.\n\nWhen a resource is created it must be assigned one of these universally\nunique URIs. The URI can then be used with the IF header on any requests to\nan HTTP URL so as to ensure that the request will only succeed if the\nresource is the same resource as the one specified by the URI.\n\nThe history graph is then free to refer to both the URI and any known URLs\nthat the resource is available under.

I thought we killed this back in '97!\n\nIn December of 1996 Andre van der Hoek put forward a post to the list that\nsummarized a proposal he had made previously to the authors\n(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1996OctDec/0199.html). In\nessence it proposed that clients be allowed to tell servers what their\nversioning policy is.\n\nThe issue was investigated, at length, by the working group and the proposal\nwas rejected in its entirety. The reason for the rejection was as follows:\n\n1) Many DM vendors indicated that their users demanded the ability to\nspecify a single versioning policy for their server and would demand that\nall clients that interoperate with their server must use that versioning\npolicy. The key issue wasn't the particular policy the server used so much\nas the ability of the server to absolutely rely upon a particular policy\nalways being used across all its resources. Without this guarantee it became\nimpossible to apply meaningful security policies and to interoperably share\nversioning data across resources since the knowledge needed to understand\nthe information changed based on which client used which policy against\nwhich resource. Matters became especially bad if clients were allowed to\nchange the policy on a resource once the policy had been established.\n\n2) Client vendors indicated that their clients would be written to use a\nparticular versioning policy and would refuse to interoperate with any\nserver which did not implement that policy. The basis of their reasoning was\nthat the UI the client implemented had to be tuned to a particular policy.\nIf the policy could change based on the resource being talked to then the UI\nwould have to change with it. Furthermore, it is hard enough to write a\nclient which supports a single versioning policy. It is next to impossible\nto write, debug, document, and then educate one's users about a client whose\npolicy could change on a resource by resource basis.\n\nAt the same time the WG got an \"in your face\" demonstration of just how bad\nvariable policies could be in terms of code and protocol complexity. After\nAndre's post in Dec '96 there was a WebDAV WG meeting in Irvine in Jan '97.\nAt the time the various DM vendors refused to compromise in how versioning\nworked. Each insisted that versioning must work exactly the way their system\nimplemented it. For example, we couldn't get consensus on an issue as simple\nas \"if you do a check out is there a working draft? If so, is it created on\nthe server or the client?\" So Jim and I presented a protocol that did\neverything everyone wanted. I only think it required three round trips and 8\ndifferent axis's of negotiation. You can see some of the discussion on both\nclient versioning and policies and on the versioning design noted down as\npart of day two in\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eejw/authoring/irvine/minutes.txt. Unfortunately\nthe meeting notes don't do a great job of recording the discussions that\nvarious comments sparked. Those of you who really enjoy pain can check out\nsection 9 of http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/webdav-draft-06.html for\nthe details. Try not to laugh/cry too hard.\n\nBut the point was made, negotiation and variable policies didn't work. While\nI realize that the policies discussed here are not the same as those\ndiscussed in the document I believe the line of reasoning that made us\nreject policies in '97 will lead us to the same conclusion in '99.\n\nEither way, in '97, the WG consensus was that there would be no negotiation\non versioning policy. Neither clients nor servers would be allowed to\ndictate policy. Rather the WG instructed the authors to come up with a\nsingle policy and make that the standard.\n\n> Bottom line: A CHECKOUT, CHECKOUT-NEW, and CHECKIN command, with no\n> special CHECKOUT/IN headers (which should make Larry happy :-).\n\n> Note for Dave: The CHECKIN-NEW would be used to produce the \"anonymous\n> new change-set\" you wanted.\n\n> Note for Brad: A workspace property would be used to achieve the\n> -force_branch_on_new_version functionality that you wanted.\n\n> Note for All: This doesn't discuss UNCHECKOUT.\n\n> Cheers,\n> Geoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10135915"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - URNs and Destroying Immutable Resources", "content": "   From: Yaron Goland <yarong@microsoft.com>\n\n   Then again, speaking from long painful experience, the WebDAV WG's normal\n   review process involves taking the authors out back and beating them\n   senseless.\n\nBetter some bruises than a bad spec ... so bring on the beatings!

I'm confused. I suspect you need\n   to discuss your model a bit. One can infer a lot about the model by reading\n   the rest of the paper but I dislike having to infer, because I tend to infer\n   incorrectly.\n\nI have tried to apply the terms \"readonly/unwriteable\" and \"writeable\"\nconsistently to refer to a temporary state of a resource, and use the\nterm \"mutable\" and \"immutable\" to refer to a permanent state of a\nresource.  So when you put a resource under version control, it\nbecomes unwriteable, but you can apply a method to it (CHECKOUT) to make\nit writeable.  In contrast, a versioned resource is mutable.  In this\nproposal, it is only certain kinds of revisions that are immutable\n(namely, immutable-revisions).\n\n   2) CHECKOUTs can fail for many reasons wholly unrelated to current use. But\n   the statement does lead one to infer that the proposed versioning system can\n   not support multiple simultaneous checkouts. Is this true?\n\nOnly one checkout of a given mutable-revision (branch) of a versioned\nresource, yes.  If you want to check-out an already checked-out mutable-\nrevision (branch), you need to use the CHECKOUT-NEW method, which checks\nout a new mutable-revision (branch) of the versioned resource.\n\nNote: some systems (like ClearCase) support an \"unreserved checkout\".\nIf we want to support this concept (and I'm not advocating that we do),\nthen we would just adjust the definition to say that there can be at most\none \"reserved\" checkout of a mutable-revision (branch).\n\n   > Checkout vs. Lock\n\n   > Note the distinction between a (write) LOCK and CHECKOUT.

The point is that in\nany model which assumes a LOCK/UNLOCK paradigm (whether it is a shared or\nan exclusive lock), an unfriendly client can trash the resource as soon as\nit is unlocked.  If on the other hand, you support just a LOCK paradigm\n(where you do not assume the resource is unlocked when you are done with it),\nthen you are \"limiting the scope of damage\" (which is a good thing), but\nthat is very different from synchronizing updates between multiple (possibly\nconcurrent) authors, which is what CHECKOUT/CHECKIN is all about.\n\n   > Immutable-Revisions\n\n   > An immutable-revision is a revision whose contents (and immutable\n   > properties) cannot be changed.

Therefore a server can\n   > delete the contents or properties of an immutable-revision (resulting\n   > in a failure when an attempt is made to retrieve those contents or\n   > properties), but can never delete the immutable-revision itself.\n\n\n   If I understand your meaning in saying \"never delete the immutable-revision\n   itself\" you are implying that a server could nuke all the state associated\n   with the immutable-revision but not a note specifying that once upon a time\n   such a revision did exist and did hold a certain position in the version\n   tree.\n\nYes.\n\n   However the reality is that people will want to destroy even notices\n   of the existence of a revision for any number of reasons, some more\n   nefarious than others. I suspect it is unrealistic of us to expect the\n   protocol to be able to prevent this.\n\nWhat non-nefarious people want to do is to make old revisions no\nlonger visible, and to conserve space.  The protocol should/must\nsupport both of these operations.  Giving a server (with its own\nunique-id generator) control over some part of the URI space (which is\nfeasible and common in CM systems) takes care of the rest.  The\nprotocol can't prevent the server from doing something different,\nbut to the extent that the server deviates from the protocol, it will\nnot act as a client expects/intends.\n\n   There is the additional problem of what to do if the resource is destroyed\n   and its HTTP URL gets re-used. Who will return the \"this resource has been\n   nuked\" notice? The way the language is current written it would seem that\n   once you assign an HTTP URL to a version of a resource, even if you destroy\n   the resource, you are still required to reserve the HTTP URL so it can\n   return the \"this resource doesn't exist anymore\" error. I suspect we will\n   find significant opposition to this idea. People tend to get touchy about\n   their HTTP URL namespaces.\n\nPeople also get touchy if their CM system lies about the previous state\nof their resources.  To support both perspectives, we support both\nmutable-revisions and immutable-revisions, where the protocol is designed\nso that these two models can interoperate.  So if you don't care about\nreliable resource history, you can just go with a WebDAV server that only\nsupports mutable-revisions.  If you want reliable history, you go with\none that also supports immutable-revisions (in this proposal, the immutable\nrevision protocol is a proper super-set of the mutable revision protocol).\n\n   One alternative is to require that a note be dropped into the version\n   history specifying that there did once exist a version with a set of\n   particular characteristics but its resource has since been destroyed. I\n   don't think this is a good idea because it means that we need to refer to a\n   resource (even one which doesn't currently exist) without the use of a URI.\n   This is likely to muck up the protocol in all sorts of unhappy ways.\n\nThe server might well internally implement it along these lines, but this\nimplementation choice certainly shouldn't be exposed in the protocol.\n\n   What we\n   need is a URI which refers to a resource independently of the HTTP URL used\n   to actually retrieve the resource.\n\nOther than giving control of part of the URL namespace to the versioning system\n(which is what every CM system does), why can't it be a URL?\n\n   Which brings us to URNs. I don't propose we actually use URNs, I don't like\n   them very much. But the underlying concept is sound. We should require that\n   all resources have a URI associated with them that meets the same uniqueness\n   requirements we place on lock token URIs. The URIs DO NOT HAVE TO BE\n   RESOLVABLE. If they are, bonus points, but it is not necessary for the\n   protocol to work properly.\n\nNot good enough.  I need to be able to find this resource, not just detect\nwhether two different URL's refer to it.  It's the resource that tells me\nthe URL's of the other revisions associated with this resource.\n\n   When a resource is created it must be assigned one of these universally\n   unique URIs. The URI can then be used with the IF header on any requests to\n   an HTTP URL so as to ensure that the request will only succeed if the\n   resource is the same resource as the one specified by the URI.\n\nSee above.\n\n   The history graph is then free to refer to both the URI and any known URLs\n   that the resource is available under. If the HTTP URL is changed or the\n   resource is destroyed then the graph will only refer to the universally\n   unique URI. This allows the version to still be refereed to in various\n   operations (such as creating a child) even though it doesn't exist.\n\nThis doesn't give me the reliable history that I require for effective\nconfiguration management.  Over the lifetime of a resource, there will\nbe hundreds of revisions of the resource, most of which are no longer\n\"active\".  But periodically, I need to refer to some of them as\nfull-fledged resources, with their properties and contents accessible\nand intact.  Having them stamped with some URI that gives me no\nability to locate them is of little, if any, value.\n\nThere's a good chance that email doesn't provide the bandwidth we need\nhere, so voice or even visual communication may be required.  The\nsurvivor (if any) then could report back to the mailing list (:-).\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10144315"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - Mutable resources and a call for consensus", "content": "   From: Yaron Goland <yarong@microsoft.com>\n\n   > Mutable-Revisions\n\n   > A mutable-revision is a revision whose contents and properties can be\n   > changed, although an attempt to change the contents or the \"immutable\n   > properties\" of a mutable-revision must be preceded by an explicit\n   > \"checkout/thaw\" operation, and then should be followed by a\n   > \"checkin/freeze\" operation to return it to a read-only state.

If there are importand documents that are stored on a\nmutable-revision server, then you'd like to just use your immutable-revision\nclient just as you always did.  You wouldn't be able to retrieve the\nimmutable-history of the resource, but you can do a CHECKOUT, or if that fails\nbecause some other client already had it checked-out, you can do a\nCHECKOUT-NEW to get a new mutable resource (although you might think\nof it as a branch).

There is a\n\"mutable thing\" that you can ask to see in your workspace, and that is\nupdated when anyone does a \"CHECKIN\" to that mutable thing.

One of the key distinctions is that a branching system\nrequires that at most one child of a revision can be on the same \"branch\"\nas its parent.  So you \"branch\" when you create a child that is not on\nthe same branch as its parent.  Notice that you can branch without creating\na fork.\n\nNow as for a compelling reason for treating a checkout that would result in\na branch differently from one that does not, one of the commonest version\nselection rules is \"branch-LATEST\", i.e. I would like to see the latest\nrevision on a particular branch.  If you checkout/in something on that\nbranch, everyone seeing that branch-LATEST will see your change, while\nif you checkout/in something on some new branch (based on that branch)\nonly people asking to see that new branch-LATEST will see your change.\nNotice the identical behavior of \"branch-LATEST\" and mutable revisions.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10167021"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - Versioning Policies?", "content": "   From: Yaron Goland <yarong@microsoft.com>\n\n   Welcome to the fourth and final entry in my series of comments on Geoffrey's\n   proposal.\n\nAnd my congratulations to Yaron for his detailed comments (and to anyone\nthat has made it this far :-).\n\n   > Specifying CHECKOUT/CHECKOUT-NEW Policy\n\n   > For versioning individual documents, it is sufficient to just let the\n   > user select CHECKOUT or CHECKOUT-NEW, as they see fit.

That approach has some\n   major benefits, not the least of which is that the second user to\n   check-in can be given the option of merging all the changes and\n   thus avoiding the fork altogether.\n\nExcellent question.\n\nFirst the easy part, i.e. for mutable-revisions.  With\nmutable-revisions, a CHECKOUT-NEW has to create a new revision,\nbecause somebody else has checked out the current revision, and if you\nmake changes to it while that person has it checked out, you'd stomp\non that persons changes.\n\nNow for the harder part, i.e. for immutable-revisions.  The key here\nis that the protocol can be kept simple by just treating this as\nsomething you tell the server once, (i.e. a property of your \"workspace\"),\nand then when you perform a CHECKOUT, it looks at this property of your\nworkspace to see whether to do a \"reserved\" CHECKOUT-NEW (i.e. create the\nbranch at checkout time) or an \"unreserved\" CHECKOUT-NEW (i.e. just merge\nback to the original branch on checkin).  One reason why this is better\napproach is that this decision tends to persist between sessions, so if\nwe required it to be explicitly stated on every CHECKOUT, the client\nwould end up storing this information anyway as some property of a\nresource so it can retrieve the value between sessions.  So we might as\nwell standardize this property so that clients can find this property\non any server that supports this notion.  Finally, this has the advantage\nthat it keeps the CHECKOUT protocol identical for mutable and immutable\nrevisions.\n\n   Another alternative model has the fork happening on check-out,\n   but doesn't give either child revision special status until the\n   first one is checked in.  In particular, until a check-in occurs\n   one wouldn't know which child will become the immediate successor\n   on the same branch as their shared parent, and which -- in the\n   absence of a merge -- would be shunted off to a side-branch.\n\n   Either of these alternatives supports a less structured style\n   of cooperative work, without sacrificing any revision-control\n   rigor.\n\nYes, each of these alternatives is reasonable.  For very common alternatives\nlike these, I think we should define in WebDAV the workspace property values\nthat will select them (e.g. DAV:unreserved and DAV:branch-if-necessary).\nI'd like to defer the details of this property until I've posted a\ndescription of a \"workspace\", since that is the resource on which this\nproperty is proposed to live.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10182617"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - URNs and Destroying Immutable Resources", "content": "At 10:46 PM -0500 1/19/99, Yaron Goland wrote:\n>Geoffrey Clemm wrote:\n>> When a resource is put under version control, it becomes unwriteable.\n>> In order to modify a resource, it must first be checked out, then can\n>> be modified one or more times, and then checked back in to indicate\n>> you are done modifying it.

There's\nalso an ambiguity with respect to \"writeable\": a system that preserves\nimmutable _revisions_ a resource is still writeable, but only by creating a\nnew revision, not by modifying an existing revision. For a system that\ndoesn't preserve immutable revisions, this distinction is masked by the\nfact that there's a number of distinct objects (any of which might be\nmutable, depending on whether or not they are frozen).\n\nBy having the same protocol element be used for named branches and \"mutable\nversions,\" we can hide the distinctions between these different kinds of\nsystems in a way that they can interoperate.

Hiding the past\nexistence of a revision is pretty irrelevant: if the server never re-uses\nthe revision ID, the client really can't know _why_ that is the case. If\nthe server has a requirement to perform such hiding, then it's free to hand\nout opaque version names (like MD5 digests, say) -- this leaves a client no\nway to deduce what revisions may or may not have existed in the past, only\nwhat revisions are currently part of the resource's history.\n\n>There is the additional problem of what to do if the resource is destroyed\n>and its HTTP URL gets re-used.

There are a lot of\ndefinitions in the versioning goals draft that may make this discussion\nclearer. For instance, the word \"version\" is undefined, as having too many\nimplications.

It would be very useful to have\nuniversal unique names for all versions of all resources _ever_ -- but it's\nnot required for many useful systems. Where it is required, everything\nproposed so far will work just as well with URNs instead of URLs, except\nthat the use of URNs would solve the uniqueness problem.\n\n>The history graph is then free to refer to both the URI and any known URLs\n>that the resource is available under.

However, we found that in order to\nmake progress, we had to yield and support the more flexible DMS semantics.\n\nOn your second question, this was discussed at length in the Portland WG\nmeeting, and it was generally agreed that the DMS servers didn't want to\nhave a separate protocol, but wanted to share most of the semantics of more\nformal versioning systems, but with the additional freedom to change\nrevisions. Interoperability was a secondary goal, and as you point out,\nclients from both camps could be confused by servers supporting the other\ncamp. This is an unfortunate result of having a lot of options.\n\nThis issue has consumed a lot of the versioning WG's attention and effort,\nperhaps at the cost of reaching consensus in other important areas. I think\nwe should formulate use cases that motivate these various semantic\nalternatives, and look for common agreement. I also think we need to focus\non semantic coverage of versioning, parallel development, and configuration\nmanagement before we introduce semantic variants, options, and\noptimizations. Otherwise we run the risk of including some feature only to\ndiscover it doesn't make sense in the context of other features.\n\nFor example, in systems that support parallel development, when activities\nare merged, the system can generate the conflicts list, and can maintain\nthe list as they are resolved by the author. Having this capability is of\nenormous importance because it helps make sure changes aren't lost. If\nrevisions are allowed to change, then an author cannot rely on the\nconflicts list. New conflicts could be created at any time without any\nrecord. Similarly, changing revisions of resources in a configuration used\nto deploy a web application compromises the ability to re-create a\nparticular distribution. Sure, changing a spelling mistake in a document\nmight not have any significant effect on the configuration, but what about\nchanging an assignment in a script that is part of an HTML page?

Is this something you want to leave up to any author to decide?\nAuthoring web resources is much more than authoring static documents, and\nthe versioning requirements are much stricter.

A versioned resource has two revision histories, the\nsuccessor/predecessor history, and the derived from history. The actual\nsemantics of derived from relationship are not specified by WebDAV as they\nare unpredictable, WebDAV only maintains the relationship.

If the revision is already checked out, then the checkout will\nfail. The author must set the current activity in his workspace to a new\nactivity and checkout the revision in the new, parallel activity.\nMutability is not derived from the checked out resource, nor is it\ndetermined at checkout time (you don't have a revision yet).\n\n6. An author determines whether a revision is mutable or not when the\nrevision is checked in. This establishes the full relationship with the\nrevision that was checked out. If it is checked in as an immutable\nrevision, then the relationship is successor/predecessor. If it is checked\nis as mutable, then the relationship is derived from.\n\nThis lets the author decide on a revision-by-revision, resource-by-resource\nbasis the mutability of a revision.

That is, the server provides both mechanisms, and the client picks\nthe policy it wants. As Yaron pointed out, this approach won't scale to too\nmany different semantic variants, so we should pick them carefully.

It is assumed that DMS\nclients are not as interested in these facilities as mutable revisions\nwould cause unpredictable and unexpected results. Note however that if they\nbecome interested, all they need to do is change a header on checkin to\nmake the revision immutable, and they get all the parallel development and\nconfiguration management semantics from then on, on the same resource and\non the same server.\n\n10.

If an author wants a mutable version, he\ncan checkout the immutable revision, and check it back is as mutable in\norder to create a new, mutable revision. If the resource is already checked\nout, then this would require a new activity.\n\n12. Workspace version selection rules can include mutable and immutable\nrevisions.\n\nSo there is no change in how revisions are accessed. However, a mutable\nrevision cannot be in a configuration, so this limits the version selection\nrules that can be used to specify mutable revisions.\n\n13. Activities can contain mutable revisions, but these activities cannot\nbe the source of a merge.\n\nWe may want to modify the semantics of the conflict list to include\nline-of-descent conflicts of immutable revisions, and an indication of\npotential, undetermined conflicts that could arise at any time due to\nchanges in mutable revisions.

I think the predecessor/successor\nrelationship\n     is still valid, you just can't make immutable guarantees.  This is\n     bad for source control, but can be fine for some DMS systems.\n\n4.

That would imply a branch to me.  Why wouldn't\n     I THAW it, GET it, PUT it, and FREEZE it?  Although technically I\n     don't have a problem with THAW it, check it out, check it in, and\n     FREEZE it, it just seems weird because the checkout is creating a\n     mutable version which the \"THAW\" already did.\n\n6. An author determines whether a revision is mutable or not when the\nrevision is checked in. This establishes the full relationship with the\nrevision that was checked out.

Version\n     3 of the document has a typo and I just want to fix it -- and I declare\n     that it is OK.  The pred/succ relation doesn't change (2 is before 3\nand\n     4 is after 3).  The client can detect that revision 3 was THAWed and\n     see that the modified time is later than 4 and that's OK.  If you\naccept\n     THAW, then the pred/succ is a logical relationship and not guaranteed\nto\n     be a physical one.\n\n8.

Must have had trouble sleeping if this thread got\nyou going.\n\nI think there are a couple of misunderstandings that caused some of your\nconcerns. I'll try to clear them up. You may have to refer back to the\noriginal document for context, but I didn't want to reinclude such a long\nnote. The numbers below correspond to the original note.\n\n1. I don't have any problem with making support for mutable revisions an\noption. I don't want to make support for immutable revisions an additional\noption though. If a server supports DAV versioning, it supports immutable\nrevisions. It may in addition support mutable revisions. I just like to\nlimit the options where ever possible. In the \"pool\" scenario, its the\nmutable header on checkin that would be optional.\n\n\n3. We want predecessor/successor to always have well-defined, consistent\nmeaning that supports richer merging and configuration management\nsemantics. As you pointed out, these semantics cannot be guaranteed unless\nthe participants are immutable. So we want to reserve a relationship that\nhas these semantics and call it predecessor/successor as the conventional\nmeaning of these terms fits nicely. The \"derived from\" relationship is\nincluded to support more flexible semantics and mutable revisions.\n\n5. This is where I think there is some confusion. Given an mutable\nrevision, an author can either change it with PUT or PROPPATCH directly, or\ncheck it out to create a new revision and check it back in. In the first\ncase, there is only one revision, and its state changes. In the second\ncase, there are TWO revisions with the derived from revision having the new\nstate, and the original revision is unchanged. This allows the DMS client\nto choose if it wants a new revision (use checkout), or update the existing\nmutable revision (PUT). So you don't need to checkout a mutable revision to\nchange it. This is orthogonal to the freeze/thaw issue. These methods could\nstill be applied to a mutable revision before it can be changed without\neffecting the semantics of checkin/checkout.\n\nThis is also orthogonal to branching. Since you don't need to checkout a\nmutable revision to change it, then branching isn't an issue. If the\nrevision is immutable, or if it is mutable and the author wants a new\nrevision (not an update of the existing revision), and you want to change a\nnon-tip revision, you'll need to create a new activity (which might be\nimplemented as a branch). Sorry, that sentance reads more complicated than\nit is, but you get the point.\n\n6. I think we are in agreement. I also think mutability is a property of\nthe resource, and its association with predecessors, successors, and\nderivations. This is why I think mutability is established on checkin. When\nyou have a versioned resource checked out, you have a working revision, and\nthe relationship to its predecessor is not fully established. The mutable\nheader on checkin tells the server what relationship to create:\nsuccessor/predecessor, or derived from source/destination. It also\nindicates as a result of the relationship semantics whether the revision is\nmutable or not. Note that this information may be derived from the\nrelationship, and not be an attribute of the revision at all.\n\nAgain, I don't have any problem with servers disallowing mutable revisions.\n\n7. [CK] Since I don't see the checkin changing the immutability, this seems\n     odd to me.  I think we are getting the revision graph manipulation\n     involved where it doesn't belong.  The scenario is simple.  Version\n     3 of the document has a typo and I just want to fix it -- and I\ndeclare\n     that it is OK.  The pred/succ relation doesn't change (2 is before 3\nand\n     4 is after 3).  The client can detect that revision 3 was THAWed and\n     see that the modified time is later than 4 and that's OK.  If you\naccept\n     THAW, then the pred/succ is a logical relationship and not\nguaranteedto\n     be a physical one.\n\nAh, but the predecessor/successor relationship DOES change. The revision\nyou said was the predecessor no longer exists. This might be fine for a\nspelling correction, but it a dangerous and missleading lie for many other\nchanges. Merge control is lost, configurations are no longer reproducable.\nHence the need to separate predecessor/successor relationships from derived\nfrom relationships. Predecessor/successor means more than 2 is before 3 and\n4 is after 3. That's what derived from says. Checkin doesn't change the\nmutability, it establishes it. Mutability can never be changed once\nestablished.\n\n8. You're right, configurations can be used for more than just release\nmanagement. For example, setting the version selection rule in your\nworkspace. However, this is a case where the strongest semantic defines the\nmeaning. If configurations are ever to be useful for release management\n(one of their primary uses), then they cannot ever contain mutable\nrevisions. We could introduce the notion of \"mutable configurations\" that\nchange as a result of updates to revisions in the configuration, but I\nthink this is totally unnecessary. Configurations have real value when\ntheir integrity depends on maintaining the associations between their\nmember revisions. Otherwise, just use a collection.\n\n9. Parallel development can be more trouble than its worth if there isn't\ngood support for merging activities. There are two problems: 1) what needs\nto be merged, and when am I done, and 2) how do I merge a given resource.\nBy retaining the revision history and checking out resources in activities,\nWebDAV can easily support 1). 2) requires resource-specific facilities and\nshould be out of scope for WebDAV. However servers can give the source and\ndestination revisions, as well as their least common ancestor: things that\nare essential to any merge tool.\n\n10. Again, it is not necessary to checkout a mutable revision to change it.\nYou might be confusing these semantics with Geoff's proposal which does use\ncheckout in this manner.\n\nI could be easily convinced to include the freeze/thaw semantics, just\nnever on mutable revisions. They should only be a gesture, and not have any\nsemantic meaning. I just left them out due to my minimalist tendencies.\n\n11. [CK] I think this makes sense for source control systems, but not for\nDMS\n     systems.  I think the FREEZE/THAW we agreed to in Portland is fine\n     and the properties can be used to detect if a revision has been\n     mutable.\n\nDMS systems wouldn't check things is as immutable, so there should never be\na need to thaw an immutable revision. So this doesn't seem like a\nrestriction.\n\n12. These semantics make no assumption about either the protocol, or how\nservers might implement them. I'm trying to stay as far away from those\ndiscussions as possible so we can concentrate on the scenarios we want to\nsupport, and the semantics of supporting them. However, I would assume a\nworkspace is a resource having content, likely expressed in an XML document\nthat would contain the version selection rule and a link to the current\nactivity, also a resource. We don't need to overload the property mechanism\nfor this, they could just be new, DAV defined resource types.\n\nProtocol issues:\n\n1. It is a revision and revision relationship problem, but one that is\nestablished at checkin time. So mutability needs to be specified as part of\ncheckin.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10270075"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - Mutable resources and a call for consensus", "content": ">For example, in systems that support parallel development, when activities\n>are merged, the system can generate the conflicts list, and can maintain\n>the list as they are resolved by the author.

In situations\nwhere there is no clear owner, or perhaps many different owners over the\nlifecycle of the resource, the mainline can be completely reserved by some\nCM administrator and given out through access control mechanisms in a\ncontrolled manner. The danger with these approaches is that they produce a\nlot of parallel activities that require merging, and may result in a\ngreater potential for merge errors. An alternative is to be more proactive\nabout who is doing what changes when, and plan activities to avoid parallel\ndevelopment on the same resources. These are issues that are beyond the\nprotocol or its semantics though as different organizations will want to\nuse the protocol to support many different policies.\n\nThese behaviors could be implemented in a client application, or they could\nbe handled by manual administration and/or development procedures.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10347985"}, {"subject": "Mutable Revisions", "content": "Geoff,\n\nI think I have a way to \"merge\" our two ideas for managing mutability that\ngives up both what we want while keeping the protocol simple. The thing I\nlike about your approach is the semantics of checkout for protecting\nresources is more formal than lock, and provides consistent semantics\nbetween DMS and CM style servers. On the other hand, my approach lets you\nmix mutable and immutable revisions on the same resource which seems\nreasonable. Take a look at the use case I added to the goals document for\nthis. Here's the idea:\n\n1. To make any change to a versioned resource, you must check it out first,\neven if the revision being checked out is mutable.\n\nThis means that you can't PUT or PROPPATCH a mutable revision without\nchecking it out first. This is different than my original proposal, and\neliminates the need for freeze/thaw. Checkout/checkin play that role.\n\n2. At checkout time, you can decide if you want to create a new revision,\nor update the existing revision. This option is only available on mutable\nrevisions. Immutable revisions will always require a new revision.\n\nSo this is the same as your checkout and checkoutNew (I would probably use\na parameter and one method though).\n\n3. At checkin time, you decide if you want your new revision (no matter how\nit was checked out) to be mutable or not.\n\nThis comes from my proposal. If the ancestor is mutable, and you want to\ncheckin immutable, then the predecessor relationship is set to the closest\nimmutable ancestor if any. The was-derived-from relationship is still to\nthe original ancestor, so the is-derived-from and was-derived-from\nrelationships are to two different ancestors. I think this supports all the\nrules required for merging and CM, provides flexibility, preserves checkout\nsemantics on revisons, and is very simple.\n\n4. Servers are free to disallow checkout without creating a new version,\nand to checkin as a mutable revision. Servers that provide both DMS and CM\nsemantics can choose the defaults on checkout (new or not), and checkin\n(mutable or not).\n\nThis is the distinction between DMS and CM servers. DMS servers have the\nextra flexibility, but loose merge reports and configurations on mutable\nrevisions. CM servers trade off the flexibility for the richer semantics\nfor merge and configurations. Clients can either be DMS, CM, or even both\nif desired.\n\nWhat do you think?

This document has\nbeen significantly affected by the results of our modeling efforts, and\nso will probably bear only remote resemblance to what folks remember of\nthe various prior conversations on the subject.\n\nSo with that in mind, here's what I've got:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHECKOUT/CHECKIN\n\n\nPutting a Resource under Version Control\n\nWhen a resource is put under version control, it becomes unwriteable.\nIn order to modify a resource, it must first be checked out, then can\nbe modified one or more times, and then checked back in to indicate\nyou are done modifying it.  If your CHECKOUT fails, it means someone\nelse is currently modifying the document, so you should only do a GET\nwith the understanding that the results are only temporarily valid.\n\n\nCheckout vs. Lock\n\nNote the distinction between a (write) LOCK and CHECKOUT.  The LOCK\ntakes a resource that is writeable by everyone and temporarily makes\nit unwriteable by everyone except the lock holder (until it is\nUNLOCK'ed).  A CHECKOUT takes a resource that is unwriteable by\neveryone, and temporarily makes it writeable (until it is CHECKIN'd).\nIt is reasonable to apply a LOCK to a checked-out resource, but is\nnot required.  In particular, many systems will decide the LOCK\nis irrelevant, since a \"friendly\" client will delay writing until\nit can perform a CHECKOUT, and an \"unfriendly\" client can just wait\nuntil the UNLOCK and then trash the resource contents at will.\n\n<jra>\nBut then CHECKOUT/CHECKIN are really the same as UNLOCK/LOCK where the user\nor server had decided to leave the resource locked by default instead of\nunlocked. I'm not suggesting this semantic should be exploited, just that\nthere is a correspondence.\n</jra>\n\nImmutable-Revisions\n\nAn immutable-revision is a revision whose contents (and immutable\nproperties) cannot be changed.  More precisely, an attempt to retrieve\nthe contents or immutable properties of an immutable-revision will\nalways return the same contents or will fail.  Therefore a server can\ndelete the contents or properties of an immutable-revision (resulting\nin a failure when an attempt is made to retrieve those contents or\nproperties), but can never delete the immutable-revision itself.\n\n\nMutable-Revisions\n\nA mutable-revision is a revision whose contents and properties can be\nchanged, although an attempt to change the contents or the \"immutable\nproperties\" of a mutable-revision must be preceded by an explicit\n\"checkout/thaw\" operation, and then should be followed by a\n\"checkin/freeze\" operation to return it to a read-only state.  This\nthen requires two flavors of checkout: a checkout that unfreezes an\nexisting mutable-revision (which I'll call CHECKOUT) and a checkout\nthat creates a new (unfrozen) mutable-revision that is based on an\nexisting mutable-revision (which I'll call CHECKOUT-NEW).\n\n\nBranching\n\nWhen a versioned resource supports immutable-revisions, it is still\nnecessary to support \"change\".  In particular, there must be some\nresource that you can name, that will periodically take on new values.\nFor a versioned resource with immutable-revisions, this analogue to a\nmutable-revision is called a \"branch\".  Like a mutable-revision, a\nbranch can be checked-out, changed, and then checked-back in.  The tip\nof the branch then reflects this change.  Also as with mutable\nrevisions, you sometimes want to check out a new branch that is based\non (the tip of) an existing branch, which requires another flavor of\ncheckout (i.e. CHECKOUT-NEW).\n\n<jra>\nSo how does this relate to activities where a revision is checked out in\nthe context of an activity? Also, what's the difference between checking\nout a branch, and checking out-new on a revision? It seems confusing that\nwe checkout a branch resource in order to change some other resource. I\ndon't think the analogy above holds. For mutable revisions, checkout just\nmakes it writable in place. Checkout-new creates a new revision in the\ncontext of an activity. Say there is no parallel development. Then all\ncheckout-news are done in the same activity and one gets a single\nline-of-descent. This is what you described as checkout on a branch for\nmutable revisions above.\n\nCreating new activities to support parallel development is likely to be\nsomething DMS vendors will want to do, even though the server can't give\nthem a reliable conflict report. As described above, CHECKOUT-NEW on an\nimmutable revision would be the same as checking out an immutable revision\nin a different activity creating the potential for a merge. This seems very\ndifferent than checkout and create a new revision for mutable revisions.\n</jra>\n\nFrom a protocol perspective, this provides a way to unify the worlds\nof mutable and immtable-revisions.  In each world, there is CHECKOUT,\nCHECKOUT-NEW, and CHECKIN, where CHECKOUT modifies an existing\nmodifiable entitity, while CHECKOUT-NEW creates a new modifiable\nentity that can be modified in parallel with the original entity.\nCHECKIN is used in either case to return the resource to a readonly state.\n\n<jra>\nInteresting, but it doesn't feel like it unifies it all that much. Here's\nthe semantics you described:\n\nMutable revisions:\n  checkout: make it writeable\n  checkout-new: create a writeable copy and set the ancestor/descendent\n        was-derived-from relationship\n  checkin: make it temporarily read-only\n  no support for activities, single line-of-descent\n  no configurations\n\nImmutable revisions:\n  checkout: create a writeable copy and set the predecessor/successor\n         is-derived-from relationship\n  checkout-new: create a branch, a new line-of-descent to support\n         parallel development, and do a checkout on that branch\n  checkin: make it read-only\n  can support multiple activities, multiple lines-of-descent, and merging\n  can support configurations\n\nWhen you list it this way, it doesn't seem so uniform. I think the\nuniformity comes from a consept that is too abstract and won't be of\nsufficient interest to users. Another more significant problem is that\nthere is no way to mix mutable and immutable revision semantics on the same\nresource which I think will inhibit DMS style clients from gradually\nmigrating to CM semantics.\n</jra>\n\nThe alternative is to provide THAW/FREEZE operations that can only be\napplied to mutable-revisions, resulting in inoperability between\nservers that support mutable-revisions and servers that support\nimmutable-revisions.\n\n<jra>\nHere's another alternative whose semantics come from merging our two views:\n\nMutable revisions:\n  checkout: make it writeable\n  checkout-new: create a writeable copy and set the ancestor/descendent\n        was-derived-from relationship. Always done in the context of an\n        activity, even if the server only supports one.\n  checkin: make it temporarily read-only\n  checkin-immutable: make the new revision immutable\n  can support multiple activities, multiple lines-of-descent, but merge\n  conflict report would be advisory only\n\nImmutable revisions:\n  checkout: always fails\n  checkout-new: create a writeable copy and set the predecessor/successor\n        is-derived-from relationship. Always done in the context of an\n        activity, even if the server only supports one.\n  checkin: make it temporarily read-only\n  checkin-immutable: make the new revision immutable\n  can support multiple activities, multiple lines-of-descent, and merge\n  conflict report is reliable\n  configurations can be supported for immutable revisions\n\nThis may not be as uniform in the abstract sense as what you describe\nabove, but it seems more uniform in the concrete. The only difference\nbetween mutable and immutable revisions is the expected errors on checkout\nthat enforce the mutability of the resource. Parallel development is a\ncompletely orthogonal concept in this case. If your server supports\nmultiple activities, you have parallel development. If not, the server\neffectively supports only one activity, and there is no parallel\ndevelopment support.\n\nUsers can decide on mutability on a revision by revision basis. For\nexample, it would be great if during the early stages of development on a\nprogram one could make the revisions mutable. This would eliminate a lot of\nuseless history during the initial development and discovery stages. Not\nonly does this save space, but it simplifies the revision history of the\nresource. Then when the user decides something is stable, he can checkin\nimmutable to permanently save the revision.\n\nI would recommend implementing the protocol with two methods CHECKOUT and\nCHECKIN. CHECKOUT would have a boolean header MakeNewRevision and CHECKIN\nwould have a boolean header MakeMutable. DMS clients would set the\nMakeNewRevision header to false, and the MakeMutable header to true by\ndefault. CM clients would do the opposite. Servers supporting both\nsemantics wouldn't care, but would probably provide the CM default in order\nto support their richer semantics. Servers supporting only DMS or CM\nsemantics, but not both would give Bad Request responses for the methods\nthey can't support.\n\nNext, let's look at client/server interoperability. Of all the possible\ncombinations, the ones in question are DMS client on CM server and CM\nclient on DMS server. In this case, I'm assuming a DMS server does not\nsupport checkin(immutable), and a CM server does not support\ncheckin(mutable). The second case is simple and can be immediately\ndismissed. A CM client cannot expect to get semantics from a server that\ndoesn't support it. This is a up-level compatibility we wouldn't expect.\n\nSo the only interesting case is a DMS client on a CM only server. Given the\nsemantics above, checkout (no new revision), and checkin(mutable) would\nfail so that the DMS client defaults would not work. This may be OK, but it\nisn't ideal. Another alternative would be for CM-only servers to realize\nthey may be getting these requests, and to simulate them with mutiple\nrevisions that the client doesn't see. This can easily be done because the\nserver can distinguish between is-derived-from and was-derived-from\nrelationships, even if the participating revisions are never mutable. So\nthe \"mutable\" revision history can be tracked even though there may be many\nimmutable revisions that are not shown. I think this is the same\nimplementation you described in your solution, except the same resource\ncannot have both a mutable and immutable revision history.\n\nI think this approach provides the flexibility DMS systems want for\nmutability, but retains as much of the richer semantics of CM systems as\ncan be reliably supported. At the same time, the semantics of the methods\nare exactly the same in both cases other than expected error conditions for\nchanging immutable revisions. Finally, DMS clients are free to\nincrementally exploit the richer CM semantics without changing their\ncurrent semantics.\n</jra>\n\nSpecifying CHECKOUT/CHECKOUT-NEW Policy\n\nFor versioning individual documents, it is sufficient to just let the\nuser select CHECKOUT or CHECKOUT-NEW, as they see fit.  For\nversioning sets of related resources that are being modified in\nparallel by multiple users over the course of multiple sessions, it is\nessential that the server provide a mechanism for the client to store\nits versioning policy in a form that can be queried (and updated) by\nmultiple clients over multiple sessions.  This is especially true when\nthe CHECKOUT choice for a particular resource is dependent on the\ncurrent state of the revision graph for that resource.  I propose that\nthe \"workspace\" resource that stores the version-selection-rules is\nthe appropriate place to store this information, since the modification\nand creation of new revisions must be synchronized with the\nversion-selection-rules, or else newly created revisions might\ndisappear from view as soon as they are checked in.\n\nBottom line: A CHECKOUT, CHECKOUT-NEW, and CHECKIN command, with no\nspecial CHECKOUT/IN headers (which should make Larry happy :-).\n\nNote for Dave: The CHECKIN-NEW would be used to produce the \"anonymous\nnew change-set\" you wanted.\n\nNote for Brad: A workspace property would be used to achieve the\n-force_branch_on_new_version functionality that you wanted.\n\nNote for All: This doesn't discuss UNCHECKOUT.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10360757"}, {"subject": "Re: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - Mutable resources and a call for consensus", "content": "Sorry for not replying sooner, got bit by the flu bug...\n\nI'm a little worried about the combinatorics of what you proposed.\n\n1.

The reason for two lists is that there are two relationships,\nis-derived-from, and was-derived-from having different semantics. The\nancestor/descendents for these two relationships may be different. It's not\nenough to know that a revision has been mutated, we also need to know where\nit came from. This is required for useful merge conflict lists. Otherwise\nyou can't know what needs to be merged, and when you're done. The\nprecdecessor/successor roles model the stronger is-derived-from\nrelationship.\n\nFor configurations/parallel development, I think we're even closer. Think\nof a revision as a particular instance of a versioned resource. A\nconfiguration is a particular instance of a select set of revisions. For\nparallel development, we introduce the notion of activity which represents\na set of changes to revisions that are likely taken together. So an\nactivity is like a configuration, except it gives what you have changed or\nare changing in the activity. A configuration is a persistent set of\nrevisions while an activity can change anytime. A revision can be checked\nout in many activities if the server supports parallel development.\n\nA workspace is a resource used to resolve resource URLs. A workspace\ncontains a version selection rule and a current activity. Access to a\nversioned resource is always done in the context of some workspace.\nActivities can be merged, and the differences between configurations can be\ngiven as a list of activities, each activity containing a list of resources\nthat are different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Kaler <ckaler@microsoft.com> on 01/25/99 04:24:38 PM\n\nTo:   Jim Amsden/Raleigh/IBM\ncc:   ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org\nSubject:  RE: CHECKIN/CHECKOUT - Mutable resources and a call for consensus\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry for not replying sooner, got bit by the flu bug...\n\nI'm a little worried about the combinatorics of what you proposed.\n\n1.

Introduction\n\n   In this proposal, WebDAV is extended with two classes of versioning\n   support: document-management and configuration-management.  To\n   maximize interoperability and maximize use of existing protocol\n   functionality, document-management is defined as a proper superset of\n   the WebDAV advanced-collection protocol, and configuration-management\n   is defined as a proper superset of the document-management protocol.\n\n1.1.  Versioning and Locking\n\n   These versioning protocols are designed so that WebDAV locking (class\n   2) support is completely optional.  A lock will have it's usual\n   semantics, but nothing in either of the versioning protocols depends\n   on the presence of locking support.\n\n2.  Document-Management Protocol\n\n   Document-management is the simpler versioning protocol designed to\n   support versioning of largely independent resources.  It allows you\n   to concurrently access and modify distinct mutable-revisions of a\n   resource.\n\n2.1.  Document-Management Resource Types\n\n   Document-management introduces the following additional resource\n   types:\n\n2.1.1.  Versionable-Resource\n\n   A versionable-resource is just a standard resource not yet put under\n   version control.  A null-resource is a versionable resource.\n\n2.1.2.  Versioned-Resource\n\n   A versioned-resource is a resource that collects and controls all the\n   revisions for a resource that has been put under version control.\n\n2.1.3.  Mutable-Revision\n\n   A mutable-revision is a resource that is associated with a\n   versioned-resource, and that can be in either a checked-out\n   (writeable) or checked-in (readonly) state.\n\n2.1.4.  VPortal\n\n   A vportal is a special kind of reference whose DAV:reftarget property\n   is the URL of a versioned-resource.  Reading and writing the body of\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 2]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n   a mutable-revision can only be done through a vportal.\n\n   When a PUT is successfully applied to a vportal, a server MAY make\n   that change visible at other vportals that select that same mutable-\n   revision.  When a CHECKIN is successfully applied to a vportal, the\n   state of the mutable-revision at that vportal MUST be made visible at\n   all other vportals that select that same mutable-revision.\n\n   This allows the server to cache the PUT information at the vportal,\n   and only force the update when the CHECKIN is performed.  A vportal\n   otherwise has all the properties and behavior of a normal reference.\n\n   [GMC: I would prefer to simplify the spec by requiring that the\n   change is NEVER visible at another vportal until the CHECKIN is\n   applied, but I was concerned that some would not find this\n   acceptable].\n\n2.2.  Document Management Properties\n\n   Document-management introduces the following additional properties:\n\n2.2.1.  Versioned-Resource Properties\n\n   Document-management introduces the following additional properties\n   for a versioned-resource:\n\n2.2.1.1.  DAV:mutable-revisions (readonly collection)\n\n   The DAV:mutable-revisions collection of a versioned-resource contains\n   all mutable-revisions of that versioned-resource, where the name of a\n   mutable-revision in the DAV:mutable-revisions collection is its\n   DAV:mutable-revision-id.  PROPFIND can then be used to gather\n   arbitrary information about the mutable-revisions.\n\n2.2.1.2.  DAV:mutable-revision-labels (writeable collection)\n\n   The DAV:mutable-revision-labels collection of a versioned-resource\n   contains references to members of the DAV:mutable-revisions\n   collection of that versioned-resource.  The client can add and delete\n   members of the DAV:mutable-revision-labels collection.  No member of\n   this collection can have the same name as a member of the\n   DAV:mutable-revisions collection.\n\n2.2.2.  Mutable-Revision Properties\n\n   Document-management introduces the following additional properties\n   for a mutable-revision:\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 3]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n2.2.2.1.  DAV:mutable-revision-id (readonly, immutable)\n\n   The DAV:mutable-revision-id is an identifier assigned to a mutable-\n   revision by the server.  At most one mutable-revision of a given\n   versioned-resource will have a particular identifier.\n\n2.2.2.2.  DAV:reservation (readonly, immutable)\n\n   When the DAV:reservation property of a mutable-revision is set, the\n   mutable-revision is in a checked-out writeable state.  If the\n   DAV:reservation is not set, the mutable-revision is in a checked-in\n   readonly state.\n\n2.2.2.3.  DAV:predecessor (readonly, immutable)\n\n   The DAV:predecessor property of a mutable-revision indicates the\n   mutable-revision that was selected by the vportal immediately prior\n   to the CHECKOUT-NEW request that created this mutable-revision.  The\n   DAV:predecessor property is null for the initial mutable-revision\n   created by a CONTROL request.\n\n2.2.2.4.  DAV:successors (readonly collection, mutable)\n\n   The DAV:successors collection of a mutable-revision contains\n   references to each mutable-revisions whose DAV:predecessor property\n   specifies this mutable-revision.\n\n2.2.2.5.  DAV:auto-check-in-out (writeable, immutable)\n\n   When the DAV:auto-check-in-out property of a mutable-revision is set,\n   an HTTP-1.1 PUT request to a vportal selecting this mutable-revision\n   is automatically preceded by an automatic CHECKOUT and followed by an\n   automatic CHECKIN.  This allows a downlevel client to modify a\n   version-controlled resource if it is not currently checked-out.\n\n2.2.3.  VPortal Properties\n\n   Document-management introduces the following additional properties\n   for a vportal:\n\n2.2.3.1.  DAV:mutable-revision-name (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:mutable-revision-name property of a vportal contains the name\n   of a member of either the DAV:mutable-revisions or DAV:mutable-\n   revision-labels collections of the versioned-resource referenced by\n   that vportal.  This is the mutable-revision that this vportal will\n   select unless an explicit Mutable-Revision-Name header is specified.\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 4]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n2.3.  Document-Management Methods\n\n   Document-management introduces the following additional methods:\n\n2.3.1.  CONTROL\n\n   A CONTROL request can be applied to a versionable-resource.  When a\n   CONTROL request is applied to a versionable-resource, a new\n   versioned-resource is created (at a server-assigned URL), an initial\n   checked-out mutable-revision for that versioned-resource is created\n   (again, at a server-assigned URL), the versionable resource is copied\n   to the new mutable-revision, and then the versionable-resource is\n   replaced with a vportal that refers to the new versioned-resource and\n   whose DAV:mutable-revision-name property is set to be the name of the\n   initial mutable-revision.  When the versionable-resource is a null-\n   resource, the body of the initial-revision is empty.\n\n   A CONTROL request replaces the original versionable-resource with a\n   vportal to ensure that the entire versioned-resource is not deleted\n   when a DELETE or MOVE is applied to the original URL of the\n   versionable-resource.  This ensures that other vportals to that\n   versioned-resource (for example, ones that select different mutable-\n   revisions) continue to be valid, and that even when all vportals to\n   that versioned-resource have been deleted, the versioned-resource and\n   its revisions are retained for historical access.  If the client\n   really wants to delete that versioned-resource and all its mutable-\n   revisions, DELETE can be applied to the URL of the versioned-resource\n   itself.\n\n2.3.2.  MKVPORTAL\n\n   A MKVPORTAL request is used by the client to create a new vportal to\n   an existing versioned-resource.  A client can modify the\n   DAV:mutable-revision-name property of the vportal to cause it to\n   select a different mutable-revision of that versioned-resource.\n   [GMC: MKVPORTAL could just be an optional header to CONTROL, if we\n   wanted to minimize the number of new methods.]\n\n2.3.3.  CHECKIN\n\n   When a CHECKIN request is applied to a vportal, the mutable-revision\n   selected by that vportal is made readonly if it is currently\n   checked-out.  A CHECKIN request will fail if the mutable-revision is\n   already checked-in.\n\n2.3.4.  CHECKOUT\n\n   When a CHECKOUT request is applied to a vportal, the mutable-revision\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 5]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n   selected by that vportal is made writeable if it is currently\n   checked-in.  A CHECKOUT request will fail if the mutable-revision is\n   already checked-out.\n\n2.3.5.  CHECKOUT-NEW\n\n   When a CHECKOUT-NEW request is applied to a vportal, rather than\n   checking out the mutable-revision selected by that vportal, a new\n   mutable-revision for that versioned-resource is created, and the\n   DAV:mutable-revision-name property of the vportal is modified to\n   contain the name of the new mutable-revision.  The new mutable-\n   revision is created in a checked-out state and is therefore writeable\n   until it is subsequently checked-in.\n\n   The creation of a new mutable-revision of a versioned-resource has no\n   effect on vportals that select other mutable-revisions of that\n   versioned-resource.  Similarly, the checked-in or checked-out state\n   of one mutable-revision is independent of the checked-in or checked-\n   out state of any other mutable-revision.\n\n2.4.  Document-Management Headers\n\n   Document management introduces the following additional headers:\n\n2.4.1.  Mutable-Revision-Name\n\n   The Mutable-Revision-Name header is used to override the name\n   specified in the DAV:mutable-revision-name property of a vportal.\n\n3.  Configuration-Management Protocol\n\n   Configuration management is a more comprehensive versioning protocol,\n   designed to support consistent versioning of sets of related\n   resources being modified in parallel by many authors at different\n   sites.  The set of resources will commonly be a subtree of the URL\n   space at a web site, an entire web site, or a set of subtrees at\n   several web sites.  The resources are related by the use of both\n   relative and absolute URL references.  To provide a stable\n   environment for authoring and change control, controlled sharing\n   between distinct workspaces is supported, in addition to the\n   branching and merging support required for reliable parallel\n   authoring.  In order to maintain the validity of inter-resource\n   references, versioning the URL namespace (via versioned collections)\n   is as important as versioning the individual documents.\n\n3.1.  Configuration-Management Resource Types\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional resource\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 6]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n   types:\n\n3.1.1.  Working-Resource\n\n   A working-resource of a versioned-resource is a writeable resource\n   that is created by CHECKOUT or CONTROL.  On a configuration-\n   management server, a checked-out mutable-revision of a versioned-\n   resource is just a reference to a working-resource of that\n   versioned-resource.\n\n3.1.2.  Immutable-Revision\n\n   An immutable-revision of a versioned-resource is a resource created\n   by applying a CHECKIN request to a working-resource.  The body and\n   immutable properties of an immutable-revision cannot be modified.  On\n   a configuration-management server, a checked-in mutable-revision of a\n   versioned-resource will always be a reference to an immutable-\n   revision of that versioned-resource, and the \"CHECKIN history\" of a\n   mutable-revision is captured by a sequence of immutable-revisions.\n\n3.1.3.  Versioned-Collection\n\n   A versioned-collection is a collection that has been placed under\n   version-control.  Versioned-collections are an essential component of\n   configuration-management, because they provide the mechanism for\n   controlling the URL namespace of a set of related resources.  A\n   collection can be placed under version control only if every member\n   of that collections is also under version control, therefore every\n   member of a revision of a versioned-collection is either a vportal or\n   a reference to a vportal.\n\n3.1.4.  Configuration\n\n   A configuration of a versioned-collection provides an immutable\n   snapshot of a URL tree of resources rooted at that versioned-\n   collection.  To be precise, a configuration of a versioned-collection\n   selects an immutable-revision of that versioned-collection, and\n   selects an immutable-revision of every immediate member of any\n   versioned-collection revision in the configuration.  Therefore, a\n   configuration of the root collection of a web site specifies a\n   specific state of the web-site as a whole.\n\n3.1.5.  Activity\n\n   An activity is a resource that represents a single logical change\n   that may involve modifications to several versioned-resources.  The\n   activity collects all immutable-revisions that are created in the\n   process of performing that logical change.  An activity is like a\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 7]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n   mutable-revision label, in that it allows you to give a meaningful\n   name to a particular line of descent, but instead of naming a line of\n   descent in just a single versioned-resource, an activity names\n   related lines of descent in a set of versioned-resources.\n\n3.1.6.  Workspace\n\n   Finally, a workspace is a resource that describes how version\n   selection is to be done across an entire web site.  When a\n   versioned-resource is checked out, it is always checked out into a\n   specific workspace.  Thus a workspace serves the same purpose for a\n   web site as a whole, as a single working-resource does for a single\n   versioned-resource.  The root collection of a web site has a property\n   indicating the default workspace for that web site.  A Workspace\n   header can be used to select a non-default workspace for a request.\n   In addition, a workspace can be specified as the DAV:workspace\n   property of a vportal to make that the default workspace of the\n   vportal.\n\n3.2.  Configuration-Management Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties:\n\n3.2.1.  Root-Collection Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for the root collection of a Web site:\n\n3.2.1.1.  DAV:default-workspace (readonly)\n\n   The DAV:default-workspace property specifies which workspace will be\n   used for a request that does contain an explicit Version-Control\n   header.  If a vportal has no explicit DAV:workspace property, the\n   default workspace of the web site will be used.\n\n3.2.1.2.  DAV:activities (writeable collection)\n\n   The DAV:activities collection of the root collection of a Web site\n   contains the activities created at that Web site.\n\n3.2.1.3.  DAV:workspaces (writeable collection)\n\n   The DAV:workspaces collection of the root collection of a Web site\n   contains the workspaces created at that Web site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 8]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n3.2.2.  Versioned-Resource Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for a versioned-resource:\n\n3.2.2.1.  DAV:immutable-revisions (readonly collection)\n\n   The DAV:immutable-revisions collection of a versioned-resource\n   contains all the immutable-revisions of that versioned-resource.  The\n   name of an immutable-revision in this collection is assigned by the\n   server.\n\n3.2.2.2.  DAV:working-resources (readonly collection)\n\n   The DAV:working-resources collection of a versioned-resource contains\n   all working-resources of that versioned-resource.\n\n3.2.3.  Immutable-Revision Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for an immutable-revision:\n\n3.2.3.1.  DAV:immutable-revision-id (readonly, immutable)\n\n   The DAV:immutable-revision-id is an identifier assigned to an\n   immutable-revision by the server.  At most one immutable-revision of\n   a given versioned-resource will have a particular immutable-revision\n   identifier.\n\n3.2.3.2.  DAV:immutable-predecessor (readonly, immutable)\n\n   The DAV:immutable-predecessor is the immutable-revision that was\n   checked-out to produce a working resource that was checked-in to\n   produce this immutable-revision.\n\n3.2.3.3.  DAV:immutable-successors (readonly collection, mutable)\n\n   The DAV:immutable-successors collection of an immutable-revision\n   contains a reference to each immutable-revision whose DAV:predecessor\n   is that immutable-revision.\n\n3.2.3.4.  DAV:merge-predecessors (writeable collection, mutable)\n\n   The DAV:merge-predecessors collection of an immutable-revision\n   contains references to the other immutable-revisions whose contents\n   were explicitly merged by the client into that immutable-revision.\n   The client is free to add or delete members to this collection in\n   order to more accurately reflect the contents of that immutable-\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                                [Page 9]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n   revision.\n\n3.2.3.5.  DAV:merge-successors (writeable collection, mutable)\n\n   The DAV:merge-successors collection of an immutable-revision contains\n   a reference to each immutable-revision whose DAV:merge-predecessors\n   collection contains a reference to that immutable-revision.\n\n3.2.3.6.  DAV:reservation (readonly, mutable)\n\n   The DAV:reservation property of an immutable-revision contains the\n   URL of a working-resource.  When an immutable-revision is checked-\n   out, the DAV:reservation property is set to be the working-resource\n   resulting from the checkout.  When a working-resource is checked-in,\n   the DAV:reservation of the DAV:immutable-predecessor of the working-\n   resource is removed.\n\n3.2.4.  Working-Resource Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for a working-resource:\n\n3.2.4.1.  DAV:immutable-predecessor (readonly)\n\n   The DAV:immutable-predecessor of a working-resource is the\n   immutable-revision that was checked-out to produce that working-\n   resource.\n\n3.2.4.2.  DAV:merge-predecessors (writeable collection)\n\n   The DAV:merge-predecessors collection of a working-resource contains\n   references to the immutable-revisions whose contents were explicitly\n   merged by the client into that working-resource.  The client is free\n   to add or delete members to this collection in order to more\n   accurately reflect the contents of that working-resource.\n\n3.2.4.3.  DAV:workspace (readonly)\n\n   The DAV:workspace property of a working-resource contains the URL of\n   the current workspace when the working-resource was created by a\n   checkout request.\n\n3.2.4.4.  DAV:activity (readonly)\n\n   The DAV:activity property contains the DAV:activity value of the\n   workspace into which the working-resource was checked out.\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                               [Page 10]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n3.2.5.  Workspace Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for a workspace:\n\n3.2.5.1.  DAV:revision-selection-rule (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:revision-selection-rule of a workspace contains an XML\n   document that describes how immutable-revision selection will be\n   performed in that workspace.  There will be standard elements for\n   specifying common selection mechanisms such as by activity or by\n   label, but additional revision-selection-rule elements may be\n   supported by a WebDAV server.\n\n3.2.5.2.  DAV:merge-selection-rule (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:merge-selection-rule of a workspace contains an XML document\n   that describes what immutable-revisions should be merged into that\n   workspace.  The affect of the merge can be determined by a GET-\n   CONFLICTS request to the workspace, and the merge itself can be\n   performed by an UPDATE request.  There will be standard elements for\n   specifying common merge selection mechanisms such as by activity or\n   by configuration, but additional merge-selection-rule elements may be\n   supported by a WebDAV server.\n\n3.2.5.3.  DAV:auto-descendent-merge (writeable)\n\n   When the DAV:auto-descendent-merge property of a workspace is set,\n   and the merge-from immutable-revision (selected by the merge-\n   selection-rule) is a descendent of the merge-to immutable-revision\n   (selected by the revision-selection rule), the server performs the\n   merge automatically when the workspace receives an UPDATE request.\n   In particular, it checks out the merge-to immutable-revision, copies\n   the merge-from immutable-revision to the new working-resource, adds\n   the merge-from immutable-revision to the DAV:merge-predecessors of\n   the working-resource, and checks in the working-resource.\n\n3.2.5.4.  DAV:activity (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:activity property of a workspace contains the activity that\n   captures the work currently being peformed in that workspace.  The\n   immutable-revisions selected by that activity take priority over the\n   immutable-revisions selected by the revision-selection-rule.  The\n   working-resources checked-out into a workspace take priority over\n   immutable-revisions selected by either the revision-selection-rule or\n   by the workspace activity.  Thus the version selection algorithm for\n   a workspace is \"checked-out to that workspace\" else \"a product of the\n   workpace activity\" else \"selected by the workspace revision-selection\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                               [Page 11]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n   rule\".\n\n3.2.5.5.  DAV:dynamic (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:dynamic property indicates whether version selection for a\n   workspace is computed dynamically, or whether it is computed only\n   following an explicit UPDATE request on that workspace.\n\n3.2.5.6.  DAV:client-workspace (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:client-workspace property indicates whether the working-\n   resources for the workspace should be stored on the server or on the\n   client.  If it is on the client, the DAV:client-workspace property\n   contains a string that indicates \"where\" on the client the root-\n   collection of the workspace can be found.  This string MAY take the\n   form of a URL.\n\n3.2.5.7.  DAV:client-updates (readonly)\n\n   The DAV:client-updates property contains an XML document that lists\n   the immutable-revisions that were selected by the workspace when the\n   most recent UPDATE on that workspace was performed, but that were not\n   selected by the workspace when the UPDATE immediately preceding that\n   UPDATE had been performed.  This list can be used by the client to\n   efficiently maintain a client snapshot of that workspace.  The\n   DAV:client-updates property exists only when the DAV:client-workspace\n   property is set.\n\n3.2.6.  Activity Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for an activity:\n\n3.2.6.1.  DAV:immutable-revisions (readonly collection)\n\n   The DAV:immutable-revisions collection of an activity contains\n   references to all immutable-revisions (in any versioned-resource)\n   whose DAV:activity property contains this activity.\n\n3.2.6.2.  DAV:branch-policy (writeable):\n\n   The DAV:branch-policy contains an XML document that is used by\n   branch-based configuration-management servers to guide the placement\n   of immutable-revisions on branches.  Some of the pre-defined values\n   XML elements that can appear in this document are:  DAV:branch-on-\n   first-checkout, DAV:merge-on-checkin, and DAV:allow-branch-on-\n   checkin.\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                               [Page 12]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n3.2.6.3.  DAV:workspace (writeable)\n\n   The DAV:workspace property of an activity indicates the workspace\n   which is currently working on that activity (and therefore has the\n   right to extend the DAV:immutable-revisions collection of that\n   activity).  If any working-resource has its DAV:activity set to a\n   given activity, the DAV:workspace of that activity can only be set to\n   be the value of the DAV:workspace property of that working-resource.\n\n3.2.7.  Versioned-Collection Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for a versioned-collection:\n\n3.2.7.1.  DAV:configurations (readonly)\n\n   The DAV:configurations of a versioned-collection is a versioned-\n   resource, each of whose immutable-revisions is a configuration.  New\n   immutable-revisions of a DAV:configurations versioned-resource are\n   created by a MAKE-CONFIGURATION request (not by CHECKOUT/CHECKIN).\n\n3.2.8.  Collection Properties\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional\n   properties for a collection immutable-revision or a collection\n   working-resource:\n\n3.2.8.1.  DAV:is-sub-configuration (writeable, immutable)\n\n   In order to increase the efficiency of the creation of a new\n   configuration for a versioned-collection, a new configuration can be\n   composed from sub-configurations, i.e. configurations of versioned-\n   collections that are members of that versioned-collection.  The\n   DAV:is-sub-configuration property tells the server whether to select\n   (or create, if necessary) a sub-configuration for this versioned-\n   collection.\n\n3.3.  Configuration-Management Headers\n\n   Configuration-management introduces the following additional headers:\n\n3.3.1.  Workspace\n\n   The Workspace header specifies the workspace whose version selection\n   rules should be used when dereferencing a reference to a versioned-\n   resource.  If no Workspace header is specified, the workspace\n   specified by the DAV:default-workspace property of the root\n   collection is used.\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                               [Page 13]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n3.4.  Configuration-Management Effect on Existing Methods\n\n   When invoked on a configuration-management server, the following\n   methods will display additional behavior.\n\n3.4.1.  CONTROL\n\n   A CONTROL request creates a new immutable-revision with an empty\n   body, and creates a new working-resource which is a copy of the\n   versionable-resource being put under version-control.  The initial\n   mutable-revision is a reference to this working-resource.\n\n3.4.2.  CHECKIN\n\n   When a CHECKIN request is applied to a vportal that selects a\n   working-resource, it creates a new immutable-revision that is a copy\n   of the working-resource (including its properties), updates the\n   DAV:immutable-successors collection of the predecessor to contain\n   this new immutable-revision, removes the DAV:reservation property of\n   the predecessor, and deletes the working-resource.  The mutable-\n   revision reference is changed to refer to this immutable-revision.  A\n   CHECKIN request fails if it is applied to a vportal that selects an\n   immutable-revision, or if a new immutable-revision cannot be created\n   as a descendent of the DAV:immutable-predecessor of the working-\n   resource.\n\n3.4.3.  CHECKOUT\n\n   When a CHECKOUT request is applied to a vportal that selects an\n   immutable-revision, it creates a new working-resource that is a copy\n   of the immutable-revision.  The DAV:workspace property of the\n   working-resource is set to be the current workspace, and the\n   DAV:activity property of the working-resource is set to be the\n   DAV:activity of the current workspace.  The CHECKOUT request fails if\n   the workspace DAV:activity is not set.\n\n3.4.4.  CHECKOUT-NEW\n\n   A CHECKOUT-NEW request acts like a CHECKOUT request, except that it\n   first creates a new activity, and sets the DAV:activity of the\n   current workspace to be that activity.  A server may reject a\n   CHECKOUT-NEW request if the workspace DAV:activity property is\n   already set.\n\n3.5.  Configuration-Management Methods\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                               [Page 14]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n3.5.1.  Activity and Workspace Creation Methods\n\n   Activity and workspace resources can only be created as members of\n   the DAV:activities and DAV:workspaces collections.  [GMC: We could\n   have a special MKACTIVITY and MKWORKSPACE methods, or we could just\n   allow PUT to create them, with the body of the PUT being an XML\n   document describing how the resource is to be initialized.  I\n   personally find the PUT method cleaner and more extensible because\n   you don't need to add a new method to the protocol to handle a new\n   resource type.  There does seems to be some preference in the mailing\n   group for separate object creation methods, and the use of headers to\n   provide initial values.  I'll defer these details for now.]\n\n3.5.2.  UNCHECKOUT\n\n   When applied to a vportal that selects a working-resource, an\n   UNCHECKOUT request deletes the working-resource and the\n   DAV:reservation property of the predecessor of the working-resource.\n   The mutable-revision is changed to refer to the predecessor of the\n   working-resource.\n\n3.5.3.  GET-CONFLICTS\n\n   When a GET-CONFLICTS request is invoked on a workspace, the body of\n   the GET-CONFLICTS response contains an XML document that describes\n   what versioned-resources are in conflict (commonly, a merge\n   conflict), as well as information about how to resolve the conflict\n   (such as the merge contributors and the merge base).  Merge conflicts\n   are determined by the server by comparing the revisions selected by\n   the workspace DAV:merge-selection-rule against the revisions selected\n   by the DAV:revision-selection-rule at the time of the last UPDATE\n   request (or the current time, if DAV:dynamic-selection is set).\n\n3.5.4.  MAKE-CONFIGURATION\n\n   When a MAKE-CONFIGURATION request is invoked on a versioned-\n   collection, a new configuration is created that contains the\n   revisions currently selected by the workspace for that versioned-\n   collection and all its members.\n\n3.5.5.  Security Considerations\n\n   TBD\n\n3.5.6.  Internationalization Considerations\n\n   TBD\n\n\n\n\ndraft-clemm-webdav-versioning-00                               [Page 15]\n\nINTERNET-DRAFT      Versioning Extensions to WebDAV     January 26, 1999\n\n\n3.5.7.

We were able to work\nthrough most of the issues in the full \"configuration management\"\nversioning models, but we got stuck on one key aspect of the simpler\n\"document management\" subset of the versioning model.\n\nIn particular, Jim proposed a model that was more consistent with the\nconfiguration management model, while I proposed a model that I felt\nwas closer to current document management systems.  Since Jim's\nproposal produces a simpler and more consistent protocol, I'd prefer\nto use his model, but I need to confirm that it is one that is\nacceptable to document management system vendors and users.\n\nThe key questions are:\n- How does a user request that a specific revision of a versioned-resource\n  appear at a specific URL?\n- What revisions can be \"checked-out\" for modification?\n\nThe answers in our configuration management versioning model are simple:\n- The user can associate versioned-resources with URL's in a \"workspace\",\n  and then specifies a \"revision-selection-rule\" for that workspace\n  (i.e. pick all revisions labeled \"LATEST\")\n- The user can check-out any revision that appears in a workspace.\n\nJim's proposal is that we answer these questions the same way in the\ndocument management versioning model.\n\nThis has three key effects on the document-management versioning model:\n\n(1) The concept of a \"workspace\" is introduced at the document-management\nversioning level.\n\n(2) The version-selection rule is a property of the workspace, so if that\nrule says to do something special for URL-1 (e.g. \"for URL-1, pick the\nrevision with id R1.3.5\"), and you MOVE URL-1 to URL-2, you need to\nupdate the version-selection-rule to do this special thing to URL-2\ninstead of URL-1.  In configuration management, this is not a problem\nbecause version selection is almost always done with a floating label\nor \"branch/LATEST\", rather than a bunch of special cases for individual\nresources.

Clemm\" <gclemm@tantalum.atria.com>\ncc:\nSubject:  Re: Discussion Topic: Simple Version Selection and Checkout\n      (Document link not converted)\n\nSome brief clarifications. Here's Geoff's results of using CM style URL\nresolution for DMS systems:\n\n(1) The concept of a \"workspace\" is introduced at the document-management\nversioning level.\n\n(2) The version-selection rule is a property of the workspace, so if that\nrule says to do something special for URL-1 (e.g. \"for URL-1, pick the\nrevision with id R1.3.5\"), and you MOVE URL-1 to URL-2, you need to\nupdate the version-selection-rule to do this special thing to URL-2\ninstead of URL-1.  In configuration management, this is not a problem\nbecause version selection is almost always done with a floating label\nor \"branch/LATEST\", rather than a bunch of special cases for individual\nresources.  Is it a problem for document-management?\n\n(3) Although you can access an arbitrary revision (since every revision\nhas a URL), only a revision exposed in a workspace can be modified.\nThis seems like a pretty reasonable constraint to me, but I wanted to\nmake sure that wasn't just my configuration management background\ncoming through.\n\nFirst, once multiple versions are introduced, there must be some way for\nusers to refer to a particular revision of a resource. We introduced labels\nto provide human meaningful names for particular revisions, and\nconfigurations for refering to sets of particular revisions. But, we need\nsome way of using these labels and configurations to access the revision\nthey name. We also need a deterministic, controlled way of resolving\nreferences to versioned resources that don't specify a particular label.\nWe've explored a number of approaches, none of which were without issues.\n\n1. Munge the URL and include the label for the revision. For example,\nhttp://host:8080/myprojects/index.html;r1.0.9. This was not considered\nacceptable because it is not permissible to munge URLs, and labels would\nhave to be provided for each collection in the path, not just the leaf\nresource.  Another problem is relative URLs would also have to contain\nrevision labels to get the right revision.\n\nNote that HTTP/1.1 does allow ; in a URL, and the text following could be\nused as a version label without violating any HTTP/1.1 rules. So this may\nnot be URL munging at all. Note also that index.html;r1.0.9 referes to a\nspecific revision of versioned resource index.html, no matter what versions\nof collection myprojects it may be in. So unless index.html has been\nremoved from some version of myprojects, it's not really necessary to\nspecify a version of the collection in order to reference a version of one\nof its members.\n\n2. Require users to use an redirect URL generated by the server when the\nrevision is created. This allows standard URLs to be used to access\nrevisions of versioned resources, but the URLs would likely have little\nresemblence to the URL of the versioned resource, and would probably not be\nmeaningful to human users.\n\n4. Put the revision label in as a header for each resource, and provide\nsome default if the revision is not specified. The default could be some\nfunctor like \"latest\". This works well for a single resource, but it\ndoesn't scale for collections, or a large number of resources as the client\nhas to keep too much revision information. You would need to use a revision\npath in the header, not just a revision in order to provide revisions for\nparent collections. The header would have to include labels, activities,\nconfigurations, and various functors to provide flexible URL mapping. This\nwould be a complicated header that would have to be retained by the\nclients, and set for each request. The server would be unaware of any\nversioning context it might be able to cache between requests.\n\n5. Use the primary rule of patterns: factor out the thing that changes into\na separate object and delegate. This is the workspace approach. We leave\nresource URL's alone, they are the same for all revisions. The URL of a\nversioned resource and all its revisions is the same as the URL of the\nresource before it was versioned. This requires no changes to existing\nWebDAV clients, and supports back-level clients on versioning servers.\nInstead of worrying about the particular revision of each resource\nrequested, the client creates a workspace which contains a revision\nselection rule that is reused for each request in the context of that\nworkspace. The semantics of the revision selection rule are well defined,\nsupport parallel development and configurations, and are supported by the\nserver. The client just sends a workspace URL in a header with each\nrequest, and it is used to resolve URLs to specific revisions. There would\nbe a default workspace whose revision selection rule contained only\n\"latest\" that is used if the header is not specified. Workspaces are\nresources that clients can develop editors to examine and set.\n\nThis works for back-level clients, DMS clients, and CM clients in a uniform\nway, is consistent with relative URLs, and is reasonably simple. It allows\nchecked out revisions, revisions in the current activity, revisions with\nspecific labels, in a specific activity, being merged in the current\nactivity, belonging to a configuration, latest, etc. to be accessed using a\nsingle mechanism. The downside is that DMS client applications will have to\nset the workspace. This shouldn't be too bad though because DMS systems\nwon't likely have multiple activities for parallel development and don't\nsupport configurations. It is likely the default workspace with checked out\nand latest in its revision selection rule will be adequate for most uses.\n\nFor Geoff's item 2), I don't think moving URL-1 to URL-2 would require any\nchanges to the revision selection rule in the workspace. Assume the\nrevision selection rule contains label R1.3.5, and URL-1 has a revision\nwith that label. When URL-1 is copied or moved to URL-2, the labels go with\nthe revisions. So a reference to URL-2 in the workspace would resolve to\nthe corret revision.\n\nItem 3) should also not be a problem. The workspace revision selection rule\ncan include functor \"latest\" which applies to all resources. So the\nworkspace would resolve all URLs to some revision, one that could be\nchecked out and modified. On checkin, the new revision would be visible to\nanyone using this workspace. In general, putting \"latest\" in a revision\nselection rule should be avoided, and if it is included, it must be the\nlast entry. This is because the user has not been specific about what\nrevisions his workspace should expose, and latest is a \"floating label\"\nthat moves with each new revision. This makes the workspace potentially\nunstable and may expose incompatible revisions. WebDAV must support latest\nthough, and it is the only acceptable default.\n\nWell, I guess it wasn't so brief after all. This is hard stuff, but I think\nwe're getting there. I'm keen to be sure that DMS systems are as consistent\nwith CM systems as possible while providing the additional flexibility for\nmutable revisions. This will allow these systems to co-exist, and for DMS\nclient applications to incrementally include CM capabilities over time\nwithout changing existing semantics.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10442175"}, {"subject": "Re: Discussion Topic: Simple Version Selection and Checkout", "content": ">because version selection is almost always done with a floating label\n>or \"branch/LATEST\", rather than a bunch of special cases for individual\n>resources.

Munge the URL and include the label for the revision. ...\n\nAlso, whether it is URL munging or not, it makes all inter-resource references\ntotally brittle (i.e. all documents containing references would have to\nbe modified whenever you created a new revision of a document they refer\nto) so we can discard this approach out-of-hand.\n\n   2. Require users to use an redirect URL generated by the server when the\n   revision is created. This allows standard URLs to be used to access\n   revisions of versioned resources, but the URLs would likely have little\n   resemblence to the URL of the versioned resource, and would probably not be\n   meaningful to human users.\n\nAlso same problem as choice 1.\n\n(Jim: You seem to have skipped choice 3. :-)\n\n   4. Put the revision label in as a header for each resource, and provide\n   some default if the revision is not specified. The default could be some\n   functor like \"latest\". This works well for a single resource, but it\n   doesn't scale for collections, or a large number of resources as the client\n   has to keep too much revision information. You would need to use a revision\n   path in the header, not just a revision in order to provide revisions for\n   parent collections. The header would have to include labels, activities,\n   configurations, and various functors to provide flexible URL mapping. This\n   would be a complicated header that would have to be retained by the\n   clients, and set for each request. The server would be unaware of any\n   versioning context it might be able to cache between requests.\n\nAlso, since clients would need to save these revision mappings for\nuse in a future session, and share these version maps with other clients,\nnot defining a standard way to store and share this revision selection\ninformation would pretty much eliminate any significant interoperability.\n\n   5. Use the primary rule of patterns: factor out the thing that changes into\n   a separate object and delegate. This is the workspace approach.\n\nYes.\n\n   We leave\n   resource URL's alone, they are the same for all revisions. The URL of a\n   versioned resource and all its revisions is the same as the URL of the\n   resource before it was versioned.\n\nHere I must partially disagree.\n\nI agree that the original URL (of the resource before it was put under\nversion control) should be usable to select any of the revisions of\nthat resource (based on the workspace revision-selection-rule).\nI also agree that this is the URL that you must use to modify the\nbody of a revision.\n\nBut I strongly disagree that the versioned-resource and all the\nrevisions should (or even could!) have the same URL (as each other, or\nas the original URL).  The versioned resource must have its own\n(server allocated) URL, because when you make it visible in several\nplaces in the URL space (which is a common requirement of document\nmanagement systems), you don't want the versioned resource to disappear\neverywhere just because you have applied a \"delete\" to the original\nURL.  You could play some games about the \"real\" versioned-resource\nmoving around to one of the other URL's, and then automatically\nupdating all the other URL's that refer to it, but that's just a good\nway to tie yourself into knots (and step smack in the middle of the\n\"strong references\" minefield).\n\nIn addition, given the desire for maintaining \"history\", you want a\na URL that can get you to the versioned resource, even after all current\nreferences to it have been deleted, and having the server generate\na URL for the versioned-resource that is separate from the original\ngives you that ability.\n\nNow as for the revisions having their own URL's, clearly they can't just\nhave the URL of the original resource (for similar reasons for why the\nversioned-resource can't have the URL of the original resource).  Since\nthey each will be given a unique id (wrt to versioned resource), clearly\nit would be easy for the server to give them each their own URL, and then\nwe wouldn't have to pass in a \"revision-id\" header every time we wanted\nto look at some revision that is not currently visible in our workspace\n(for example, when merging).\n\n   This requires no changes to existing\n   WebDAV clients, and supports back-level clients on versioning servers.\n   Instead of worrying about the particular revision of each resource\n   requested, the client creates a workspace which contains a revision\n   selection rule that is reused for each request in the context of that\n   workspace. The semantics of the revision selection rule are well defined,\n   support parallel development and configurations, and are supported by the\n   server. The client just sends a workspace URL in a header with each\n   request, and it is used to resolve URLs to specific revisions. There would\n   be a default workspace whose revision selection rule contained only\n   \"latest\" that is used if the header is not specified. Workspaces are\n   resources that clients can develop editors to examine and set.\n\nI agree with everything here.  One comment: although there will be a\ndefault revision-selection-rule for the default workspace, a client would\nbe able to modify the revision-selection-rule of the default workspace.\n\n   For Geoff's item 2), I don't think moving URL-1 to URL-2 would require any\n   changes to the revision selection rule in the workspace. Assume the\n   revision selection rule contains label R1.3.5, and URL-1 has a revision\n   with that label. When URL-1 is copied or moved to URL-2, the labels go with\n   the revisions. So a reference to URL-2 in the workspace would resolve to\n   the corret revision.\n\nIf you want to expose different revisions of the same versioned resource\nat different URL's in the same workspace, you would need to say which URL\nshould pick the one revision, and which should pick the other.  But if\nyou don't need/want to do this, I agree that there is no need for URL\nspecific clauses in the revision-selection-rule.  But for folks that do\nwant to do this, it's important that they know how it would interract\nwith workspace-based revision selection.\n\n   Item 3) should also not be a problem. The workspace revision selection rule\n   can include functor \"latest\" which applies to all resources. So the\n   workspace would resolve all URLs to some revision, one that could be\n   checked out and modified. On checkin, the new revision would be visible to\n   anyone using this workspace. In general, putting \"latest\" in a revision\n   selection rule should be avoided, and if it is included, it must be the\n   last entry.

This makes the workspace potentially\n   unstable and may expose incompatible revisions. WebDAV must support latest\n   though, and it is the only acceptable default.\n\nActually, the issue I was raising wasn't that \"there would be a\nrevision you couldn't put in a workspace\" (with an appropriate\nrevision-selection-rule you can make any revision appear a workspace),\nbut rather that you can only apply CHECKOUT (and then PUT) to a\nrevision using it's original URL (what the protocol calls a\n\"vportal\"), and *not* using the URL of the revision.\n\nIn your description, this is trivially true, because you weren't going\nto allocate a separate URL for the versioned-resource or any of the revisions.\nAnd I agree that this would be an advantage of not allocating those\nURL's, but unfortunately I really care about the baby swimming in that\nbathwater (:-).\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10457053"}, {"subject": "Re: Discussion Topic: Simple Version Selection and Checkout", "content": "   From: \"Sankar Virdhagriswaran\" <sv@crystaliz.com>\n\n   >because version selection is almost always done with a floating label\n   >or \"branch/LATEST\", rather than a bunch of special cases for individual\n   >resources.

This change\nhas the very limited purpose of making label updating more reliable.\nIn my proposal, you cannot use a label URL to see the body of a resource,\n(you would have to use a vportal in a workspace to do that), so Jim and\nI agree on the functionality that a label should (and should not) provide.\n\n   Anyhow, I have a specific use case\n   point and a broader architecture point.\n\n   1) Architecture point\n\n   Let me start with the architecture point. Configurations, IMHO, define an\n   alternate namespace. The objects associated with the names could be 'bound'\n   using a one to one mapping between names and objects and using a selection\n   rule based on attributes of the object.\n\nIn my proposal, I was using the term \"configuration\" to refer to an immutable\nresource that does the first kind of mapping (i.e. 1-1 mapping between names\nand immutable-revisions), and the term \"workspace\" to refer to a resource\nthat defines a mutable mapping via a revision selection rule.\n\n   The labeling scheme I thought was the second kind\n\nYes.\n\n   and the explicit naming as seen in traditional version\n   control system I thought was the first kind.\n\nYou find both concepts in most traditional version control systems.\nIn particular, you find some persistent mapping of names to immutable\nrevisions (e.g. a file containing an \"S-List\" in traditional SCCS systems),\nand a workspace or \"sandbox\" where a mutable mapping is located.\n\n   I would like to see the\n   architecture of the configuration namespace mechanism to be similar to\n   other\n   namespace mechanisms inside DAV and outside so that one could leverage\n   implementations and implementation experience. In particular, if you look\n   at\n   the ADSI spec. from Microsoft or JNDI spec. from Javasoft, they provide two\n   ways of resolving names to objects - explicit naming and selection by\n   attribute. The collection mechanism in DAV (should) also provides similar\n   mechanisms. If our scheme is similar in nature, we could use leverage\n   implementations and expertise across different types of namespaces, but\n   using the same type of framework.\n\nWe need to be a little careful about where we look for analogues.  The\nproblems faced by parallel development, with branching and merging,\nintroduces complexities that are often ignored by general namespace mapping\nmechanisms.  In particular, the notion of a set of changes that need to\nbe applied together is a key notion underlying effective version management,\nwhich makes it more akin to database transactions, than to namespace\nmanagement.  But we *also* want to manage the namespace, which is what\nmakes the problem so \"interesting\" (:-).\n\n   2) Use case point\n\n   ..., in authoring documents, it makes it much easier if\n   explicit names are used to do link checking and deployment.\n\nYes, I (and I'm sure, Jim) completely agree, as long as the explicit names\nare not to specific revisions, but rather to \"what your workspace is currently\nselecting at this URL\".\n\nIf instead you try to store explicit revision URL's in your documents,\n(not that you were suggesting this, but just to emphasize the point)\nany update to a document requires finding and updating all other\ndocuments that pointed explicitly to the previous revision of that\ndocument.  Since all those other documents are under version control,\nthey need to be checked out and a new revision created for them as well,\nwhich means all references to *them* must then be checked out and\nrevised, which means ... any change pretty soon requires a modification\nmost documents in your web site (not to mention all documents outside\nyour web site that stored explicit revision references).\n\nIt's this scenario that makes us pretty devoted to the \"everything goes\nthrough a workspace\" approach.\n\n   I have sense\n   that you folks think of a configuration or workspace in the software\n   development sense of the word. One could think of an HTML document itself\n   as\n   a configuration. In this case, an author will not typically be referring to\n   (i.e., linking to) multiple versions of the same document. The author would\n   like to refer to a linked document with an explicit URL reference.  In this\n   kind of authoring mode, selecting a URL of a linked document using labels\n   is\n   foreign to the author and more importantly to the authoring tool.\n\nWe need to carefully separate what the user sees and does (which is defined\nby his GUI) from what protocol the client uses to communicate this to the\nserver.  The user can say \"I want a new revision of this URL\".  The client\nthen can ask the server to create a new revision (CHECKOUT-NEW), and then\nask the server to place a label on this revision so that it will appear in\nthe user's current workspace.  The user gets to see the desired new revision,\nand never has to know anything about labels.\n\n   I am making several points here:\n\n   a) That document authors would prefer to use direct and explicit references\n   ( use case style point), and\n\nAgreed, with the caveat above that these are direct and explicit\nreferences to workspace URL's (what the protocol calls \"vportals\"),\nnot to specific revisions.\n\n   b) Tools such as link checkers and deployers can deal with explicit\n   references much more easily than resolved names based on attributes (i.e.,\n   labels)\n\nYes.  (The server does all the workspace name-mapping for those tools).\n\n   c) If one were to consider an HTML (or XML + XML Link) document itself as a\n   configuration, then label based selection involves cooperation by authoring\n   clients. I believe that this would be harder to achieve as compared to\n   browsers/DAV clients providing the same functionality.\n\nI didn't follow the point being made in c).\n\n   Does this all make sense to you folks?\n   Bottom line: I am arguing for providing explicit names and attribute based\n   selection. I am also arguing that the specification of this part of the\n   protocol should be similar to DAV collections and other namespace/directory\n   mechanisms out there.\n\nExplicit names: Yes, but not to specific revisions.\nAttribute based selection: Yes, in a workspace revision-selection-rule.\nSimilar to DAV collections: Yes, in that it is based on DAV collections\n  (i.e. a DAV collection provides a single segment in the URL path).\nSimiilar to other namespace/directory mechanisms out there: Well, depends\n  on which other mechanisms, and what you mean by \"similar\".\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10494547"}, {"subject": "Re: Fw: Discussion Topic: Simple Version Selection and Checkout", "content": ">I think that Sankar, Jim, and I all agree on the key point, namely that\n>users (and tools) want to deal with normal understandable URL's, not URL's\n>that have been munged and mangled with labels or server-defined\n>transformations.\n\n\nYes.

One is that our ideas and proposals have\nbeen complicated by listing lots of options, motivations, and issues making\nit difficult to understand, and two, perhaps we haven't been as clear as we\ncould have been in describing the versioning semantics. In any case, I\nthought it might be a good idea to just summarize where I think we are so\nfar as simply and completely as possible. Hopefully this will answer some\nquestions, provide a clear starting point for next week's versioning\nmeeting.\n\nI will attempt to summarize the semantics and rules that Geoff and I have\nbeen working on, and that have been discussed the last few weeks on\nxml-dav-versioning. I won't in this document present a lot of alternatives,\nmotivation for why we picked one semantic over another, or raise any\nissues. These will come later. I will however try to present versioning,\nparallel development, configuration management, DMS, and CM semantics as\nsimply and completely as possible so we can see the big picture. Assuming\nwe can nail down these semantics, the protocol should be pretty straight\nforward to design.\n\nCreating Versioned Resources\n\nA resource can be put under version control by checking it in. Checking in\na resource creates a versioned resource and sets its initial revision to\nthe resource. A checked in revision cannot be modified by anyone at any\ntime.\n\nNaming Revisions: revision ids and labels\n\nA revision of a versioned resource is given a system assigned revision id\nwhen it is checked in. This revision id acts as an immutable identifier\ndistinguishing this revision from all others of the same versioned\nresource. A revision id can be assigned to only one revision of a versioned\nresource, and can never be reused on that versioned resource.\n\nA user may assign other revision names called revision labels to a revision\nin order to distinguish it from other revisions using more meaningful\nnames. These revision labels must be unique for any given versioned\nresource, but may be reassigned to any revision of the versioned resource\nat any time. Revisions of different versioned resources may have the same\nlabel. There is a distinguished, floating label called \"latest\" which\nalways refers to the latest revision in a given activity.\n\nModifying a Versioned Resource\n\nA versioned resource may be modified by checking out a revision to create a\nworking resource. A working resource can be updated (PUT, PROPPATCH, etc.)\nany number of times. When updates are complete, the working resource is\nchecked back in. Users can use checkout/checkin to register intent to\nmodify a versioned resource similar to the way lock and unlock are used in\nDAV level 2. The sense is reversed though. A checked in revision cannot be\nchanged without checking it out first.\n\nA revision may be checked in as mutable or immutable. If the revision is\nmutable, a subsequent checkout makes the revision a working resource, and\nallows the revision to be updated in place without creating a new revision.\nAny previous contents of the revision are lost. A mutable revision can also\nbe checked out creating a new revision if the user wants to retain the\nprevious revision. If the revision is immutable, a checkout must create a\nnew revision. Servers may choose to not allow revisions to be checked in as\nmutable, or they may not allow a revision to be checked out without\ncreating a new revision. These constraints are typical of current\nconfiguration management systems. Document management systems typically\nallow revisions to be mutable and don't have these restrictions.\n\nParallel Development with Activities\n\nResources are checked out in the context of an activity. An activity\nabstracts a set of related changes a user is making to versioned resources.\nEach activity represents a parallel thread of development. Servers that\ndon't support parallel development only support one activity. A revision\nthat is already checked out in an activity cannot be checked out again in\nthe same activity. If parallel development is desired, a user can checkout\nthe revision in another activity and merge them later.\n\nSelecting Revision through the Workspace\n\nResources, working resources, and revisions of versioned resources are all\naccessed using a URL. Specific revisions of a versioned resource can be\naccessed by specifying the resource URL and a version label. However,\nversioned resources are usually accessed using a simple URL. The revision\nselected when a specific revision name is not specified is resolved through\na workspace. A workspace provides a mapping between URLs for versioned\nresources, and specific revisions. This allows versioned resources and\nunversioned resources to be accessed the same way supporting relative ULRs\nand DAV level-2 clients that are not versioning aware.\n\nA workspace contains a current activity, a merge activity, and a revision\nselection rule. Revisions are selected using the following rules in order:\n1) if there is a checked out revision, then it is selected. else 2) if\nthere is a revision that is checked in under the current activity, then it\nis selected, else 3) if the resource is a member of any activity in the\nprocess of being merged into this workspace, then it is selected, else 4)\nfinally, the workspace revision selection rule is applied to select the\nrevision. If there is no matching revision, then a resource not found\nstatus is returned. This rule is applied to collections to select the\nrevision that determines their member versioned resources, and to other\nresource to determine the revision containing their contents.\n\nA workspace revision selection rule can specify any number of revision\nlabels, activities, configurations, or the functor \"latest\" to specify what\nrevision to select. The rules are applied in order until the first matching\nis found. Any subsequent potential matches are ignored. The first three\nrules above are just implied components of the workspace revision selection\nrule. They are called out separately as they are fixed by the server.\n\nIf a request is made and no workspace is specified, a default workspace\ncontaining activity named \"mainline\", and \"latest\" in the version selection\nrule is used.\n\nConfiguration Management\n\nA workspace represents a volatile set of revisions. Any new checkouts,\nchanges to the current activity, merging operations, or changes to the\nrevision selection rule may result in the selection of different revisions.\nA configuration is a resource that represents an immutable set of\nrevisions. A configuration contains a specific revision of each member\nversioned resource. A configuration cannot contain a mutable revision\nbecause the semantics of configurations cannot be guaranteed. A workspace\nwhose version selection rule contains a configuration will always return\nthe same revisions as long as there are no revisions checked out and\nnothing in the current activity.\n\nVersioned Collections\n\nA collection contains a set of members. For versioned collections, the\nmembers are versioned resources, not particular revisions. To add or remove\nmembers from a revision of a versioned collection, it must be checked out\njust like any other resource. Creating a new revision of a member, or\nmodifying a member has no effect on the collection. Deleting a versioned\nresource that is an internal member from a collection does not delete the\nversioned resource, it only deletes the member from that version of the\ncollection. The resource may still be a member of a previous or subsequent\nrevision of the collection. The URL for a collection without a particular\nrevision name is resolved to a particular revision using the workspace the\nsame as any other resource. If the collection is part of a URL for some\nother resource, then its members are determined from the selected revision.\n\nRevision History\n\nEach revision has a predecessor relationship with the revision it was\nchecked out or merged from, and a successor relationship with revisions\nthat were checked out from it. Mutable revisions are related to their\npredecessor through a was-derived-from relationship. Immutable revisions\nare related to their predecessor through an is-derived-from relationship.\nThe revision history of a versioned resource can include either or both of\nthese relationships.\n\nMerging\n\nEach activity represents a separate parallel thread of development. Users\nmake their changes in the context of an activity. Changes to the same\nrevision must be done in separate activities. At some point, a user may\nwant to merge changes made to the same revision together to create a new\nrevision containing the combined updates. In order to do a merge, it is\nfirst necessary to determine what must be merged. A merge conflict report\nlists the resources that have been modified in parallel in different\nactivities. The merge conflict report is generated using the following\nrules: 1) if the merge source specifies a predecessor of the revision\nselected by the workspace, then the workspace revision is selected, else 2)\nif the merge source specifies a successor of the revision selected by the\nworkspace, then the merge source revision is selected, else 3) the merge\nsource and the current workspace specify revisions that are on different\nlines-of-descent, and a potential merge conflict exists and is included in\nthe merge conflict report.\n\nA user can request the differences between two revisions of a resource\n(servers may provide a differences report, but they must at least indicate\nif they are the same or not). A user can request conflicts between an\nactivity and the current workspace to generate a merge conflict report. A\nuser can also request the differences between a configuration and the\ncurrent workspace which lists at least the activities that are contained in\nthe configuration but not in the workspace and vice versa. So differences\nare detected at different levels: content differences for resources,\nrevision differences for activities, and activity differences for\nconfigurations.\n\nOnce the merge conflicts are known, a user resolves the conflicts by\nmerging the source activity with the workspace. This enters the merge\nsource into the workspace, and sets the current conflicts that must be\nresolved. The conflicts are resolved by merging the revisions from the\nmerge source into the revision selected by the workspace to create a new\nworking resource. Servers may perform some default auto merging, but at a\nminimum, the merge is done by checking out the revision in the current\nactivity and noting the merge from the merge source. This creates an\nadditional successor/predecessor relationship between the merge source and\nworkspace revisions called merged-from. The conflict is now removed because\nthe working resource is now a successor of both the source and target\nrevisions. It is the user's responsibility to apply the differences in the\ntwo revisions in an appropriate manner. The merge is complete when all the\nconflicts are resolved, all differences have been merged, and the resources\nare all checked back in. The merge source can now be removed from the\nworkspace as all of its changes are now included in the current activity.\nOnly one activity can be merged at a time.\n\nWhen merging mutable revisions, the merge conflict report may be inaccurate\nas the source revision may change without the system being aware. Users are\nresponsible for applying any changes to ancestor revisions to their\ndescendants as appropriate. The system cannot determine if there are any\nchanges that need to be applied other than by looking a the last-modified\ndates of the revisions.\n\nLocking Versioned Resources\n\nLocking a versioned resource prevents any revision from being checked out\nin any activity. Locking a revision of a versioned resource prevents just\nthat revision from being checked out in any activity.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10513771"}, {"subject": "WebDAV Versioning Model", "content": "--0__=Y2POLT1gC2CXyjE0VwtryzPozZrYVOq0u8mliYFYfcesdwLvImk0KcCn\nContent-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Disposition: inline\n\n\n\nAttached is the latest WebDAV versioning model.

This is\nmotivated by a desire not to have working groups keep expanding their\nmission to self-perpetuate, and to ensure that the working group doesn't get\n\"stale\" with the same cast of characters rehashing the same issues.\n\nNow, I don't think the WebDAV working group has fallen into any of these\ntraps yet -- we continue to make good progress on the versioning protocol,\nand the advanced collections protocol.  We haven't strayed from our original\ncharter.  Now that the WebDAV Distriubted Authoring protocol has been\napproved, we're starting to see lots of public announcements by companies of\ntheir WebDAV product plans (see http://www.webdav.org/projects/).  There is\nalso increasing interest in open source development of WebDAV applications,\nsignificantly helped by Greg Stein's webdav.org site.  All these are signs\nof robust health.\n\nSo, you might ask, if it ain't broke, why fix it?  Well, one good reason is\nthat Keith Moore, our Applications Area advisor thinks the time is right.\nBut, more generally, I look at it as a case of preventative medicine.  By\ncreating a separate versioning working group, with its own separate charter,\nseveral positive goals are accomplished:\n\n * It sends a signal that new people can become involved and participate.\n\n   While it's always the case that new people can get involved in an\n   IETF effort, it's often difficult to know when you can get involved\n   without annoying people who have been working on the topic for awhile.\n   For example, Mark Anderson's comments on draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-09\n   last fall were well intentioned, but had terrible timing.\n\n * It provides the opportunity to refresh the agreement over what work is\nbeing done.\n\n   Most people on the mailing list today didn't have a chance to discuss the\n   original WebDAV charter.  Even if there is common agreement that the\ncharter\n   of the versioning working group should continue in the same vein as\ncurrent\n   efforts, it still is worthwhile to make sure that *current* list members\n   agree with the goals.\n\n * It forces people to explicitly subscribe to a new mailing list.\n\n   Though it may seem funny to list this as a positive, working group\nmailing\n   lists tend to attract a lot of lurkers over time, people who want to\ntrack an\n   effort rather than being an active participant.  You might be surprised\nto\n   know that the WebDAV mailing list now has appx. 350 people on it!\nObviously\n   you're not all active participants :-) (Although I very much appreciate\n   having such a large pool of people to call on for volunteers for various\n   activities). By causing people to reaffirm their interest by joining a\nnew\n   list, it tends to \"refresh\" the membership.\n\n * It allows the burden of work to be more evenly shared.\n\n   This one is more of a personal motivation, but it does impact the\n   working group as a whole.  The motivation and ability to participate\n   of the hardest working people in a working group is hard to sustain\n   over several years, and it's good to have some rotation of duties.\n   If too much is asked of the same people for too long, the working\n   group suffers immensely when they, inevitably, are no longer able to\n   participate any longer.\n\nMany of you know that I have been working towards my Ph.D. degree while\nbeing chair of WebDAV.  And, truth be told, my participation has definitely\ndelayed my graduation.  I have no regrets -- this has been an excellent\nexperience, the kind of activity I wanted to be able to work on during grad.\nschool.  Plus, interacting with members of the working group has been very\nrewarding, both professionally and personally.  Still, I'm at least a year\naway from graduation if I have complete focus on my degree, and I need to\nget more of WebDAV off my plate to do this.\n\nSo, while I still intend to continue on as chair of the WebDAV working\ngroup, working to finish up advanced collections, and work on issues from\nthe issues list, and resolve any interoperability problems that may arise, I\nintend that the efforts on versioning and advanced collections will form new\nworking groups.  I will not chair those new groups, though I will help form\nthem, and make sure they get a good start.  My goal is to create continuity\nfrom the current WebDAV working group into the new working groups, to make\nsure none of the momentum we have is lost.\n\nThere is successful precedent for this in the DASL working group, which has\nbeen making steady progress towards defining a searching protocol for DAV\nresources (http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/dasl/).  DASL shows the strength\nof creating a new working group -- it has a different set of people working\non it than who developed the base WebDAV protocol, people who have deep\nsearching experience.  Their mailing list collected people who had interest\nin the searching problem, helping ensure that their discussions are focused,\nand not lost in other topics on the main DAV list.  DASL is the right model\nfor what the working groups on versioning and access control can accomplish.\n\nAt the bottom of this message is a proposed charter for the versioning\nworking group, which I have tentatively named \"DELTA-V\" (you know, to\nemphasize they're creating extensions to DAV -- \"delta\" -- and are working\non the \"V\" part of DAV. :-)  I'd appreciate any comments you have on the\ncharter -- send them to the main WebDAV list.  You can also expect to see\nanother charter in the near future to develop an access control working\ngroup, but I don't have this one done yet.\n\nI look forward to working with you to develop these new working groups, and\nto setting the stage for the completion of the original WebDAV goals,\ncreating a writeable, versioned collaborative Web.\n\n- Jim\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nWeb Versioning and Configuration Management (DELTA-V)\n\nChair(s):\n\nTBD (Though Jim Whitehead emphatically declines to be chair)\n\nApplications Area Director(s):\n\nKeith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu>\nPatrik Faltstrom <paf@swip.net>\n\nApplications Area Advisor:\n\nTBD, probably Keith Moore <moore@cs.utk.edu>\n\nMailing Lists:\n\nGeneral Discussion: ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org\nTo Subscribe: ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org\nSubject: subscribe\nArchive: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-dav-versioning/\n\nDescription of Working Group:\n\nxThis working group will define extensions to HTTP and the WebDAV\nDistributed Authoring Protocol necessary to enable distributed Web\nauthoring tools to perform, in an interoperable manner, versioning and\nconfiguration management of Web resources.\n\nVersioning, parallel development, and configuration management are\nimportant features for remote authoring of Web content.  Version\nmanagement is concerned with tracking and accessing the history of\nimportant states of a single Web resource, such as a standalone Web\npage.  Parallel development provides additional resource availability\nin multi-user, distributed environments, letting authors make changes\non the same resource at the same time, later merging together those\nchanges. Configuration management addresses the problems of tracking\nand accessing multiple interrelated resources over time as sets of\nresources, not simply individual resources.  Traditionally, artifacts\nof software development, including code, design, test cases,\nrequirements, help files, and more have been a focus of configuration\nmanagement. Web sites, comprised of multiple inter-linked resources\n(HTML, graphics, sound, CGI, and others), are an important class of\ncomplex information artifacts that benefit from the application of\nconfiguration management.\n\nThe WebDAV working group originally focused on defining version\nmanagement capabilities for remote authoring applications. However, it\nhas become clear that while versioning functionality alone is useful\nfor a range of content authoring scenarios involving one, or a small\nset of resources, versioning alone is insufficient for managing larger\nsets of content. Protocol support for parallel development and simple\nremote configuration management of Web resources provides\nfunctionality for managing larger sets of interrelated content\ndeveloped by multiple users at different locations.\n\nA sub-group of the WebDAV working group has developed functional\nrequirements for versioning and configuration management of Web\ncontent. These requirements encompass the following capabilities,\nwhich shall be considered by this working group:\n\nIN-SCOPE:\n\n* Naming and accessing resource versions and configurations\n* Creating new revisions of a resource\n* Placing a resource under version and configuration control\n* History retrieval\n* Differencing\n* Merging of revisions and configurations\n* Operations on configurations\n* Mapping resource versions and configurations to the URL namespace\n* Versioning support for downlevel HTTP and WebDAV clients\n\nFurther information on these objectives can be found in the document,\n\"Goals for Web Versioning\".\n\nNOT IN SCOPE:\n\n* HTTP server to server communication protocols\n* Versioning and configuration management via non-HTTP and WebDAV protocols.\n* Implementation of functionality by non-origin proxies\n\nDeliverables\n\nThe final output of this working group is expected to be two documents:\n\n1. A goals document, which describes the high-level functional\n   requirements for remote versioning and configuration management,\n   including rationale. Jim Amsden, IBM, is editor of this document.\n\n2. A model document, which describes the semantics of versioning,\n   configuration management, and parallel development in a\n   protocol independent fashion.  Editor: TBD\n\n2. A protocol specification, which describes new HTTP methods,\n   headers, request bodies, response bodies, and WebDAV properties to\n   implement the remote versioning and configuration management\n   goals. Chris Kaler, Microsoft, is editor of this document.\n\nGoals and Milestones:\n\nSince significant work on remote versioning and configuration\nmanagement has already taken place within the WebDAV working group,\nthe following schedule is a reasonable estimate of the remaining\neffort, despite the scope of the working group.\n\nJun 99 (Specification, Goals, Model) Produce drafts of distributed\n       versioning and configuration management protocol specification,\n       as well as the goals and requirements documents.

I'll outline the ideas and describe the basic\n     scenarios.  I'll describe the scenarios using software development\n     nomenclature and assume use of a branching SCM system. The topic of\n     this post is if and how such scenarios would be supported assuming\n     they apply to web content management.\n\n     Note that both Case 1 and Case 2 represent SCM process choices that\n     are commonly used.  For good or bad they represent two ways that\n     parallel development is managed at Company X.\n\n     Case 1: Version V1 of a product ZOO has reached its feature complete\n     milestone (FC), which for this project means it has all its intended\n     features, but still has bugs to be fixed.  At this point some\n     developers will continue fixing bugs in version V1, but others will\n     move on to work on the next version (V2).  The V1 code is on the\n     mainline. Because further changes to V1 are intended to be minimized\n     and the V2 work is a natural evolution of the V1 work, V2 work will\n     continue on the mainline.  Also, it is important that all bug fixes\n     for V1 also be immediately reflected in the V2 work.  So V1 bug fixes\n     also will be reflected on the mainline.  If a resource needs to be\n     changed for a V1 fix and it has already been fixed modified on the\n     mainline for V2, then the V1 change is made on a branch and also on\n     the mainline.  Otherwise, if no V2 changes have yet been made to the\n     resource the V1 change is only made on the mainline.  Thus the V2\n     version of ZOO is just the tip of the mainline, whereas the V1 version\n     must be obtained from a fixed configuration (via a fixed label, or\n     whatever mechanism is used) and this configuration must be updated\n     with each bug fix to V1.\n\n     Case 2: Version V1 of product ZOO has been released and version V2\n     development is well underway.  A key customer has contracted to have a\n     specific enhancement made to V1 specifically for them, the resulting\n     version is referred to as V1-A.  The V1-A enhancement is superseded by\n     different features that will be available with the V2 release, but the\n     customer does not wish to wait for V2 to complete.  All work on V1-A\n     will not be used in V2.  Therefore all V1-A changes are made on\n     branches newly created just for V1-A.\n\n     So, how would a WebDAV server that supports versioning (using the\n     current proposal) support these two cases?\n\n     TRY1: An ACTIVITY is directly related to a branch.  Creating a new\n     activity means creating a new branch.  This branching policy supports\n     case 2, but I don't see how it can easily support case 1.  In Case 2\n     the desire behavior is obtained by continuing V2 using the V1 Activity\n     and creating a new activity for V1-A.  In case 1 the V2 activity does\n     not want to create a new branch, so it must continue to use the V1\n     activity.  Then V1 bug fixes would have to go into a new activity\n     forcing a new branch with every change, but is just case 2 and does\n     not match the branching policy of case 1.\n\n     TRY2: An Activity uses the following branch policy:\n     * if the selected revision to be checkout is the latest then check it\n     out on the same branch it is on.\n     * if the selected revision is not the latest, then check it out on a\n     new branch associated with the activity.\n\n     The TRY2 branching policy works for Case 1.  The V1 activity continues\n     to be used even after the V2 activity is created.  Only resources that\n     have been modified by V2 cause V1 to branch.  Because V1 does not work\n     off of latest, it will not cause V2 to branch, but all changes to V1\n     on the original branch will be picked up by V2 and non of the others.\n\n     However TRY2 does not provide the desired behavior for CASE 2.\n     Creating a new Activity for V1-A does not necessarily result in a new\n     branch.\n\n     Understand, the point here is not to find some way to manage cases 1\n     and 2 using the Activity mechanism, but to find a way to do it and\n     preserve the branching policies of Company X.  This is important to\n     Company X because they want to continue using their SCM procedures and\n     have their new WebDAV server fit into this existing system.\n\n     I don't see how this can be done without some indication being given\n     as to which branching policy is desired for each Activity.  Such an\n     indication could be in the form of a property on the Activity or an\n     option in the creation of the activity. Alternatively or in addition,\n     an administrator might specify which branching policies were allowed\n     for a set of resources.  The indication of which policy to use could\n     be abstract and general, e.g. Principle vs. Supporting activity.  Or\n     the indication could be an implementation specific property.  A third\n     idea would be to see if a few specific types of activities could be\n     defined to meet known needs and leave the door open for adding new\n     ones later.\n\n     None of these choices fills me with glee.  I'm probably missing\n     something.  Help me out.\n\n     --Sarge\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10661417"}, {"subject": "FYI: Osmic", "content": "Ted Nelson, the researcher who coined the term \"hypertext\" and who worked\nfor many years on the Xanadu system, has recently been working on\nversioning, as part of his Osmic system.

For details on Osmic, including access\nto the code for a running demo, go to URL:\n\nhttp://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/OSMIC/OSMICpage.html\n\nThe versioning model is described more at:\n\nhttp://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~ted/OSMIC/osmicTime.html\n\nIMO, one of the fundamental departure points between the Osmic work and the\nWebDAV versioning work is that WebDAV provides the same versioning\nfacilities to all content types.  Providing more fine-grain versioning\nrequires content type specific knowledge so you know what the basic\noperators are for that content type (what does \"insert\" mean for a bitmap\nimage?).  Internal knowledge about the content type is needed if the content\ntype has a checksum, or a complex internal structure, which prevents it from\nbeing treated solely as a set of bytes for merge operations. In turn, the\ncontent-type specific knowledge then makes the protocol more brittle, since\nit is now dependent on the definition of the content type, and many\nfrequently-used content types on the Web are in constant evolution, making a\nprotocol based on them brittle.  Of course, if you limit yourself, as Osmic\ndoes, to ASCII text (a stable, and widely supported content type) these\nproblems don't appear.\n\n- Jim\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10669341"}, {"subject": "Time for weekly Versioning Conference Call", "content": "I'm setting up a weekly versioning conference call, similar in purpose\nto the weekly advanced-collections call that Judy is running.

As well, we need to understand the\nsemantics of parallel checkouts in the \"default workspace\".  The current\ndefinition of a workspaces prohibits this and I think it is an important\nrequirement for level 1.\n\n<jra>\nLevel 1 revision selection rules don't need to be complicated at all. There\nare no activities or configurations, so the revision selection rule has\ncheckedout and 0 or more labels. When a resource is accessed with a simple\nURL, this means, get the checked out revision if any, otherwise look for a\nrevision that has a matchin label. It's hard to imagine anything simpler.\n</jra>\n\nGeoff and I started talking about the Revision-Id header yesterday.  I\nthink\nit is reasonable for a client to request version X of /foo/bar.htm.  It\nseems a cumbersome requirement to have to set the revision of /foo/bar.htm\nin the default workspace to be X and get /foo/bar.htm.  As well, this won't\nscale at all.  Imagine one person trying to get version X and one trying to\nget version Y.  We clearly need more discussion on this, but I don't yet\nsee\nhow we can eliminate a header that specifies a revision.  I do believe that\nwe could condense several headers into one...\n\n<jra>\nI also belive that users want to access specific revisions given the label.\nIf they can assign a label, they should be able to access the resource that\nthey assigned the label to. Recall that this capability is in the model. In\nthe new version I moved the method to Repository.getResource(url : String,\nlabel : String = null) : Resource. There's also Repository.getResource(url\n: String, context Workspace) : Resource to access a resource in the context\nof a workspace. One reason you would want to do this is if you want to look\nat an old version, or compare two revisions, and don't want to change your\nworkspace.\n\nMy issue isn't that I didn't want access by labels, only that access when\nlabels aren't specified should use Workspaces to resolve the URL.\n</jra>\n\nI, personally, think that RSR are interesting but probably too complicated\nfor level 1 servers.  We could say that the SETDEFAULT method is a\n\"utility\"\nmethod that modifies the workspace to use the specified revision of the\nspecified resource.  This allows us to still describe level 1 functionality\nin the context of level 2 workspaces.  And for level 2, it provides a handy\nservice for augmenting an RSR without having to pull it, modify it, and put\nit.\n\n<jra>\nAgain, I don't think revision selection rules are complicate at all,\nespecially for level 1 which doesn't have activities, merging, or\nconfigurations. The complexity results from introducing multiple revisions.\nLeaving workspaces out of level 1 will just move the complexity to the\nclient or user who have to remember lots of labels on a resource by\nresource basis. This makes the server simpler, but not WebDAV.\n\nI stress again, what would anyone want to do with versioning level 1 that\nworkspaces wouldn't support? What would workspaces include that would be\nconsidered too much for level 1? We need specific scenarios that address\nthese issues. As you know, I am also keen to keep things simple.

For your item 1 below, the default\nworkspace does just what you want.

When a resource is accessed with a\nsimple\nURL, this means, get the checked out revision if any, otherwise look\nfor a\nrevision that has a matchin label. It's hard to imagine anything\nsimpler.\n</jra>\n\nGeoff and I started talking about the Revision-Id header yesterday.  I\nthink\nit is reasonable for a client to request version X of /foo/bar.htm.\nIt\nseems a cumbersome requirement to have to set the revision of\n/foo/bar.htm\nin the default workspace to be X and get /foo/bar.htm.  As well, this\nwon't\nscale at all.  Imagine one person trying to get version X and one\ntrying to\nget version Y.  We clearly need more discussion on this, but I don't\nyet\nsee\nhow we can eliminate a header that specifies a revision.  I do believe\nthat\nwe could condense several headers into one...\n\n<jra>\nI also belive that users want to access specific revisions given the\nlabel.\nIf they can assign a label, they should be able to access the resource\nthat\nthey assigned the label to. Recall that this capability is in the\nmodel. In\nthe new version I moved the method to Repository.getResource(url :\nString,\nlabel : String = null) : Resource. There's also\nRepository.getResource(url\n: String, context Workspace) : Resource to access a resource in the\ncontext\nof a workspace. One reason you would want to do this is if you want to\nlook\nat an old version, or compare two revisions, and don't want to change\nyour\nworkspace.\n\nMy issue isn't that I didn't want access by labels, only that access\nwhen\nlabels aren't specified should use Workspaces to resolve the URL.\n</jra>\n\nI, personally, think that RSR are interesting but probably too\ncomplicated\nfor level 1 servers.  We could say that the SETDEFAULT method is a\n\"utility\"\nmethod that modifies the workspace to use the specified revision of\nthe\nspecified resource.  This allows us to still describe level 1\nfunctionality\nin the context of level 2 workspaces.  And for level 2, it provides a\nhandy\nservice for augmenting an RSR without having to pull it, modify it, and\nput\nit.\n\n<jra>\nAgain, I don't think revision selection rules are complicate at all,\nespecially for level 1 which doesn't have activities, merging, or\nconfigurations. The complexity results from introducing multiple\nrevisions.\nLeaving workspaces out of level 1 will just move the complexity to the\nclient or user who have to remember lots of labels on a resource by\nresource basis. This makes the server simpler, but not WebDAV.\n\nI stress again, what would anyone want to do with versioning level 1\nthat\nworkspaces wouldn't support? What would workspaces include that would\nbe\nconsidered too much for level 1? We need specific scenarios that\naddress\nthese issues. As you know, I am also keen to keep things simple.

DAV versioning level 1 will still need to be a way of resolving\naccess\nto versioned resources given just a URL (and not a label). If\nworkspaces\naren't supported, level 1 servers will have to provide some other way\nto\nresolve URLs to specific revisions, perhaps a default revision for\neach\nversioned resource. For level 2 servers that do support workspaces,\nthis\nwould result in two, potentially conflicting ways of performing URL\nmapping. This is a strong argument for including workspaces in level\n1.\nWhat would anyone want to do with versioning level 1 that workspaces\nwouldn't support? What would workspaces include that would be\nconsidered\ntoo much for level 1? If there are no compelling answers to these\nquestions, we should include workspaces in level 1, including the\ndefault\nworkspace.\n\n[CK] I suggest we keep the Revision-Id header and the SETDEFAULT\nmethod.\n\n2. Deleting a resource must explicitly state that the resource is\nremoved\nfrom its parent collection; that is, the collection with which the\nresource\nis an internal member. Versioning complicates delete semantics. There\nare\nthree things we might want to delete: an unversioned or working\nresource, a\nrevision (and all its descendents?) of a versioned resource, a\nversioned\nresource and all its revision history. This must be done in the context\nof\nversioned and unversioned collections that contain the resource, or\nversioned resource as an internal member. The preferred way to do this\nwould be to have add and remove methods on collections to create and\ndelete\nresources as its the collection that controls the namespace.\nUnfortunately,\nDAV doesn't have those semantics, so we will have to find a work-around\nfor\nversioning.\n\n[CK] I expect deleting a working resource to be the same as\nUNCHECKOUT.\n[CK] Deleting a versioned resource is up to the store.  Some stores\nmight\n[CK] just delete it.  Some might create an \"delete\" version.  I don't\nthink\n[CK] we want to push a specific model on people.  Especially since the\n[CK] DELETE method is about a resource and in no way describes the\n[CK] underlying repository actions.\n\nActually, the current WebDAV spec is a little confusing about\ncollections\nand their members. The current spec indicates collections contain URLs,\nnot\nresources. But, there is the notion of internal members and\nreferential\nmembers, and deleting a collection deletes all its internal members. So\nthe\ncollection behaves like it contains resources, not URLs. This issue\nwill\nlikely get more confusing when we add versioned resources, versioned\ncollections, and multiple revisions.\n\n[CK]Your right -- some clarification here would be could.\n\n3. It is not possible to automatically create workspaces or activities\nfor\neither non-versioning clients, or versioning clients that don't\nspecify\nthem. Default workspaces and/or activities must be used. Creating a\nnew\nworkspace or activity on each request could cause resources that were\nmanipulated in the previous request to disappear.\n\n[CK] If we say this is what \"logically\" happens on a Level 1 server\nthen\n[CK] OK.  But if the server must in fact do this, then I think the\ncost\n[CK] is too high since Level 1 clients don't care about this\ninformation.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10730703"}, {"subject": "Re: Branching Scenarios", "content": "Suppose we defined a DAV:branch property that can be assigned to an activity.\nThis is just a way for a client to say what \"branch\" they want products of\nthat activity to go on.  A server can just ignore this property, if it doesn't\nsupport or isn't interested in branches (e.g. a change-set system).\n\nLet's see how this plays out against Brad's scenarios:\n\n   From: Bradley_Sergeant@intersolv.com\n\n        Case 1: Version V1 of a product ZOO has reached its feature complete\n        milestone (FC), which for this project means it has all its intended\n        features, but still has bugs to be fixed.  At this point some\n        developers will continue fixing bugs in version V1, but others will\n        move on to work on the next version (V2).  The V1 code is on the\n        mainline.\n\nSo V1 activities had their DAV:branch property set to \"mainline\".\n\n        Because further changes to V1 are intended to be minimized\n        and the V2 work is a natural evolution of the V1 work, V2 work will\n        continue on the mainline.\n\nSo V2 activities will have their DAV:branch property set to \"mainline\".\n\n        Also, it is important that all bug fixes\n        for V1 also be immediately reflected in the V2 work.  So V1 bug fixes\n        also will be reflected on the mainline.  If a resource needs to be\n        changed for a V1 fix and it has already been fixed modified on the\n        mainline for V2, then the V1 change is made on a branch and also on\n        the mainline.  Otherwise, if no V2 changes have yet been made to the\n        resource the V1 change is only made on the mainline.  Thus the V2\n        version of ZOO is just the tip of the mainline, whereas the V1 version\n        must be obtained from a fixed configuration (via a fixed label, or\n        whatever mechanism is used) and this configuration must be updated\n        with each bug fix to V1.\n\nA simple approach is to just set the DAV:branch of V1 bug fix\nactivities to be \"V1-bug-fix\", and then require that all V1 bug fix\nactivites be merged to the mainline.  Then the RSR for V2 is just\n   LATEST(mainline)\nand the RSR for V1 is just\n   LATEST(V1-bug-fix) else V1-Config\n\nThis produces the effect you want, but isn't *identical* to the branching\nyou describe above.  To produce something identical, you could just add\nanother property, say DAV:secondary-branch.  Then you would set the\nDAV:branch of a V1 bug fix to be \"mainline\" and the DAV:secondary-branch\nto be \"V1-bug-fix\".  Your server would put things on the DAV:branch if it\ncould, and otherwise put it on the DAV:secondary-branch.  In this case,\nthe RSR for V1 is more complicated (to capture the changes you made on the\nmainline that are for V1).  Because of the resulting complication in the\nV1 RSR, I'd recommend the first approach, but that's up to the user/client.\n\n        Case 2: Version V1 of product ZOO has been released and version V2\n        development is well underway.  A key customer has contracted to have a\n        specific enhancement made to V1 specifically for them, the resulting\n        version is referred to as V1-A.  The V1-A enhancement is superseded by\n        different features that will be available with the V2 release, but the\n        customer does not wish to wait for V2 to complete.  All work on V1-A\n        will not be used in V2.  Therefore all V1-A changes are made on\n        branches newly created just for V1-A.\n\nJust set the DAV:branch property of V1-A activities to be the \"V1-A\".\n\n        I don't see how this can be done without some indication being given\n        as to which branching policy is desired for each Activity.\n\nAgreed.\n\n        Such an\n        indication could be in the form of a property on the Activity or an\n        option in the creation of the activity.\n\nWe've got a fine extensibility mechanism in the form of properties ...\nI say, use it.  What else would the \"option on creation\" map to?  You\ncould try to bundle all this into the \"resource-type\" property, but I\nsee no reason to do so.\n\n        Alternatively or in addition,\n        an administrator might specify which branching policies were allowed\n        for a set of resources. The indication of which policy to use could\n        be abstract and general, e.g. Principle vs. Supporting activity.  Or\n        the indication could be an implementation specific property.  A third\n        idea would be to see if a few specific types of activities could be\n        defined to meet known needs and leave the door open for adding new\n        ones later.\n\nI believe there are just two suggestions here: have this additional information\nstored in the resource-type, or store it in new properties.

Fine,\n   let's go with that for now.\n\n   Each V1 change will create a revision off the mainline on a new\n   branch.  Because the CASE 1 policy is that all V1 changes are\n   immediately reflected in V2 (the mainline) each consistent set of V1\n   changes needs to be merged back into the mainline.  This results in\n   lots of short branches merged immedately back to the mainline, usually\n   with no intervening revisions.\n\nIf there have been no changes on the mainline, then the merge is trivial\nand shoulc be automatic for even the most basic merge tools.  If there have\nbeen intervening changes on the mainline, then the human is stuck with a\nreal merge, whether they like it or not.\n\n        Further changes to V1 on a previously\n   V1 modified branch would require a subsequent merge onto the mainline.\n\nAgain, either the change is trivial and automatic if there have been no\nchanges to the mainline since the V1 branch was last merged, or there have\nbeen changes to the mainline, and the human is stuck with a real merge.\n\n   Subsequent merges like this build on previous merges and the user may\n   find himself remerging items, depending on the sophistication of the\n   merge tool and the willingness to trust previous human merge\n   operations.  This is unavoidable in the case where V2 changes have\n   occurred on the same resource.\n\nAgreed.\n\n        It is completely unnessary otherwise,\n   but the forced branch policy of activity V1 requires it.\n\nAs above, I even a simple-minded merge tool could detect that\nthere have been no changes since the last time the branch has been merged\n(just look at the predecessor and merge-predecessor relations),\nand therefore it can just automatically make a copy in this case\nwithout any human intervention.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10756710"}, {"subject": "Re: Branching Scenarios", "content": "   From: Bradley.Sergeant@merant.com\n\n   Now let's look at this without talking of branches.  Can the scenario\n   be described in a pure activity world.  Sure.  Case 1 says that all V1\n   activity changes are intended to be reflected immediately in the V2\n   activity (i.e. the mainline), but no V2 changes are to be seen by V1.\n   This is not imposible to describe.  It's just a characterization of\n   the intention of the activitiy.  Knowing this intention the server may\n   optimize or not.\n\nI think your original scenario phrased this better.  I.e. people working\non V2 want to make sure they get all the bug-fixes from V1.  No need\nto mention activity or branch mechanics in the scenario.  You'd probably\nwant to add \"and don't want to do any more merges than they absolutely\nhave to\", and you've probably captured the full scenario.\n\n   CASE1: TEE off mainline\n   An activity V1 intends all its changes to be reflected immediately in\n   the mainline, but no other mainline changes are to be seen by V1.\n\nI would be against this kind of phrasing of the scenario.  It is\nphrased in terms of CM mechanics, not user needs.\n\n   The CASE 2 scenario below is already covered in the Goals doc.\n\n   I believe there is a third common case we have not discuss so far.\n   I'll breifly outline it:\n\n   CASE 3: AutoMerge\n   Developers wish to work off the mainline, but in separate activities\n   so they are not blocked by others checking out the same resources.\n   However, all checkins are all intended for the mainline.  This may be\n   done by checking in to private activity and immedately merging to the\n   mainline, but subsequent checkouts are desired from the mainline and\n   not from the last checkout(checkin) of in the private activity.  This\n   is because of the desire to pickup the latest changes by others.\n\nHmmm.  This scenario seems a bit strange.  You can keep working on\nsomething as long as you as long as you don't check it in, but as soon as you\ncheck it in, you have to merge it with whatever else has been happening.\nWhat benefit is achieved by forcing people not to check-in until they\nare ready to merge?  (It just means they keep things checked-out longer).\n\n   NOTE: The builtin rule that last checked in revision superceeds the\n   revision selection rule in the workspace when selecting a revision\n   would seem to disallow a direct solution CASE 3 as workspace and\n   activity is currently defined.\n\nThe rule is \"products of the current activity\" take precedence.\nHow does this interfere with what you have in mind for case 3?\n(For a merge, you'd normally switch to a \"do-merge-xxx\" activity).\n\n   These are the only three types of activities I could come up with.\n   CASE 2 is clearly supported by Activities.  I believe the other two\n   cases may require some refinement of the model.  So please include\n   them as scenarios and we can work out the model and protocol to\n   support them as time goes on.  Ok?\n\nI'm happy with the first two (with the branch mechanics removed),\nbut I'd need to hear more about the third before being comfortable\nwith it as a scenario.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10761745"}, {"subject": "Re: Versioning goals doc input", "content": "I agree with each of Brad's points (especially the one of thanking Jim\nfor doing a great job on the goals document!).

I meant to say that (3.1) corresponds to your scenario 1.\n\n   I don't quite see it easily\n   emerging from 3 or 3.1 so I'll call it 4 for now.  The basic idea was\n   the continuance of an existing line of development for future work and\n   the creation of a dead-end activity for limited changes to a release\n   (patches), while merging all changes into the continuing development\n   as well.\n\nMy scenario (3.1) was intended to capture this situation.

All\n   changes made in or merged into P1R1 are also merged into the P1\n   workspace.\n\nIn my scenario, I didn't create a new project name or workspace for\nP1R1, but just kept calling them P1.  So if in scenario (3.1) you\nrename the workspace Workspace-P1 to be Workspace-P1R1 immediately\nafter the configuration R1 is created, then I believe scenario (3.1)\nand (4) are equivalent.  If doing this rename makes the scenario clearer\n(and I can see how it might), then I'm all for it.\n\n   (4.1) A branch-based system is used. P developers are required to work\n   on the same branch (the DAV:branch property of all P1 activities are\n   set to be \"branch-P1\").  P1R1 developers use the branch-P1 if\n   possible, otherwise use the \"branch-P1R1\" (by setting the DAV:branch\n   property of P1R1 activities to branch-P1 and the DAV:secondaryBranch\n   property to branch-P1R1).  This way only P1R1 changes that occur on\n   resources already modified by P1 activities go on the branch-P1R1.\n\nYup, that works for me.  So let's number this scenario \"3.2\".\n(I've added it to the scenario document I've started ... I'll hand\nit over to Jim as soon as it settles down).\n\n   Geoffrey, from the point of view of the branching system no merge is\n   required for P1R1 changes that go on the branch-P1.  In your current\n   protocol proposal would a merge be required in order to update the P1\n   workspace to see the P1R1 changes that were made on the branch-P1?\n\nThe protocol doesn't currently define a MERGE method (I was going to\nwait until we had agreement on the workspace and activity concepts),\nbut looking ahead, yes, I believe the protocol should provide a\nMERGE-ACTIVITY method.  The actual implementation of the MERGE-ACTIVITY\nmethod would then be up to the server, and would vary depending on\nwhether the server is branch-based, change-based, or whatever.\n\n   Or will the RSR of the P1 workspace make this unneeded?  I'm thinking a\n   merge may be required, but might not result in any change to the\n   revision histories of the versioned resources.\n\nYes, if the DAV:branch of the activity being merged is\ncurrently specified in the RSR of the destination workspace, then the\nserver knows that no resource merges are required to achieve the\nactivity merge (it was effectively done as soon as the new revisions\nwere checked-in).  If the activity has a DAV:secondary-branch, then the\nserver would have to do a merge from that secondary-branch, if it\nexists on a versioned resource.\n\n   This would be because\n   a preexisting P1 activity had previous checked in an ancestor of a\n   resource modified on branch-P1 by a P1R1 activity and the built-in\n   activity RSR rule #2 would cause an earlier revision to be selected.\n\nAha!  Now I see the concern you expressed earlier about having the\nDAV:activity be built-in high priority rule.  It would have to be an\n\"and\" rule (i.e. let later rules extend the revision selected to a\ndescendent), but many servers only support \"or\" rules (i.e. if you\nfind a match in that rule, don't look at any more rules).\n\nJimA: I believe this means we should remove the second built-in rule,\nwhich means that the only built-in rule is that the working resources\nin a workspace take precedence over the revision selection rules\n(that's a built-in rule I'm sure of :-).  (Jim, we'll probably need\nto discuss this on the phone).\n\n   Sorry for the convolution.  I'm trying to understand the implications\n   of the proposed protocol on branching systems.

However, in spite of all these functions, client applications\noften want more. For example, a typical document management application\nmight do document life cycle management functions like review and approval\ncycles, document states and transitions, rendering variants in multiple\ndocument formats, workflow and groupware functions, notification,\npublishing, etc. These client applications can exploit new resource types\nand WebDAV properties to implement these functions, but unless multiple\nclient applications implement them the same way, interoperability is\ncompromised.

So how do we support new functions, promote\ninteroperability, and keep the protocol domain neutral and simple?\n\nOne approach is to take a lesson from XML. XML is a standard language for\ntagged documents. The standard specifies (among other things) that an XML\ndocument contains elements which have attributes and can contain other\nelements. So XML, unlike HTML, defines a standard syntax for documents, but\nnot a standard for their specific content structure. A class of documents\ncan be described using a Document Type Definition (DTD) that specifies the\nvalid element structure for that class of documents.  A DTD defines a\n\"document language\" that can be used to describe and validate documents\nthat conform to that language. Interested industries can get together and\ndefine a document language for their industry. Then applications\ninteroperate at two levels: one using XML documents as a common interchange\nformat, and another using agreed upon DTDs to describe the structure of\nthese documents. XML doesn't have to change to support Health Care or the\nAutomotive Industry, those industries just have to agree on their\nrespective DTDs. There are standards efforts underway to facilitate the\nconstruction of these DTDs. For example:\n\n  - CDF  for push applications\n  - CIM2  for systems and network management apps\n  - EAD  for apps which need access to archival inventories and registers\n  - HTML4  for Web documents\n  - MathML for mathematics\n  - OAG  for supply chain applications\n  - OTP  for eCommerce applications\n  - PGML  for graphics\n  - RosettaNet  their catalog DTD for use in eCommerce\n  - SMIL  for streaming media apps\n  - vCard  for applications needing to process an electronic business card\n  - WML - for transcoding applications to wireless PvC devices\n  - iCal  - for calendar and calendar-related events\n\nThere are also web sites that provide a repository for DTDs so that\ninterested parties can see what other people are doing in the same domain,\nand can locate potential collaborators. See http://www.schema.net.\n\nWe could do something similar for client extensions to WebDAV based on\nresource types and properties. This could be facilitated by establishing a\nweb site that WebDAV client developers could visit and contribute to that\nwould contain proposals for properties and resource document types to\nsupport particular domains. For example, one could envision a consortium of\ndocument management providers who would collaborate on resource types and\nproperties to support document life cycle management as described above.\nThis would allow client providers to establish standards without extending\nthe WebDAV protocol for particular domains of interest while still enabling\ninteroperability. Client applications could continue to add value of their\nown, but could expect that documents conforming to the standard would have\nexpected properties and structure.\n\nI propose that we establish such a web site, and that the WebDAV working\ngroups may want to exploit this concept themselves instead of adding a lot\nof DAV properties to the standard that may prove to be too domain specific\nfor general reuse, or result in too may server options for clients to be\neffectively written.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10832405"}, {"subject": "Re: Standard WebDAV Properties", "content": "   From: \"Roy T.

(Or maybe you just disagree :-).\n\nThere are two very different ways of achieving interoperability.\n\nYou can add new HTTP methods, headers, and resource types.  You then\nneed to describe the interaction between the new methods and headers\nwith and all existing resource types, and then the interaction between\nthe new resource types and all methods (both old and new).\n\nGiven that HTTP methods and headers are a flat name space and a\nserver needs to respond to any method/header combination applied\nto any resource type, it is essential that the number of new ones\nintroduced be draconianly minimized.\n\nBut another way to achieve interoperability is to agree upon how a\nparticular property name will be used, and a DTD for the value of that\nproperty.  Unfortunately, if you take your earlier statement literally,\nthen this agreement is a \"protocol change\", and groups interested\nin this kind of interoperability feel the need to get their property\nnames and DTD's \"into the protocol\".\n\nWhat Jim is proposing is that this is a *different* kind, but equally\nvalid form of interoperability, and because it requires no new\nmethods, headers, or resource types, it does *not* have to be addressed\nby the protocol working group, but rather more informally by posting\nto a web site or some means other than a formal IETF working group.\n\nSo Jim's proposal is actually designed to *limit* the work/scope of a\nworking group (and as a member of the versioning design team, that is\na goal I vigorously support :-).\n\n   Semantics-by-reference is a very common technique (we had the same discussio\nn\n   at the Dublin Metadata Conference regarding schemas).  I wasn't disagreeing\n   with Jim's suggestion, except to note that\n\n     1) XML is nothing special in that regard, and\n\nIt's not special, but we're already requiring an XML parser to handle\nWebDAV properties, so why make people use two (or n) parsers, when an\nXML parser would work just fine.  It's just a parser, after all.\n\n     2) the IETF doesn't do that, and\n\nThat's Jim's point.  While people think that \"if it's an interoperability\nissue, it must be addressed by an IETF working group\", we get constant\npressure to deal with issues that we believe could be handled more\ninformally.  Lisa's structured document property proposal is an excellent\nexample.\n\n     3) HTTP doesn't need it if the application is done right.\n\n   The HTTP approach, when used wisely, is to construct a set of resources\n   that represent the application, and then use standard methods on those\n   resources.\n\nI heartily agree.\n\n   My reading of Jim's message was that it was a criticism of\n   the direction of WebDAV versioning, which I would agree with, but\n   his suggested solution is entirely different than mine.  This doesn't\n   change the fact that it is a good idea to have such a DTD library.\n\nI'm *very* interested in hearing your criticism of the direction\nof WebDAV versioning (781-676-2684 if you think it would be more\neffective by phone).  I personally believe there were way too many\nheaders and methods being proposed, and not enough use of new resource\ntypes and standard properties for them.  In draft-clemm-webdav-versioning\nI propose just one new header (Workspace) and 6 new methods:\nCONTROL, CHECKOUT, CHECKIN, UNCHECKOUT, GETCONFLICTS, UPDATE.\nWe are currently working hard to unify this proposal with\ndraft-ietf-webdav-versioning.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10839251"}, {"subject": "IETF Versioning Meetings", "content": "As agreed on the teleconference today, we will have a WebDAV versioning\nworking group meeting on Wed and Thu, March 17 and 18 at IETF 44.

Let me know if you think there's something missing.\n\nLet's set aside some time in next week's call to review presentation\nmaterial outlines. Chris, is this OK with you?\n\nWebDAV Versioning Summary\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the WebDAV semantics for supporting\nversioning, parallel development, and configuration management. This\nsummary does not describe the details of the protocol, only the high level\nsemantics the protocol is intended to support.\n\nCreating Versioned Resources\n\nA resource or collection can be put under version control. Putting a\nresource under version control creates a versioned resource and sets its\ninitial revision to the resource. A checked in revision cannot be modified\nby anyone at any time.\n\nNaming Revisions: revision ids and labels\n\nA revision of a versioned resource is given a system assigned revision id\nwhen it is checked in. This revision id acts as an immutable identifier\ndistinguishing this revision from all others of the same versioned\nresource. A revision id can be assigned to only one revision of a versioned\nresource, and can never be reused on that versioned resource.\n\nA user may assign other revision names called revision labels to a revision\nin order to distinguish it from other revisions using more meaningful\nnames. These revision labels must be unique for any given versioned\nresource, but may be reassigned to any revision of the versioned resource\nat any time. Revisions of different versioned resources may have the same\nlabel. There is a distinguished, floating label called \"latest\" which\nalways refers to the latest revision in a given activity.\n\nModifying a Versioned Resource\n\nA versioned resource may be modified by checking out a revision to create a\nworking resource. A working resource can be updated (PUT, PROPPATCH, etc.)\nany number of times. When updates are complete, the working resource is\nchecked back in. Users can use checkout/checkin to register intent to\nmodify a versioned resource similar to the way lock and unlock are used in\nDAV level 2. The sense is reversed though. A checked in revision cannot be\nchanged without checking it out first.\n\nA revision may be checked in as mutable or immutable. If the revision is\nmutable, a subsequent checkin of a working resource may be done in place\nallowing the mutable revision to be updated in place without creating a new\nrevision. Any previous contents of the revision are lost. A working\nresource created by a checkout of a mutable revision can also be checked\nback in creating a new revision if the user wants to retain the previous\nrevision. If the revision is immutable, any checkin of a working resource\nderived from this revision must create a new revision. The mutability of a\nrevision cannot be changed once it has been established on an initial\ncheckin.\n\nServers may choose to not allow revisions to be checked in as mutable, or\nthey may not allow a revision to be checked in without creating a new\nrevision. These constraints are typical of current configuration management\nsystems. Document management systems typically allow revisions to be\nmutable and don't have these restrictions.\n\nA revision of a collection is modified by adding or removing members.\nChanging the contents of a member of a revision of a versioned collection\ndoes not imply a change to the parent collection.\n\nParallel Development with Activities\n\nResources are checked out in the context of an activity. An activity\nabstracts a set of related changes a user is making to versioned resources.\nEach activity represents a parallel thread of development. Servers that\ndon't support parallel development effectively only support one, default\nactivity. A revision that is already checked out in an activity cannot be\nchecked out again in the same activity. If parallel development is desired,\na user can checkout the revision in another activity and merge them later.\n\nSelecting Revision through the Workspace\n\nResources, working resources, and revisions of versioned resources are all\naccessed using a URL. Specific revisions of a versioned resource can be\naccessed by specifying the resource URL and a version label. However,\nversioned resources are usually accessed using a simple URL. The revision\nselected when a specific revision name is not specified is resolved through\na workspace. A workspace provides a mapping between URLs for versioned\nresources, and specific revisions. This allows versioned resources and\nunversioned resources to be accessed the same way supporting relative ULRs\nand DAV level-2 clients that are not versioning aware.\n\nA workspace contains a current activity and a revision selection rule.\nRevisions are selected using the following rules in order: 1) if there is a\nchecked out revision, then it is selected. else 2) if there is a revision\nthat is checked in under the current activity, then the latest revision in\nthis activity is selected, else 3) the workspace revision selection rule is\napplied to select the revision. If there is no matching revision, then a\nresource not found status is returned. This rule is applied to collections\nto select the revision that determines their member versioned resources,\nand to other resource to determine the revision containing their contents.\n\nA workspace revision selection rule can specify any number of revision\nlabels, activities, configurations, or the functor \"latest\" to specify what\nrevision to select. The rules are applied in order until the first matching\nis found. Any subsequent potential matches are ignored. A label matches a\nrevision with that label. An activity matches the latest revision in that\nactivity, and may result in merge conflicts. A configuration matches a\nrevision contained in that configuration. Latest matches the latest\nrevision. The first two rules above are just implied components of the\nworkspace revision selection rule. They are called out separately as they\nare fixed by the server.\n\nIf a request is made and no workspace is specified, a default workspace\ncontaining activity named \"mainline\", and \"latest\" in the version selection\nrule is used. Administrators can change the current activity and revision\nselection rule of this default workspace to have such down-level client\nrequests done in some other activity, or to support access to more specific\nrevisions of versioned resources.\n\nConfiguration Management\n\nA workspace represents a volatile set of revisions. Any new checkouts,\nchanges to the current activity, merging operations, or changes to the\nrevision selection rule may result in the selection of different revisions.\nA configuration is a resource that represents an immutable set of\nrevisions. A configuration contains a specific revision of each member\nversioned resource. A configuration cannot contain a mutable revision\nbecause the semantics of configurations cannot be guaranteed. A workspace\nwhose version selection rule contains a configuration will always return\nthe same revisions as long as there are no revisions checked out and\nnothing in the current activity.\n\nVersioned Collections\n\nA collection contains a set of members. For versioned collections, the\nmembers are versioned resources, not particular revisions. To add or remove\nmembers from a revision of a versioned collection, it must be checked out\njust like any other resource. Creating a new revision of a member, or\nmodifying a member has no effect on the collection. Deleting a versioned\nresource that is an internal member from a collection does not delete the\nversioned resource, it only deletes the member from that version of the\ncollection. The resource may still be a member of a previous or subsequent\nrevision of this or some other collection. The URL for a collection without\na particular revision name is resolved to a particular revision using the\nworkspace the same as any other resource. If the collection is part of a\nURL for some other resource, then its members are determined from the\nselected revision.\n\nRevision History\n\nEach revision has a predecessor relationship with the revision it was\nchecked out or merged from, and a successor relationship with revisions\nthat were checked out from it. The revision history of a versioned resource\nis the tree made up of all its revisions from the initial revision to all\ntip revisions in all activities in which this versioned resource was\nmodified.\n\nMerging\n\nEach activity represents a separate parallel thread of development. Users\nmake their changes in the context of an activity. Changes to the same\nrevision must be done in separate activities. At some point, a user may\nwant to merge changes made to the same revision together to create a new\nrevision containing the combined updates. This is accomplished by merging\nan activity into a workspace. In order to do a merge, it is first necessary\nto determine what must be merged. A merge conflict report lists the\nresources that have been modified in parallel in different activities. The\nmerge conflict report is generated using the following rules: 1) if the\nmerge source specifies a predecessor of the revision selected by the\nworkspace, then the workspace revision is selected, else 2) if the merge\nsource specifies a successor of the revision selected by the workspace,\nthen the merge source revision is selected, else 3) the merge source and\nthe current workspace specify revisions that are on different\nlines-of-descent, and a potential merge conflict exists and is included in\nthe merge conflict report.\n\nA user can request the differences between two revisions of a resource\n(servers may provide a differences report, but they must at least indicate\nif they are the same or not). A user can request conflicts between an\nactivity and the current workspace to generate a merge conflict report. A\nuser can also request the differences between a configuration and the\ncurrent workspace which lists at least the activities that are contained in\nthe configuration but not in the workspace and vice versa. So differences\nare detected at different levels: content differences for resources,\nrevision differences for activities, and activity differences for\nconfigurations.\n\nOnce the merge conflicts are known, a user resolves the conflicts by\nmerging the source activity with the workspace. This enters the merge\nsource into the workspace, and sets the current conflicts that must be\nresolved. The conflicts are resolved by merging the revisions from the\nmerge source into the revision selected by the workspace to create a new\nworking resource. Servers may perform some default auto merging, but at a\nminimum, the merge is done by checking out the revision in the current\nactivity and noting the merge from the merge source. This creates an\nadditional successor/predecessor relationship between the merge source and\nworkspace revisions called merged-from. The conflict is now removed because\nthe working resource is now a successor of both the source and target\nrevisions. It is the user's responsibility to apply the differences in the\ntwo revisions in an appropriate manner. The merge is complete when all the\nconflicts are resolved, all differences have been merged, and the resources\nare all checked back in. The merge source can now be removed from the\nworkspace as all of its changes are now included in the current activity.\nOnly one activity can be merged at a time.\n\nWhen merging mutable revisions, the merge conflict report may be inaccurate\nas the source revision may change without the system being aware. Users are\nresponsible for applying any changes to ancestor revisions to their\ndescendants as appropriate. The system cannot determine if there are any\nchanges that need to be applied other than by looking a the last-modified\ndates of the revisions.\n\nLocking Versioned Resources\n\nLocking a versioned resource prevents any revision from being checked out\nin any activity. Locking a revision of a versioned resource prevents just\nthat revision from being checked out in any activity. Locking an activity\nprevents any revisions from being checked out in that activity. Locking a\nworkspace prevents any checkouts in the current activity of that workspace\n(similar to locking the current activity), and prevents changes to the\nworkspace revision selection rule.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10845896"}, {"subject": "Re: IETF Versioning Meetings", "content": "Jim,\n\nThank you for the summary. I have inter-leaved some questions/issues. I hope\nthis is not too late to raise the issues and I also hope that the issues are\nmore because of my mis-understanding rather than some thing missing in the\nsemantics being proposed.\n\n\n>A revision of a collection is modified by adding or removing members.\n>Changing the contents of a member of a revision of a versioned collection\n>does not imply a change to the parent collection.\n\n\nI may be confused about what you are trying to say, however, I wonder if\nthis assumption is too strong for dependency analysis. If a programmer is\nwriting code (file A) that is dependent on the specification of the program\n(file B) and if both of these are being kept together as a semantically\nmeaningful collection, then modifying file B or A does impact the semantic\nconsistency of the collection. Does this make sense?\n\n>Parallel Development with Activities\n\n>Resources are checked out in the context of an activity. An activity\n>abstracts a set of related changes a user is making to versioned resources.\n>Each activity represents a parallel thread of development. Servers that\n>don't support parallel development effectively only support one, default\n>activity.\n\nAre nesting of activities allowed? If not this model is too restrictive for\nweb site development and deployment. Furthermore, if nested activities are\nallowed then are 'continuation' of activities after intermeidate submissions\nare made allowed?\n\nThere are two fundamental notions here. Change and compound change. It\nsounds like your description covers the 'change' concept, it does not cover\nthe 'compound change'.\n\n>A workspace contains a current activity and a revision selection rule.\n\nI don't understand the semantics of 'contained'. The way I think about it\neach activity is associated with a workspace and each workspace has\nselection rules. Am I missing something.\n\n>Revisions are selected using the following rules in order: 1) if there is a\n>checked out revision, then it is selected. else 2) if there is a revision\n>that is checked in under the current activity, then the latest revision in\n>this activity is selected, else 3) the workspace revision selection rule is\n>applied to select the revision. If there is no matching revision, then a\n>resource not found status is returned. This rule is applied to collections\n>to select the revision that determines their member versioned resources,\n>and to other resource to determine the revision containing their contents.\n\n\nCould you provide some rationale for why the ordering? I am confused. I\nwould think that the simplest case (and hence the default case) would be to\nallow users to checkout named (and not labeled) revisions in the context of\na workspace and there is no 'view rule' processing required. Don't you\nthinking processing of view rules should be followed after this.

In particular:\n\n   - Reliable Configurations\n\n   A configuration is an immutable snapshot of a subtree of a website.\n   The concept of a configuration must co-exist with the need to allow\n   clients to modify the binding of a \"user URL\" to a new resource via\n   a MOVE.\n\n   This could be achieved by requiring that the server assign a\n   \"locatable URN\" to each versioned resource, independent\n   of the \"user URL\" that is subject to a MOVE.\n   A configuration would be defined in terms of a set of \"locatable URN\"s,\n\n   - Merging Configurations\n\n   In order to reliably merge configurations, it is essential to know\n   whether two different revisions of the \"same\" versioned resource\n   appear in the two configurations, since this implies a \"merge\" of\n   those revisions is needed.  The \"user URL\"s of the two revisions are\n   not sufficient, because one or more MOVE's could have renamed the\n   revisions.  This could be achieved by providing a \"VR-URN\" property of\n   a revision, containing the \"locatable URN\" for that revision's versioned\n   resource.  The versioned resource must be \"locatable\" because the\n   revision history must be accessible in order to support the merge\n   process (e.g. finding the nearest common ancestor revision).\n\n   - Non-local Workspaces\n\n   Many versioning systems maintain a workspace on a host separate from\n   where the versioning resources are stored (e.g. on the client or on a\n   different web-server).  To support this, a server must provide some way\n   of reliably referencing a particular versioned-resource.  A locatable\n   URN would support this requirement.\n\nDave pointed out that a \"locatable URN\" is currently at best a\n\"work-in-progress\".\n\nBrad pointed out that a URN wrt some identified \"repository\" resource\nis feasible, and is what is actually supported today by versioning and\ndocument management systems.\n\nGeoff agreed with both of these points, and volunteered to write up\na proposal that addresses these use cases with a \"repository resource\"\ninstead of a \"locatable URN\".\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-10897014"}, {"subject": "Re: IETF Versioning Meetings", "content": "   From: \"Sankar Virdhagriswaran\" <sv@crystaliz.com>\n\n   >A revision of a collection is modified by adding or removing members.\n   >Changing the contents of a member of a revision of a versioned collection\n   >does not imply a change to the parent collection.\n\n   I may be confused about what you are trying to say, however, I wonder if\n   this assumption is too strong for dependency analysis. If a programmer is\n   writing code (file A) that is dependent on the specification of the program\n   (file B) and if both of these are being kept together as a semantically\n   meaningful collection, then modifying file B or A does impact the semantic\n   consistency of the collection. Does this make sense?\n\nThere are two \"levels\" of collection versioning.  The first \"base level\"\nis the one Jim describes, i.e. a collection is changed (and therefore\nrequires to be checked-out) only if you are adding or deleting an\nimmediate (level 1) member of the collection.\n\nIf you care about the revision selection choices in a tree rooted at a\nparticular collection, you would capture the revision state of all\nmembers of that tree in a \"configuration\".  If any revision selection\nchanged for any member, this would be reflected in a new\nconfiguration.  If you version configurations (which I believe you\nshould), then you use revisions of a configuration to capture the\nevolution of that tree.\n\n   >Parallel Development with Activities\n\n   >Resources are checked out in the context of an activity.

If not this model is too restrictive for\n   web site development and deployment.

The way I think about it\n   each activity is associated with a workspace and each workspace has\n   selection rules. Am I missing something.\n\nI think you've got it.  The word \"contains\" should probaby be changed,\nsince it sounds like collection membership, which is not the case.\nNote that only (at most) one activity will be the current activity of\na workspace at any moment (that's the one that new checkout's will go\ninto), so at a single moment most activities will not be the current\nactivity of a workspace (although if they have any revisions, they\nmust have been the current activity of some workspace at some point).\n\n   >Revisions are selected using the following rules in order: 1) if there is a\n   >checked out revision, then it is selected. else 2) if there is a revision\n   >that is checked in under the current activity, then the latest revision in\n   >this activity is selected, else 3) the workspace revision selection rule is\n   >applied to select the revision.

I am confused. I\n   would think that the simplest case (and hence the default case) would be to\n   allow users to checkout named (and not labeled) revisions in the context of\n   a workspace and there is no 'view rule' processing required. Don't you\n   thinking processing of view rules should be followed after this. Maybe that\n   is what you are saying, but just wanted to make sure.\n\nWe have agreed to get rid of rule (2), so that just leaves:\n\"checked-out else whatever the revision-selection-rule picks\".\nDoes this correspond better to your intuition?  (It's what I'd\nlike for us to say, anyway).  Some people are going even further\nand saying that \"a workspace doesn't even have to select the working\nresources checked out into it, that's just one of the possible\nrevision-selection rules\".

However, it does\nnot stop me from trying ;-). The general idea is to have a set of conditions\nthat need to be met before a 'change' can be successfully applied (change\nand compound change are the same from this perspective). The conditions\nassert states in which items need to be for success. Different policy\nmechanisms can then be implemented to resolve conflicts that arise when a\nchange is applied. The kind of dependency that I described in the example is\none 'policy' that makes sure that 'read-write' conflicts are captured by the\nsystem. In parallel development with nested activities, this sort of\ndependency becomes key to manage. There are other policies that one could\nthink of.

The semantic affect\nof nested activities would be that if a parent-activity is specified\nin a revision-selection-rule, all child activities of that activity\nare implicitly selected as well.  This doesn't require any additional\nprotocol support.\n\n   How do <revision> selection\n   rules interact with the proposal for URNs.\n\nFor simple revision-selection-rules (like activity, label, and\nconfiguration based rules), there is no interaction (versioned resource\nURL's or URN's do not appear in the rules).\n\nThere are some \"scoped\" revision-selection-rules that some servers\ncurrently support, that apply a given rule clause to only a subset\nof the versioned-resources.  This scoping could be in terms of the\nproposed URN's or in terms of the URL's, or both.  It is likely that\nwe won't define these scoped rsr clauses in the first draft of the\nspec, but a server is free to make this kind of extension.\n\n   The reason I ask is again to see if the model I have in my mind will work.

From a cursory\n   understanding of the proposal for URNs that was recently sent out, I thought\n   it allowed for user selection based on 'names'. Am I hoplessly confused?\n\nRather than talk about URL's and URN's, let's talk about types of resources.\nThere is a versioned-resource.  This is what you get after you put\na versionable resource under version control.  For versioning systems\nthat support a \"repository\" for versioned resource history, the\nversioned-resource is actually just a special kind of reference to a\n\"history resource\" (that stores all the revisions etc. for that versioned\nresource).\n\nThe versioned-resource always has a URL.  I have proposed that the\nhistory resource have a URN.  My initial proposal was that these history\nresource URN's be \"locatable\".  After the Monday discussion, I have agreed\nto try to revise that to say \"if you have a handle (e.g. a URL to)\na \"repository\", you can map that URN into a real resource\".  (I haven't\nhad a chance to write that up yet).\n\nSo although you can get any revision from a history resource (by looking\nat certain properties), the normal way of getting a revision is to take\nthe URL of a versioned resource, and specify a \"Version-Name\" or\n\"Workspace\" header if you want anything other than the \"default\" revision.\n\n   >I believe the answer is \"yes\", but if you have a dependency conflict model\n   >in mind, please send it in for consideration.

Jim Amsden chaired\nthe meeting, with Jim Whitehead recording notes.  Approximately 65 people\nwere in attendance.\n\nThe meeting began with a presentation by Jim Amsden on the proposed charter\nfor the DELTA-V working group (charters were handed out to all attendees\nbefore the start of the meeting).  Jim Amsden noted that work has been going\non within WebDAV, in a subgroup, and they have determined that the area is\nsufficiently complex to warrant the creation of a new working group, and are\nholding this BOF to judge the level of interest in the topic.\n\nDuring the presentation, questions were asked about the item in the charter\nstating that development of a server-to-server protocol is out of scope.\nThese questions asked whether not having a server to server protocol would\nmake it impossible to support configurations which cross servers.  The\nconcern was that cross-server configurations would lead inevitably to a\nserver-to-server protocol.  Jim Amsden replied that the design group\nbelieves it's possible to handle this case without going down a slippery\nslope to a server-to-server protocol.  But, he noted that it's a\npossibility, and the design team will be alert for this.\n\nAnother question concerned why a versioning and configuration management\nprotocol was being built on top of HTTP, and why was HTTP being used for\nauthoring.  Jim Amsden replied that this work was extending WebDAV, which\ninitially extended HTTP for authoring because HTTP, and other protocols such\nas FTP, are insufficient for collaborative authoring of Web resources.\n\nJacob Palme next put up a handwritten slide showing annotations on versioned\nresources, and asked whether DELTA-V was considering supporting this kind of\ncapability.  Jim Amsden stated that while DELTA-V was not planning on\naddressing annotation support, he felt that (other than the versioning\naspects) this capability could be implemented using capabilities of the\nWebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol (RFC 2518).\n\nThis was followed by a discussion of version histories which span multiple\nservers.  Yaron Goland felt very strongly that a versioned resource must be\nable to start on one server and end on another server.  He noted that the\nWebDAV Distributed Authoring Protocol tried very hard to make sure that if,\nin the future, there were federated servers, the protocol wouldn't make this\nimpossible.  After some discussion on this issue, it appeared that, while\nthe initial Web versioning and configuration management protocol wouldn't\nallow for the creation and manipulation of cross-server version histories,\nthere was some agreement to  work hard to make sure it's possible to express\ncross-server version histories.\n\nThere was a brief discussion on whether properties are versioned.  In the\ncurrent design, properties are part of a resource, and are versioned with\nit.  However, some properties are mutable (for example, access control\nproperties), and can be modified without causing a new revision to be made.\n\nAnother question was asked: will all clients have to know about all the\nconfiguration management capabilities in order to perform simple versioning\noperations?  The answer was no, there will be either 2 or 3 levels of\nversioning capability, with simple versioning being at level 1.\n\nAt the end of the discussion period, Jim Amsden asked for a show of hands\nfor people who thought the IETF should have a working group in this area,\nand appx. 25-30 people raised their hands.  When the attendees were asked to\nvoice any objections they had to such a working gorup being formed, nobody\nmade any comments.\n\nChris Kaler next gave a presentation on the concepts, data model, and goals\nfor the Web versioning and configuration management protocol, as developed\nby the subgroup of WebDAV that has been actively working on this problem.\n\nA question was raised on the levels of versioning and configuration\nmanagement support. The questioner noted that the current design has a\nnumber of discrete states of versioning support, and posited that it is\nlikely that some clients or some servers might not be at exactly one of\nthose points.  Chris Kaler agreed with this observation, and noted that each\nlevel can be viewed as a minimum set of capabilities supported by an\napplication, and an application might support more capabilities than they\nare advertising.\n\nA clarification question was asked: when you check-out a resource, is this a\nshared or exclusive checkout?  Chris replied that in advanced versioning, a\ncheckout can be shared.\n\nMark Day noted that in previous discussions on this topic within WebDAV,\nthere had been an issue of whether revisions were mutable or immutable.\nChris noted that if there are mutable properties, then a \"immutable\"\nrevision might change if its mutable properties have been changed.  There is\nalso the document management style mutability, where a checked-in revision\nmight possibly be changed.\n\nThere was some discussion on the topic of activities, which clarified the\nconcept for attendees.  One question asked whether an activity is a change\npackage, to which Brad Sergeant replied that an activity is not a change\npackage, or a change set for that matter.\nThere was discussion on the definition of an activity, and some scenarios of\nuse.  An audience member noted that an activity makes sense for the\nsemantics of a merge operation, and Jim Amsden replied that activities will\ndefinitely be needed for merging together parallel changes.\n\nAn attendee asked if a revision is a delta between two objects?  Chris\nreplied, stating that a revision is a specific state of an item, not a\ndelta.\n\nAn attendee noted that a configuration is defined in terms of revisions, not\nin terms of URLs, and wondered if this was correct. Chris replied, \"Yes and\nno.  It is a collection of revisions, but each revision has a unique URL.\"\n\nA clarification question was asked: the existence of workspaces implies that\nyou can handle multiple lines of development. Chris stated that this was\ncorrect.\n\nAnother question asked, whether there was an assumption that there is a\ncentral database and there is a view of this? Chris replied that the design\ngroup is assuming that a server implementation would use a database.\n\nAn attendee asked, can I version my workspace to create a configuration?\nJim Amsden replied that you don't version a workspace.  Jim stated that a\nconfiguration is a versionable resource, although this assertion caused some\ndissention among the design team.\n\nThe question was raised, why should a workspace be a server-side item? Why\nshouldn't the client take care of this? Chris replied that a workspace needs\nto be on the server for URL management, as well as for interoperability.\nPlus, when workspaces are on the server, a person can start work with one\nclient at the office, then go home and use a separate client and still get\nwork done.\n\nThere was a brief discussion on the complexity of revision selection rules\n(RSRs).  Yaron Goland noted that RSRs sound very complex, and could perhap\nlead to the development of a Turing complete scripting language.  There was\nagreement on the existence of this \"slippery slope\",  tempered by a belief\namong the design group that RSRs can be kept very simple, without the need\nfor scripting facilities.  There was a suggestion that the DASL query\nlanguage could perhaps be used for RSR definition.\n\nThe question was raised, can a team share a workspace? Chris replied that\nthe design group is viewing workspaces as belonging to individuals, not\nteams.  But, you could create a master, then make multiple copies of the\nworkspace.  This was followed by some discussion over how to support shared\nteam development within a workspace.  It was noted that there can be\nmultiple activities per workspace.\n\nDuring the discussion of workspaces, it was noted that if you want to copy\nthem, then share them, etc., workspaces are starting to sound like they\nshould be versioned.  Chris replied that it might be possible, but the\ndesign gorup wishes to avoid the circularity of having to use versioned\nresources to control operations on other versioned resources. An attendeed\nnoted, however, \"this doesn't sound so hard to me.  I've used a system where\na workspace is a versioned resource, and it works quite well.\"  Chris stated\nthat the design group should go consider this issue again.\n\nChris next presents scenarios for versioning, which do not elicit any\nquesions. He then proceeds to slides on the goals, and then non-goals slide,\nwhich has history across servers listed as a non-goal.\n\nYaron Goland stated that he is concerned that some operations on revision\nhistories, such as moving a label, might cause problems for version\nhistories which span servers. Jim Whitehead noted that there are approaches\nthat can address this, such as making labels a pair of a human readable\nstring plus a GUID. Chris Kaler noted that the design group definitely needs\nto give this some thought and support version histories that are in a\ndistributed environment.  Yaron stated that he would be happy with language\nthat stated that this functionality won't be explicitly supported, but that\ndistributed version graphs should be possible to express.  Chris stated that\nthe design group will consider this. Since supporting this goal may lead to\ndesign choices we don't want to make, I don't want to commit to supporting\nthis right now.  Jim Amsden noted that IBM researched cross-repository\nversioning for a long time, and the issue is very difficult.\n\nThere was a brief discussion, including some use scenarios, on\nconfigurations, trying to clarify the participant's understanding of\nconfigurations.  This was followed by a similar discussion of merging.\n\nThe question was asked whether is it possible for configurations to\nreference other configurations?  Chris noted that the design gorup has been\ntalking about this feature, and returned the question: \"what you you think\nthe right answer is?\"  There were several voiecs among the attendees who\nagreed with the assertion that configurations should be able to refer to\nother configuration.  This was supported by a brief scenario where the same\nobjects are shared across organizational boundaries (a graphics department\nmakes graphics, and parking department uses them) within an organization.\nChris noted that the design group will need to consider this issue more in\nlight of this feedback.\n\nThere was some discussion on merging.  One participant noted that it might\nbe very valuable to not have merging be a very strict operation, and allow\npeople to perform a later merge operation.  It might be too strict to force\npeople to merge all resources right away, or all during a merge operation,\nbefore other activities can take place.  This was followed by some\ndiscussion trying to refine the question, and some belief by the design team\nthat this capability is already supported.

So labels\nare primarily there for core versioning servers that don't want\nto implement baselines.\n\nNote that your server can do what it wants, e.g. expose the DAV:version-name\nas a label, and fail all explicit client attempts to use the LABEL method.\nThe only interoperability cost that you would incur would be that\na client would then not be able to label against your server.  But\nit would be able to checkout/checkin and all the other usual core\nversioning things.  \n\n   Section 11.2: DAV:successor-report\n   Must this be supported by core versioning?  With single-line-of-descent\n   versioning, I would think that this report wouldn't be particularly useful,\n   and would just be extra work.\n\nYou need this report (actually, it is now a property)\nto get a URL for the version that is the successor.\n\n   Section 11.3 DAV:checkout-report\n   Must this be supported by servers that only allow a single checkout to the\n   same URL as the version selector?  With a server that simple, all a user\n   needs to do is find out if the resource is currently checked out to get all\n   the information they would out of this report.\n\nJust knowing that a version is checked out doesn't tell you anything\nabout the current state of that checked out resource (i.e. it's\ncurrent content or properties or location).  Especially if the checked\nout resource is a working resource, it might be hard to find it otherwise.\n\n   Speaking of which, how do I find out who checked out a resource?\n\nBy looking at the DAV:creator-displayname of the checked-out resource\n(or any other relevant property of the checked-out resource).\n\n   Section 11.4.1\n   This example contains a \"latest-checkin-report\".  The response includes a\n   single XML element, DAV:href.  I'd like to see the name of the report\n   included in every report, so it would be clearer to the client what it's\n   receiving:\n\nIn 09, this has been converted to be a live property rather than a\nreport, so the issue no longer arises.\n\nAlso note that it is unclear whether including this in the response\nwould help a client that didn't know what it just asked for (:-).\n\n   Section 11.5, DAV:version-tree-report\n   It does make sense to have this supported by \"core\".  But, does it have to\n   be nested?  The simple and common case will be a single-line-of-descent\n   versioning history, which is inefficiently represented as nested.\n\nInefficiently represented?  Doesn't it just change where the closing\n</DAV:version-tree> tags appear?\n\nThe purpose of this report is to guarantee that a core client to get\nthe entire version tree in one request.  It could also do so with a\nDAV:property-report, but that report is not required by core.\n\nBTW, I also prefer a list of versions, which is why I prefer the\nthe DAV:property-report over the DAV:version-tree report, but I\ncouldn't convince the rest of the design team of this (:-).\n\n   Section 12, Advanced Versioning\n\n   I'd like to admit at this point that I didn't take as close a look at\n   Advanced versioning.  I'm primarily concerned with a reasonable set of\n   \"core\" features that can be useful, and _not_ _too_ _confusing_, for normal\n   people doing normal document authoring.\n\nIn general, we encourage reviewers to skim over the advanced features\nto see which ones they are interested in, and then look carefully at\nthat subset.  In your case, it sounds like that is primarily the\nversion history resource and the DAV:checkin-fork property.\n\nBut reviews on the whole thing are of course much appreciated!\n\n   That said, I do have a few comments.\n\n   Section 12.1, Terms\n   In the Baseline diagram -- thanks for which -- do V4 and V6 correspond to\n   versions that were created after the creation of the baseline?\n\nNot necessarily.  They are just the versions that happen to be the\ntargets of the members of the collection that was baselined.\n\n   Please specify whether that is a MUST.\n\nIt's not even a SHOULD.  It's just a MAY.\n\n  Can a baseline be created that refers to prior versins?\n\nYes, just set the targets of the members of your collection\nto be the appropriate set of prior versions.\n\n   Section 13.3, Activities, Change Sets and Branches\n   The description here of an Activity as a \"change set\" seems incompatible\n   with the description of an activity in \"terms\" as having only versions on a\n   single line of descent.\n\nWhy?  A change set would be ambiguous if it had versions on multiple\nlines of descent of a single version history.\n\n   Section 13.6, Automatic Version Control\n   How does the automatic creation of a versioned resource differ, in the\n   response, from the creation of a non-versioned resource?\n\nNot in any way required by the protocol.\n\n   If I, an\n   unsuspecting user, try to PUT a resource to a collection and it gets turned\n   into a versioned resource immediately, how do I know?\n\nBy knowing what repository you are working against ... some versioning\nrepositories only support versioned resources (i.e. they can't cope\nwith a mixture of versioned and unversioned resources).\n\n   Otherwise, I might\n   turn around and then try to version it!\n\nThat's OK.  The VERSION-CONTROL method is specifically defined to be a\nno-op in this case, to make life easier for clients.  So in general,\nfrom a protocol perspective, a client doesn't have to care whether a\nrepository automatically puts things under version control.\n\n   Section 14.2.1, DAV:version-history\n   Why isn't this property part of \"core\", if such complicated things as\n   \"version-tree-report\" are in \"core\"?\n\nNot being in \"core\" just means that it is not a required feature\nof a versioning server.  In particular, I expect *most* versioning\nservers to support the version repository resource.  I personally\nhave argued that the version history resource should be part of core,\nso I'm not the best one to defend it's not being in core (:-).\nIn particular, I believe Chris Kaler was the primary advocate of\nit not being in core.  \n\n   Is the version history totally\n   unaccessible from a \"core\" versioning server?\n\nBeing a \"core versioning\" server just sets the minimum for what you support.\nIn particular, any server can (and usually will) a significant number of\nthe advanced versioning properties, methods, and reports.\n\n   I notice there is a DAV:version-history for a version (14.2.1) and for a\n   working resource (14.3.1).  Are these the same?  How do they differ?\n   Could we have examples of the value of this property, particulary for the\n   diagrams that can be seen in section 13.5 or similar?\n\nIn 09.1, only a version has a DAV:version-history property.  \nIf you want to get the version history associated with a\nversion selector, you would get it from its DAV:target or\nDAV:checked-out version (you can get it with one round trip\nusing the DAV:property-report).\n\n   Section 14.5, Workspace Properties\n   How can you definitively tell if a collection is a workspace?\n\nGood point.  I'll add a DAV:workspace property (analogous to\nthat on a version selector).  Then you can just\ncheck if its DAV:workspace property identifies itself.\n\n   Can I convert a workspace to a collection and vice versa?\n\nNo.  You create a workspace with MKWORKSPACE.  You can create\na collection that is a copy of a workspace with the COPY method.\n\n   Section 14.5.1\n   Can you convert from a collection to a workspace by adding the\n   DAV:current-activity-set property to it?\n\nNo.  \n\n   Must DAV:current-activity-set be present if a collection is a workspace?\n\nNo (in particular, it would never be present if the server\ndid not support activities).\n\n   Section 16.10, CHECKIN\n   This implies that the merge-set and auto-merge-set must be empty before the\n   request can succeed.  How do they get empty?\n\nWith PROPPATCH (note that they are not protected properties).\n\n   It's not clear if MERGE is\n   supposed to empty those props, or if the user is supposed to manually.\n\nThe postconditions of MERGE specify the effect of MERGE on the\nmerge-set and auto-merge-set.  In particular, it adds values to\nthese properties, but never removes values.\n\n   Section 17.1, MKWORKSPACE\n   I'll suggest in a separate email that MKCOL be used for this...\n\nI believe that the most important part of the definition of a method\nis its list of postconditions.  The postconditions of MKWORKSPACE\ndiffer significantly from those of MKCOL, and therefore it would be\ninappropriate to use the same method for both.  This is of course\na value call, since \"differ significantly\" is not a well-defined term.\n\n   Section 17.2, MKACTIVITY\n   What does an Activity resource look like ?  What properties does it support?\n\nSee the section 14.7: \"Activity Properties\"\n\n   Does it have a resource type?\n\nYes, required to be DAV:activity.\n\n   Does it have an owner?\n\nUp to the server.\n\n   Can you delete it?\n\nUp to the server, but if so, you'd use the DELETE method to do so.\n\n   Can you GET it?  Can you PUT it?\n\nSee sections 16.2 and 16.2.  Yes, you can, but the result is undefined\nby this protocol.\n\n   Can you PROPPATCH it? \n\nSure (you can PROPPATCH any resource).\n\n   How about MOVE/COPY?\n\nUp to the server.\n\n   Who has permissions on it?\n\nWe'll have to wait for the ACL protocol to answer that question.\n\n   Can you LOCK it?\n\nSure.\n\n   Can an \"Activity\" select versions from anywhere? \n\nYes (although a versioning server will commonly restrict them\nto being from the same repository).\n\n   How does it represent them ?\n\nAs members of its DAV:version-set.\n\n   How do you change the set of versions selected by an Activity?\n\nBy modifying the DAV:activity-set of a version, which is done\nby CHECKIN (or possibly PROPPATCH, if a server allows that).\n\n   Are MKACTIVITY and the corresponding \"activity\" resource necessary at all?\n\nAn activity has several key properties in this protocol, as well as \nall the dead/live properties that a change request\nmanagement or activity management system will want to define.\n\n   It seems that an Activity resource only exists so that it can have its URL.\n   Well, that seems stupid.\n\nDon't forget the properties (:-).\n\n   The client can easily generate a unique string --\n   how about a UUID?  -- and use that for an Activity string.\n   A more sensible readable string may even be possible, like\n   \"lisa@xythos.com,20001002T15:38,myactivity\".  Then the user just has to add\n   that to the activity-set for everything in that activity.\n   This would help reduce the load on the server.\n\nYou need a URL to apply a method (such as MERGE) to it,\nor to access it's properties (such as its DAV:version-set).\n\n   Otherwise, does the server\n   have to check everytime the activity-set is changed, to see if the\n   activities are all valid, existing activity resources?\n\nYes, just like it has to check whenever you update a property of any\nother resource (i.e. that there really is such a resource).  (That's\nit's job, after all :-).\n\n   Section 17.3, BASELINE-CONTROL\n   This is really confused.  I think this needs much more explanation of what\n   the model is before it's implementable.  What kinds of resources are you\n   supposed to be able to apply this method to?\n\nSee the preconditions of the method.  In particular, DAV:must-be-collection.\n\n   What does it do to the resource?\n\nSee the postconditions.  It sets the DAV:baseline-selector of the\ncollection to be a newly created baseline selector.  A baseline selector\nselects a baseline from a baseline history, just as a version selector\nselects a version from a version history.  This baseline selector\ncan then be checked out and in to create baselines of the collection.\n\n   Can you have multiple baselines for a single workspace, as the model\n   implies?\n\nA workspace can have several members that are baselined collections.\nEach of these baselined collections have an associated baseline selector\nwhose target is a particular baseline.  So in this sense, yes, a single\nworkspace can have multiple baselines (one from each of the baselined\ncollection members).\n\n   The model says you can only convert workspaces to baselines, but this\n   section says  you can convert collections to baselines.\n\nThat was a bug in the 08 draft ... you used to only be able to baseline\na workspace collection, but in 09, this was extended to allow you to\nbaseline any collection ... in particular, you can have baselined collections\non a server that does not support workspaces.\n\n   The new \"baseline selector\" resource that is created as a result of this\n   request is underspecified.  What is it? What properties does it have?  Can\n   you delete it?  What happens if you GET it?  What happens if you PROPFIND\n   it?\n\nGood point!  This should have been defined in the advanced versioning\nTerminology section.  The answer is that a baseline selector is just a\nversion selector whose target happens to be a baseline version.  So\nits properties and methods are just those of any other version\nselector.\n\n   Last comment, refering to no particular section:  I think the draft did a\n   bit of a poor division between \"core\" and \"advanced\" with the\n   \"version-history\" stuff.  Please take another look at what goes where; most\n   of the \"version history\" properties are specified under \"advanced\".  thanks.\n\nChris, would you like to respond to this?  You're our designated \"version\nhistory should not be in core\" advocate (:-).\n\n   I think that's enough for this mail!\n\nLisa, I would like to especially thank you for taking the trouble to\nlook over the advanced sections that probably weren't of direct interest\nto your clients or servers!  I will try to post a 9.2 draft that \ncontains the fixes/changes based on your comments by the end of the\nweek.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11093452"}, {"subject": "Re: Fewer new versioning methods, please", "content": "Note:  I'll omit issues that have already been addressed in previous\npostings.\n\n\n   From: \"Lisa Dusseault\" <lisa@xythos.com>\n\n   General principles:\n    - New methods require new code.  Old methods may allow reuse of more,\n   perhaps all code, either on the client or the server or both.\n\nNew methods do not necessarily require much new code.  They just\nrequire new entry points that are free to call existing code whenever\nappropriate.\n\n    - New methods require new specification.  This seems easy, but I find the\n   cost to be actually high.  Don't forget, not only must the draft-writers\n   define the new method in all its combinatorial glory, but also every\n   implementor has to fill in the holes which necessarily exist. \n\nA new method does require a new specification, but this can be based\non inheritance or delegation (i.e. this is the same as foo but adds\nthe following postconditions).  This the approach taken by the\nadvanced versioning extensions to the core versioning methods.\n\nWhether or not the extension has a new method name or not shouldn't\naffect this much one way or the other.\n\n    - New methods may require firewall or proxy attention.  What if the\n   adminstrator forgets to add MKACTIVITY to the list of methods that their\n   firewall allows?\n\nIf you care about firewall penetration, then you'll just use CONNECT,\nbecause you can't be sure that even PROPPATCH will make it through.\n\n   The specific commands I'd like to see NOT invented:\n\n   SET-TARGET\n   ----------\n\n   Here is a case where I strongly feel that too much extra implementation (and\n   specification, and test) effort is required to implement this functionality\n   with new methods.  Isn't this an easy one to replace with PROPPATCH?\n\nNot on the server side, because the content and all the dead\nproperties have to be updated as well, and there is nothing in\nexisting PROPPATCH that will do this.\n\n   The\n   only reason I can imagine for having a new method is so that I can name a\n   version-name or label in SET-TARGET, and the server can then turn around and\n   put the full version URL in the DAV:target property.  But it doesn't seem\n   that versions have URLs any more, or at least I'm confused about whether you\n   have version URLs any more.\n\nYes, versions have URL's.  We just don't use a special name like\n\"version URL's\" for them anymore.  (After all, there had to be\nsomething in all those properties containing href's that refer to versions :-).\n\n   LABEL\n   -----\n\n   I would even prefer a new method called \"ADDPROPVALUE\" or \"MVPROPPATCH\" or\n   \"ADDVALUE\" that serves to add a new value to any multi-value prop, rather\n   than this extremely specialized LABEL method.\n\nClients need a reliable way of saying \"fail if this label is already\nset on another version\".  They also need a way of saying \"remove this\nlabel from another version if its already on that other version\".\nThere's no way of making this important distinction with a simple\nPROPPATCH.\n\n   VERSION-CONTROL\n   ---------------\n\n   Obviously, the server needs to have special code to deal with the case where\n   \"isversioned\" is changed with a PROPPPATCH: it needs to set a few other\n   properties and create a version-history.  The server would have to have\n   special code to deal with VERSION-CONTROL, too.\n\nAnd a new initial version ... this seems like a lot of side effects for\nsetting a boolean property to \"T\".\n\n   I'd like to note, however, that you shouldn't require a version-history to\n   be created when a resource is made versioned.  There's only one version at\n   the time, the \"current\" one.  The server can easily go create the\n   version-history when the second version is created.  This improvement, which\n   I recommend anyway, makes the \"isversioned\" property even easier to\n   PROPPATCH.\n\nThis does make the model significantly less regular, for little\nobvious benefit.\n\n   I know this one is a little difficult, but I have a strong reason to ask for\n   it:  current state of DAV client APIs.   I'd like to be able to use an\n   existing DAV client library and start do do versioning without a lot of\n   extra trouble.  This is mostly possible:  with auto-versioning, I don't need\n   to do CHECKOUT and CHECKIN; mostly RFC2518 actions can be used to interact\n   with versioned resources.   The more behaviour we allow with PROPPATCH\n   instead of SET-TARGET and VERSION-CONTROL, the closer we come to quick and\n   easy client implementation.  I may even be able to use a completely\n   un-altered DAV client, as long as it allows me to enter in values to set for\n   random properties: just turn versioning ON with PROPPATCH, and I've now got\n   a version history,  Although it may be difficult for me to navigate to old\n   versions immediatley, at least I know they're there.\n\nIt doesn't seem likely that a generic PROPPATCH client will make a\nvery effective versioning client, so it doesn't seem like a\ncompelling reason to force the protocol through the property mechanism.\n\n   UNCHECKOUT\n   ----------\n\n   This is a minor one, but I thought that UNCHECKOUT might as well be modeled\n   as a CHECKIN with \"cancel-checkout\" in its body.  It seems much simpler to\n   state requirements then -- \"A CHECKOUT must be followed by a number of write\n   operations, followed by a CHECKIN\".\n\nActually, I proposed this a while back, and it didn't get a warm\nreception.  I didn't really care that much one way or another, so I\njust let it drop.\n\n\n   BASELINE-CONTROL\n   ----------------\n\n   Like VERSION-CONTROL, I believe this can be done with PROPPATCH.  First, it\n   sets the \"DAV:baseline-selector\" on the collection.  That's easily done with\n   PROPPATCH.\n\n   The other is more complicated, and would require a little rethinking but the\n   result is I think an easier model all around.  It requires not having a\n   resource that is a \"baseline selector\".  What is the point of this resource?\n   Why isn't the information contained in this resource instead part of the\n   property set of the baseline collection itself?  Does a baseline selector\n   have a URL?  Can it be deleted?  Who is the owner?  What properties does it\n   have?   Where is it located?  How do I delete a baseline -- do I have to\n   delete the baseline selector resource AND proppatch the\n   \"DAV:baseline-selector\" property on the collection?  Can the two be\n   inconsistent?  What about the period of time inbetween the two actions?\n\nA baseline selector is just a version selector, where the versions happen\nto be baselines.  So a baseline selector just has all the properties and\nmethods of a version selector.  This makes it very simple and regular to model.\n\n   I do feel that MERGE is a completely appropriate new method, doing something\n   quite unlike any previous method. Just to prove I know some moderation.  :)\n\nOK, we'll keep MERGE then (:-).\n\nThe most vocal advocate of new methods for everything was Chris Kaler\n(he even wanted separate methods for querying version information,\nand not even use properties for that).  So we seem to have ended up\nin a compromise between your position and Chris's position ... new methods\nfor operations that have side effects beyond setting the value of a\nsingle property, but using properties to determine the current versioning\nstate.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11114494"}, {"subject": "Re: A bit more on MERG", "content": "   From: \"Lisa Dusseault\" <lisa@xythos.com>\n\n   \"The MERGE method is responsible for determining\"... I suspect this should\n   read \"The server is responsible for determining\", or possibly, \"The MERGE\n   method contains the information necessary to determine\".\n\nWhat is the difference between \"The MERGE method is responsible\" and\n\"The server is responsible\" ?  \n\n   How can a collection of version selectors be a destination? Are they _all_\n   the destination?\n\nA collection can be the Destination, and then it is up to the MERGE\nmethod to determine for each version identified by the request URL,\nwhich version selector in that collection should be the merge\ndestination of that version.\n\n   How can a request-URL identify a version?\n\nEvery version has a URL (assigned to it by the server).  Or the\nrequest URL can identify an activity or a baseline, in which case all\nversions in that resource's DAV:version-set are merged.\n\n   Rather than have the request-URL be an activity, I'd prefer to see the\n   activity named in the body of the MERGE.\n\nThat would be fine with me, and then we could have the request-URL\nidentify the merge destination (and not have to use the Destination\nheader).

I'll update the protocol to make this\nclearer.\n\n   (I'm still confused about whether the merge-set and auto-merge set\n   properties are supposed to be cleared after a MERGE, to allow a CHECKIN, or\n   whether they should stay around for information).\n\nThe client is required to clear the merge-set and auto-merge-set\n(normally, moving those URL's to the predecessor-set), before that\nversion selector can be checked in.  I'll add some sentences to\nemphasize this in the MERGE method introduction.\n\n   \"If the merge destination is a working resource, the request version is\n   added to the DAV:merge-set\"... Why is it added, if the client intentionally\n   left it out?\n\nThe server sets it, not the client.  The purpose of the MERGE\noperation is to have the server, not the client, figure out what needs\nto be merged.\n\n   What is \"the request version\" -- I thought there could be\n   several according to the introductory paragraph on MERGE?\n\nThis are a set of request versions.  This sentence indicates what\nis done with each of them.\n\n   And, do you mean\n   that the \"request version\", whichever it is, is added to the DAV:merge-set\n   property only, or that it is actually added to the set of documents being\n   merged?\n\nWhat does \"actually added to the set of documents being merged\" mean?\n\n   \"If the merge destination is a version selector whose target is neither a\n   descendant nor an ancestor of the request version...

Doesn't\nthe use of VERSION-CONTROL turn the target -- say \"foo.doc\" -- from a\nregular resource into a version selector which points a version with the\ncontents that used to be in \"foo.doc\"?  I thought a PUT to \"foo.doc\", when\n\"foo.doc\" is actually not a single-versioned resource but a version selector\nwhich points to one of a selection of versions, would result in a creation\nof a new version.  If that is true, then how is PUT with Overwrite:T\npossibly going to overwrite the version selector?\n\n>    Please clarify if \"overwrite:F\" should result in no write at all if a\n>    versioned resource exists at the destination.\n>\n> Again, I assume you mean \"version selector\".

It's easier to adapt a test suite that already\nhas PROPPATCH; it's easier to specify how PROPPATCH of a new prop should\nwork than to specify a whole new METHOD (with attendant headers, how does\neach header interact with method, errors, etc).\n\n\n>    ...

Please put this in the draft.\nWe also need <DAV:multiple-checkouts-forbidden/> for servers which not only\ndo not allow checkout of a version that has already been checked out, but\nalso do not allow checkout on any version of a resource for which any\nversion has already been checked out.\n\n>    Can you do a CHECKIN if you haven't done a CHECKOUT?\n>\n> Depends what you mean by \"you\".

Just make\nthe only valid values of the \"DAV:target\" property be values which the\nclient/user would be unlikely to come up with at random.  I think my\nrecommendation fit that bill, because it ensconced the URL in a <href> tag,\nthe name in a <name> tag, etc.\n\nSo if a server supports putting a URL to a version in \"DAV:target\", you\nwould set (in the body of the PROPPATCH):\n  <D:target><D:href>http://foo.bar/my.doc,1</D:href></D:target>\n\nIf the server supports putting a label in \"DAV:target\", you would set\n  <D:target><D:label>beta2</D:label></D:target>\n\nFinally, if the server supports putting a version-name in a \"DAV:target\",\nyou would set\n  <D:target><D:version-name>beta2</D:version-name></D:target>\n\nWhy is this any more dangerous than SET-TARGET?  It's no more likely to be\nused accidentally!\n\n\nA thought to throw out:  I would support replacing SET-TARGET and\nVERSION-CONTROL (maybe LABEL, and maybe a couple others) with a new method\nthat treats \"settings\" (things with side effects) differently from\n\"properties\".\n\nSo we could name this \"SET\" (or \"SETTINGPATCH\" or \"CHANGE-SETTING\" if you\nwant verbosity); It would be very similar to PROPPATCH in syntax.\n - This method would only be used to change one setting at a time, since\nchanging multiple settings at a time brings up concerns of the interactions\nand order of application.\n - Atomicity wouldn't be a concern if it only changes one setting at a time.\n - We would only have to define syntax once -- whether depth is allowed, how\nother headers might apply, what errors can be returned -- rather than define\nsyntax every time we want to do something similar to this in any DAV-related\nprotocol design effort\n - It would be a good \"bundle\" of activity -- like PROPPATCH -- to which a\nsingle permission might reasonably be applied\n\nLisa\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11139035"}, {"subject": "Re: More detailed responses to responses..", "content": "See <tim2> tags below...\n\n\n>    Section 5.2.6, DAV:version-name\n>    Refers to Version URL.

Since there's already so much variation in server\nimplementation possibilities (auto-versioning, automatic creation of\nversioned resources, what URLs of versions look like, etc.)  I'd rather not\nleave that up to the guesswork of the client.  I could imagine a resource\nthat \"used to be\" versioned appearing very much like a resource that is\ncurrently versioned.  A definitive property that declares whether a\nresource\nis a version selector, a version, or a version history would clearly fix\nthis.\n\n<tim2> I agree.  The spec does give definitive rules for identifying types\nby the presence of properties, but this is IMHO a suboptimal way of doing\nbusiness.  Someone (you know who you are<g>) was going to check to see if\nwebfolders would work in the face of 'strucured' resource type values, and\nif we could be backwards compatible, this would be my preference (i.e., a\nresource type would be <DAV:collection><DAV:version-selector/>... etc.)\nFailing this approach, a separate property would be good.\n\n>    Section 6.1, Overwrite\n>    Does this section imply that doing a PUT, POST, COPY or MOVE with a\n>    destination URL that is versioned with \"Overwrite: T\" header\n> should delete\n>    all the version history and replace the versioned resource\n> with either a\n>    non-versioned resource -- or a versioned resource whose\n> history has been\n>    deleted??

I'm concerned about servers that support auto-versioning\nhere, so for those servers...\n\nIf I do a PUT to a version selector, isn't that interpreted as a write to\nthe resource whose versions are represented by the version selector?\n\n<tim2> No, a version selector is a resource in its own right, with content\nand properties.  Implementation aside, think of a checked in version\nselector as an immutable copy of a version whose DAV:target indicates where\nit was copied from.  Checking out such a version selector opens the copy\nfor change ('in place'), and updates via PUT/whatever to the version\nselector are 'isolated' from other versions and the history of the resource\nassociated with the version selector.  When you checkin the version\nselector it marks it as immutable and copies the content & dead properties\ninto a new version (in the version history).\n\n<tim2> As I said, you wouldn't want to implement it this way, but that's\nhow I choose to think about it.\n\n<tim2> Now if you think about how version selectors react when they are the\ndestination of a method, it makes more sense.\n\nDoesn't the version selector \"pass through\" most requests somehow?\n\n<tim2> No, the 'redirector model' leads to the wrong conclusions about the\ndelta v behaviour.  You are not the first to adopt this model from reading\nthe spec.\n\nDoesn't\nthe use of VERSION-CONTROL turn the target -- say \"foo.doc\" -- from a\nregular resource into a version selector which points a version with the\ncontents that used to be in \"foo.doc\"?  I thought a PUT to \"foo.doc\", when\n\"foo.doc\" is actually not a single-versioned resource but a version\nselector\nwhich points to one of a selection of versions, would result in a creation\nof a new version.

That seems rather harsh.\n\nIf a server is allowed to have only server-defined version names, this\nsimplifies support for a number of things.\n - don't have to support the new LABEL method (new body semantics, etc.)\n - don't have to support the \"label-name-set\" property with its special\nmulti-value semantics\n - don't have to worry about duplication/uniqueness of labels\n - SET-TARGET becomes simpler because it can only refer to a unique\nversion-name\n\nI agree that in some user scenarios (e.g. source control) it would be harsh\nto not allow human-meaningful labels, but in other user scenarios I believe\npeople won't miss the functionality.\n\nHere's the most basic versioning scenario for non-source-control.  A bunch\nof Word docs, HTML docs, stuff like that, are in a multi-user directory.\nAll the owner wants to do is keep around version history in case somebody\nscrews up inadvertently and deletes stuff which should stay in there.  If\nthat happens, all they have to do is go back to a previous version -- maybe\none or two revisions back -- and find the deleted stuff.  In this scenario,\ndoes anybody need or miss the labeling functionality?  Probably 99% of the\ntime they won't even use SET-TARGET -- the latest version is what everybody\nwill use and refer to.\n\nReally, this use of versioning can be modeled as part of archiving.  In\narchiving do people label stuff with human-readable descriptions of the\nstate of the file?  No, they typically have a tape with a date on it, and\neach file archived to tape has its standard file name.  (Versioning plus\ntape-style archiving is better than archiving alone, because every\nintermediate version is saved, not just periodic snapshots )\n\n:)  Hey, if you replace LABEL and SET-TARGET with PROPPATCH, even with\nPROPPATCH extended to support multi-value-add, I won't argue about the label\nfunctionality any more!\n\n>    Section 5.2.2/3/4, DAV:predecessor-set, DAV: successor-set,\n>    DAV:checkout-set\n>    Please clarify that for \"core\" versioning support, since in\n> \"core\" there is\n>    no way to fork or merge, that the \"predecessor-set\" and \"successor-set\"\n>    will\n>    only contain one element.  Right?\n>\n> In core versioning, there is no way to merge, but you can fork\n> (just checkout and checkin a version that already has a successor).\n\nAgain, I'd like to argue that in non-source-control situations, versioning\ndoesn't need to support forking.  If I checkout and checkin version 6, when\nversion 7 already exists, then version 8 is created.  Or, why can't the\nserver prevent >1 checkout -- it may only have one place for a working\nresource?  Then forks would be impossible.\n\nMy reasoning is simply that it's an unnecessary burden.  Outside of\nsource-control domains, I don't think users/clients have, or if they have\nthey don't usually need, the level of sophistication required to deal with\nforks.  What happens when I take \"consultant-contract.doc\" and I\nconceptually want to \"fork\" it so that I can have one descendant tailored\nfor programmers and one for editors?  I copy \"consultant-contract.doc\" to\n\"editor-contract.doc\", creating two independent versioned resources that\nhappened to start from the same content.  Now it's easier for other users to\nfind the contract they need, because they have independent names, and each\none has its own single-line-of-descent versioning tree.  I believe this is\nhow \"forking\" actually works outside of source-control situations.\n\nFor both labels and forking, why not just make these features part of\nadvanced versioning?  Then servers can choose to implement those features.\nI'm assuming here that \"core\" means \"all these features MUST be implemented\nfor a server to be standard-compliant\", and that's why I'm concerned to\nkeeping the list simple.\n\nlisa\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11234120"}, {"subject": "Making &quot;LABEL&quot; optiona", "content": "Lisa has asked that we make LABEL functionality optional\n(i.e. move it into advanced).\n\nI personally have no problem with that, since labeling\nis pretty much orthogonal to CHECKOUT/CHECKIN.\n\nDoes anyone object?

Given the desire for terseness, even suggesting this might be too much :-).\n\nCheers,\nRossW\n=====\n\nFrom http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/\n\n2.3 Caseless Matching\n\nCaseless matching is commonly implemented using case-folding. The latter is the process of mapping strings to a normalized form where case differences are erased. Case-folding allows for fast caseless matches in lookups. Caseless matching itself is only an approximation to the language-specific rules governing the strength of comparisons. Where locale-sensitive case matching is used, this information can be derived from the collation data for the language, where only the first and second level differences are used. For more information, see UTR #10: Unicode Collation Algorithm.\n\nHowever, in most environments, such as in file systems, text is not tagged with locale information. In such cases, the locale-specific mappings should not be used. Otherwise data structures, such as B-trees, might be built based on one set of case foldings, and used based on a different set, which will cause the B-trees to become corrupt. For those environments, a constant, locale-independent case folding should be used.\n\nThe CaseFolding.txt file can be used for doing such a locale-independent case folding. This file was generated from the Unicode Character Database, using both the one-to-one mappings and the one-to-many mappings. It folds all characters having different case forms together into a common form. To compare two strings for caseless matching, you can fold each string using this data, and then use a binary comparison.\n\nGenerally, where case distinctions are not important, other distinctions between Unicode characters (in particular, compatibility distinctions) are ignored as well. In such circumstances, text can be normalized to Normalization Form KC or KD after case-folding, to produce a normalized form that erases both compatibility distinctions and case distinctions. (See UTR #15: Unicode Normalization Forms for more information.)\n\n\n\"Dennis E.

You still need the two options for SET-TARGET: a label\n(which in your case would always be a version-name) and a version URL.\n\n   :)  Hey, if you replace LABEL and SET-TARGET with PROPPATCH, even with\n   PROPPATCH extended to support multi-value-add, I won't argue about the label\n   functionality any more!\n\nOK, now I'm confused.  What difference does it make to you whether\nlabeling is marshalled via LABEL or a property update.  You have to\njust as much work on your server to support labeling semantics.\n\n   > In core versioning, there is no way to merge, but you can fork\n   > (just checkout and checkin a version that already has a successor).\n\n   Again, I'd like to argue that in non-source-control situations, versioning\n   doesn't need to support forking.  If I checkout and checkin version 6, when\n   version 7 already exists, then version 8 is created.  Or, why can't the\n   server prevent >1 checkout -- it may only have one place for a working\n   resource?  Then forks would be impossible.\n\nThe purpose of DAV:predecessor is to identify the state of the\nresource right before you started changing it.  Storing the current\nDAV:latest as the DAV:predecessor would violate these semantics.  You\ncould certainly support some additional property\n(e.g. DAV:previous-latest-at-checkin-time), but that would be a\ndifferent property (and not one that appears to be of general enough\ninterest to standardize upon).\n\n   My reasoning is simply that it's an unnecessary burden.\n\nDAV:predecessor is an extremely simple property to maintain, so\nit seems reasonable to require it from all servers.\n\n   Outside of\n   source-control domains, I don't think users/clients have, or if they have\n   they don't usually need, the level of sophistication required to deal with\n   forks.\n\nA client doesn't have to deal with forks, only a server does.  And\ndealing with a fork just means storing the correct value in\nDAV:predecessor-set when you create a version, so no sophistication\nis required.\n\n   What happens when I take \"consultant-contract.doc\" and I\n   conceptually want to \"fork\" it so that I can have one descendant tailored\n   for programmers and one for editors?  I copy \"consultant-contract.doc\" to\n   \"editor-contract.doc\", creating two independent versioned resources that\n   happened to start from the same content.  Now it's easier for other users to\n   find the contract they need, because they have independent names, and each\n   one has its own single-line-of-descent versioning tree.  I believe this is\n   how \"forking\" actually works outside of source-control situations.\n\nThat's fine ... there's nothing in the version control protocol that\nprevents you from doing this.  All it asks is that all servers store\na consistent (easily determined) value in DAV:predecessor-set.\n\n   For both labels and forking, why not just make these features part of\n   advanced versioning?  Then servers can choose to implement those features.\n\nI'm sympathetic to your desire to make labeling optional ... that does\nrequire some work (although not really all that much :-).  But the cost\nfor a server of maintaining an accurate DAV:predecessor-set is so minimal,\nthat I don't see the argument for making it optional.\n\n   I'm assuming here that \"core\" means \"all these features MUST be implemented\n   for a server to be standard-compliant\", and that's why I'm concerned to\n   keeping the list simple.\n\nNote that core means \"must be implemented by a server\", not \"must be\nexposed by a client\".

For a version history, it's definitely a different resource type\n(and has DAV:version-resource as its DAV:resourcetype).

If you've got a bunch of\nproperties updated in a single proppatch, if the result is just a\nchange to those properties, it is much more reasonable to expect the\nserver to be able to predict whether or not all the requests will\nsucceed (and fail the PROPPATCH if it does not).  If on the other\nhand, one of those property updates involves a significant set of side\neffects on other properties and other resources, it becomes much more\nlikely that the server will not be able to guess (or to guess wrong),\nwhich means it must pre-emptively reject the PROPPATCH call (meaning\nthe client needs to break it up and try it separately anyway), or risk\nfailing in the middle and leaving the server in a state the client\ndoes not expect.\n\nI believe that it would lead to greater interoperation of clients and\nservers if operations with side effects were clearly identified as\nseparate methods, so that clients would not be misled into thinking\nthat they can combine multiple updates into a single atomic PROPPATCH.\n\nBut I really don't care all that much about whether we marshal our\nmethods through separate method calls or PROPPATCH, so since I think\nI've forwarded the various arguments I've heard in the past, I'll\nleave this thread for others to comment on.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11330775"}, {"subject": "RE: Making &quot;LABEL&quot; optiona", "content": "> I agree that LABEL functionality is very important, and should be\n> standardized in the protocol, but I don't see that Jim's arguments\n> identify the significant interoperability problems that will result\n> if LABEL is optional functionality.\n\nCreation or removal of interoperability problems is a poor criteria for\ndetermining what belongs in core.

While\nit\n   is true that you can support linear versioning without the use of labels,\nit\n   is similarly true that you *could* have a filesystem automatically\ngenerate\n   an identifier for each file as it is created.  My point? The ability to\n   assign a human-meaningful name to a specific revision allows people to\nmore\n   easily remember ones that are significant.  Instead of remembering that\n   version 1.6 was the one sent out to customers, a label of \"Release_A\" can\nbe\n   used instead. Thus the label feature addresses a basic cognitive recall\n   problem inherent in the use of machine generated identifiers for\nrevisions.\n   Since the machine generated identifiers are part of core versioning, the\n   remedy for them should also be part of core.\n\n   The vast majority of commercial and research versioning systems provide\nsome\n   mechanism for assigning a human readable name to a revision, typically in\n   the form of a label.  I will take the liberty of assuming that they are\nnot\n   blindly coding a feature everyone else has, and have provided it because\nit\n   offers a function their user base has found to be useful.  Doesn't it\nseems\n   that such a commonly occurring versioning feature should also be part of\nour\n   core versioning?\n\n   Finally, I am sure that there exist user communities that are confused by\n   the very notion of versioning, who will never use the label feature.\n   Similarly, I am sure there are communities of novice word processing\nusers\n   that are confused by the very notion of word processing, and never use\nthe\n   spell checking feature.

Using this as the criteria, I could argue\n   that CHECKOUT should be optional, since it is impossible to identify any\n   significant interoperability problems that would result from it being put\n   into advanced versioning.\n\nA core client that tries to do a CHECKIN without a CHECKOUT\nwill fail against an advanced server that requires a CHECKOUT\nto precede a CHECKIN.\n\nIn contrast, a core client that does not set any labels works\njust fine against advanced servers.\n\n   Such a move would raise *oper*ability problems,\n   but that is my point. CHECKOUT's inclusion in core versioning depends on its\n   utility for basic versioning use.  \n\nI disagree.  CHECKOUT's inclusion in core reflects the fact that the\nversioning model requires CHECKOUT's to precede CHECKIN's.  The versioning\nmodel does not require any version to be labeled.\n\n   Similarly, my previous argument was that\n   labels provide such a valuable facility, useful across such a wide range of\n   users and use cases, that it belongs in core.\n\nThis is even more true for a \"history resource\", but we did not make\nthat part of core because it was not essential for effective versioning\nbehavior.\n\n   I illustrated this by\n   identifying how labels address the naming problems that accompany the use of\n   machine-generated version identifiers.  Since these problems would be part\n   of core, it seems to me their remedy should also be part of core.\n\nLabels are not needed to address the naming problem.  I consider the\nlist that Lisa provided of versioning servers that don't provide\nlabels as an existence proof of this.  In particular, we already have\na large number of standardized properties that a client can use to\nhelp the user to name and select the version they want.  For example,\nin core we provide DAV:creator-displayname and DAV:comment, and 2518\nprovides DAV:displayname.  In addition, there are a variety of server\ngenerated strings that supplement this user defined information, such\nas DAV:version-name, DAV:checkin-date, DAV:getmodificationdate, etc.\n\nA client can just ask for a DAV:version-tree report with the relevant\nfields, and the user can use that information to select the version of\ninterest.\n\nLabels with their \"can only identify one version\" property are\ncertainly useful, but by no means essential.\n\n   Any of the methods we're proposing *could* be optional, and a\n   client *could* adapt to whatever features the server provides.  The net\n   result of this would not be increased simplicity on the client side, though.\n\nI assume that all clients will give their user the ability to browse\n(and set) properties like DAV:displayname and DAV:comment on the\nversions.  Whether this is supplemented by the ability to put labels\non those versions seems like a reasonable thing to make optional,\nwith no significant increase in complexity of the client (just grey out\nthe \"label\" menu item).\n\n   Labels are such a widely provided feature across version control systems\n   that the burden of proof really lies on those who want to move this\n   functionality out of core.\n\nI believe that Lisa has now done this.\n\n   I really need to be convinced that the absence\n   of labels won't: (a) violate the expectations of versioning-aware users of\n   DeltaV applications (I personally would think the absence of labels to be\n   extremely odd in a modern versioning system), and (b) lead to increased\n   cognitive difficulties due to the absence of revision naming capabilities.\n\nI consider that most of the systems that Lisa identified to be modern\nversioning systems ... it's just that they are not software\nconfiguration management systems.  So if our protocol were only\ntargeted at software configuration management, I'd agree with you, but\nI believe it is essential that core be a suitable \"core\"\n(i.e. minimum) for both document management and software configuration\nmanagement.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11486949"}, {"subject": "Re: DAV:checked-ou", "content": "   From: Greg Stein <gstein@lyra.org>\n\n   > <boris> The change was made because in the old spec, servers that \n   > supported workspaces would be confusing for clients because they replaced\n   > version selectors on checkout whereas other servers created working\n   > resources at a new URL. </boris>\n\n   But then the second client to check the thing out would be attemping to\n   check out a WORKING resource.

You create that workspace once, and then do all your\ncheckout/checkin's on version selectors in that workspace.  You would\nonly create a second workspace for yourself if you were working on two\nprojects at the same time, in which case you'd create one workspace\nfor each project you are concurrently working on.\n\n   We're talking a very transitory operation, and building up a workspace for\n   that isn't right.

However,\nsuch experience is highly desirable, and will usually represent a strong\nargument in favor of a Proposed Standard designation.\n\nMany details on the procedures used to develop an IETF standard can be\nfound in RFC 2026, available at: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt\n\nIf there are any procedural questions or concerns, please do not hesitate\nto contact me, or raise an issue on the list.\n\nNotes:\n\n1) Issues raised during the last call period will be resolved individually,\nrather than lumped together and dealt with as a whole.  This follows the\nissue-resolution convention being followed in the HTTP WG.\n\n2) If you've been waiting for a \"stable\" version of the specification\nbefore performing a review, you need wait no longer.  This is it.  We value\nyour input, but time is running out.

We just renamed to to core\nversioning and advanced options because there appeared to be little\nagreement on what the levels should be. This is fine. My only point is that\nits interesting to note that optional labels never came up (that I can\nremember).</jra>\n\nNow that the dust has settled, and we have received a very thorough\nreview from a document management provider, I believe we need to\ntake that review very seriously.  The fact that configuration\nmanagement providers are happy to provide labeling support is\nto be expected, and is therefore neither very surprising nor\nespecially interesting.  If we want document management system\nproviders to implement the versioning protocol (and I certainly do),\nwe need to set the \"functionality bar\" at a level appropriate for\ndocument management.\n\n<jra>There has been DMS representation in the DeltaV working group and on\nthe design team. Of course, not every DMS was represented. But we have\nincluded many concepts and compromises to accommodate DMS systems. Perhaps\noptional label support is another. But I think its a little like saying we\nwant optional user-specified URLs for resources. I'm willing to consider\nmaking labels optional, but I would like to challenge the assumption that\nincluding them in core is setting the bar too high. I have designed WebDAV\ninterfaces to two versioning management systems that didn't support\nlabeling as specified by the protocol. Both designs supported labels. I\njust hid them in my own server-defined properties.</jra>\n\n\nThe combination of standard client defined properties like DAV:comment\nand DAV:creator-displayname, custom client defined properties, and\nstandard server defined properties like DAV:version-name and\nDAV:getmodificationdate, are sufficient to name and locate versions of\ninterest, and this is demonstrated by the document management systems\nthat do so (without the use of labels).\n\n<jra>This does not sound like either an adequate, optimal, or interoperable\nway of distinguishing revisions of the same versioned resource.\nDAV:verion-name might not be meaningful to a user, might not be used on\nmore than one versioned resource, and can't be moved.\nDAV:creator-displayname is not unique to a revision. Relying on DAV:comment\nto distinguish revisions would introduce the possibility of parsing comment\nstrings to identify a revision. This doesn't sound convenient or\ninteroperable. DAV:getmodificationdate has no logical meaning although is\nis sometimes useful to identify revisions by when they changed. Custom\nclient defined properties would not result in an interoperable solution.\n\nLisa, of the versioning repositories you surveyed, which ones are planning\non implementating a WebDAV interface? Of those, how many would like to have\nlabel support if there was some convenient way to provide it? Could labels\nbe persisted in a server-defined property? Would it be OK for the WebDAV\nserver implementation to do the labeling semantics, and just use the\nunderlying DMS repository for persistence?</jra>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11686682"}, {"subject": "Re: labels as DAV:target values (was Re: Fewer new versioning methods, please!", "content": "   From: \"Lisa Dusseault\" <lisa@xythos.com>\n\n   Could somebody explain why locking of version selectors is a required\n   feature?\n\nLocking of version selectors (or anything else for that matter)\nis not a required feature of the versioning protocol.  But\nthe versioning protocol is designed to be compatible with the\nlocking protocol.\n\n   What is the purpose?\n\nIt allows you to GET the current contents of a checked-out version\nselector, and then PUT your updates without having to worry about\noverwriting updates to that checked-out version selector by another\nclient (potentially, another client running on your behalf).\n\n   What is the result?\n\nJust usual locking semantics.  I.e. can't modify content, dead properties,\nor MOVE it without holding the lock token.\n\n   Does it affect checkouts?\n\nYes, you do need the lock token to checkout a locked version selector.\n(But not if you are applying the checkout to a version, only if you\nare directly checking out the version selector).  I personally voted\nagainst having CHECKOUT care about locks (since it doesn't change\nthe content or dead properties of the version selector), but was\noutvoted (and I didn't care very much one way or the other).\n\n   I reason that if it was not possible to lock a version selector,\n   then it would be possible to use labels as DAV:target values, which seems to\n   me to be a very useful feature.\n\nYes, compatibility with locking semantics is one of the reasons why we\ndo not support the use of labels as DAV:target values.  Having locking\nwork with versioning was deemed more important than having a label as\na DAV:target value.\n\n   I would imagine that the only affect locking a version selector would have\n   is that it would prevent others from doing a PROPPATCH to one of the version\n   selector's own properties.\n\nA version selector only has its own properties (and its own content).\nSome of its properties (and content) happen to be the same as that of\nsome version while it is in the checked-in state, but they are still\nits own properties and its own content.\n\nSo locking a version selector has the usual semantics, i.e. it prevents\nmodification to the content and dead properties of that version selector\nunless the lock token is specified.\n\n   It wouldn't prevent others from checking out one\n   of the versions related to the version selector;\n\nThat is correct, a lock on a version selector does not prevent you\nfrom doing a checkout on any of the versions of the version history\nof the current target.  In particular, you can do a CHECKOUT/DAV:target\non a locked version selector without the lock token (since that checkout\nis applied to the target version, and not to the version selector\nitself).\n\n   it wouldn't prevent others\n   from doing a PUT or a PROPPATCH to the version to which the version selector\n   points (that would have to be accomplished by doing a LOCK on the version\n   resource, rather than the version selector).\n\nYou can't do a PUT or a PROPPATCH to the content or dead properties\nof a version (even a mutable version requires it to be done with a\nCHECKIN).\n\nIt is true that a system that supports mutable versions will need to\ncheck the locks of every version selector whose target is that mutable\nversion before allowing a CHECKIN/DAV:replace on that version, but\nthat is avoidable by not supporting mutable versions (the sensible\nthing to do :-).  In any case, at least it is only one routine, CHECKIN\nwhere this check would have to be made, and none of the other update\nroutines (PUT,PROPPATCH,MOVE,COPY,DELETE,MERGE,etc.)\n\n   Has anybody done some serious thinking, in general, about how they are going\n   to implement locking interacting with versioning?\n\nI know that we have.\n\n   What happens when a\n   versioning-unaware client tries to LOCK a resource, not aware that it is\n   actually locking a version selector?  Is the behaviour what that client\n   would expect?\n\nYup.  That's been one of the challenges of designing the versioning protocol,\nbecause there are a large number of clients out there (e.g. office-2000\nclients) that will be trying to lock resources and will not be aware that\nthey are actually locking a version selector.\n\n   Finally, I wonder why the draft specifically disallows using labels as\n   DAV:target values.\n\nOne important reason is that it is incompatible with locking, and as\nindicated above, compatibility with locking was deemed more important\n(especially if you care about interoperability) than was having labels\nas DAV:target values.  In addition, all of the arguments that apply\nto locks are likely to apply to access control as well, so locking\nis just the most obvious reason.\n\n   Just because some implementations would find it\n   difficult doesn't mean all of them will.\n\nThis is a problem for all implementations that care about locking,\nand that will care about access control.\n\n   Why not make it optional -- and if\n   a server doesn't support a value of <D:label>foo</D:label> then the server\n   can respond with an error meaning \"unsupported value given for DAV:target\n   property\".\n\nDefining a feature of the protocol that is known to be incompatible\nwith another important feature of the protocol is a very serious\nsource of non-interoperability.  Any client functionality or protocol\nextension based on one of the features will be incompatible with all\nfunctionality or protocol extensions based on the other feature.\nTo work around the incompatibility, one ends up designing additional\nfeatures that serve the same function but in a subtly different way\nto avoid the incompatibility.  But then all layered functionality must\nalso be revisited and duplicated.  As the number of incompatible\nfeatures increase, the problematic interactions increase combinatorially.\n\nCompare this to the question of making labeling optional.  Labeling\nis designed to be completely compatible with HTTP-1.1, WebDAV, core\nversioning, and all other advanced versioning features.  If any server\nencounters the need to provide labeling support, it can do so\nindependent of what other optional features of the protocol it has\nchosen to support.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-11698338"}, {"subject": "RE: Making &quot;LABEL&quot; optiona", "content": "(In reply to Lisa's posting...)\n\n<jra>Lisa, I appreciate you concern for minimizing the requirements for DMS\nsystems. They play an important role in Web authoring. Perhaps we have a\ndifferent view of labels though.

Labels in WebDAV aren't \"sticky\". You can't\nlock a label on a revision. So you could use a label to name a consistent\nset of revisions, but you can't be sure you'd always get the same\nrevisions.

Labels are just a way of distinguishing one revision from\nanother using an identifier that has some meaning to the user making the\ndistinction. So in your example, I find lots of meaning in document\nrevisions labeled as \"last call\" even though there is no relationship\nbetween them(manifest as links or references) that needs to be captured as\na consistent set in a baseline. The label just helps identify which version\nof the document is in the last call state. Its just easier than saying \"go\nlook at revision 1AB2795\" or some other equally meaningful server generated\nid. This seems pretty useful, and its pretty simple.\n\nAre you thinking that label support implies baseline support, or that there\nis even a relationship between them? Baselines have nothing to do with\nlabels. They are not related in the protocol. Labels are just added and\nremoved from revisions. The only requirement is that the same label can't\nbe on more than one revision of the same versioned resource at the same\ntime.

Thankfully, I could implement\n   a lot of DeltaV and just completely disregard the workspace concept.\n\nYou are maintaining a copy of the versioned resource tree (sometimes\ncalled a \"sandbox\") on your client I assume, for local builds,\ndisconnected use, etc. ?\n\nNow what if you wanted to represent that sandbox on the server?\nThat's what a workspace is.\n\nHere's some additional motivation I'll be adding to the \"Workspace\"\nsection of the protocol:\n\n-----------------------------\nIt is often desirable to allow several clients on behalf of a single\nuser to access a related set of checked-out resources.  In particular,\nthis allows a user to access these resources from several physical\nlocations, such as from another office, from home, from a remote site,\nor while traveling, without being forced to prematurely checkin those\nchecked-out resources.  Sometimes it is even desirable to provide\nshared access to checked-out resources for several closely cooperating\nusers (using WebDAV locking to avoid overwrite problems).\n\nIf only one set of checked-out resources is required, then this can be\nachieved with core versioning by simply checking out the appropriate\nversion selectors.  This approach is often unacceptable because it\nexposes the intermediate states of the checked-out resources to every\nclient, and does not allow for a second set of checked-out resources\nto be defined for a group that wishes to be isolated from the\nintermediate states of another group.  Unfortunately, working\nresources do not address this problem, because although they allow\nmultiple concurrent checkouts from a single version history, there is\nno mechanism for grouping related working resources into an\nidentifiable set.\n\nA related problem is that it is often desirable to isolate clients\nfrom a logical change that involves renaming shared resources, until\nthat logical change is complete and tested.  When all clients use a\ncommon set of shared version selectors, every client sees the result\nof a MOVE as soon as it occurs.\n\nAn additional problem is that it is often necessary to perform testing\non the server rather than on the client.  Since a test routine on the\nserver has no way of knowing what working resources or what versions\nare to be tested, only the versions selected as the current target of\nthe version selectors can be tested.  This not only does not allow\ntesting of a checked-out resource before checking it in, but also does\nnot provide for any parallel testing of different configurations of\nversioned resources.\n\nTo address these problems, advanced versioning introduces the concept\nof a \"workspace\".  A workspace is a collection whose members are a set\nof related version selectors and unversioned resources.

I know of at least a couple of systems that\nsupport baselining but not per-version labels.

So it is very likely the only time you will run into\na server that supports labels and not baselining is when the label\nimplementation does not support effective (efficient) baselining.\nBut that of course is up to the client writer ... heck, you could\ntry to fake all of WebDAV on top of GET and PUT if you really \nwanted to (it just wouldn't work very well :-).\n\nBut even if you decide to fake baselines on with labels, all that\nmaking labels optional would mean is that you would grey out\nyour baselining functionality if neither baselines or labels\nwere available.\n\n   Then there is the question of case significance in labels.

If you want labeling, just get a server that supports it,\n   > and then it's easy for a client to expose it, since we've standardized\n   > on what labeling looks like when it is supported.\n\n   An advantage of making labels optional naturally is that a server\n   can decide to implement workspaces and baselines and instead save\n   itself the trouble of implementing labels.\n\nThat's a good point ... I know of at least a couple of systems that\nsupport baselining but not per-version labels.  And even when a server\nsupports both baselines and labels, a client is *much* better off to\nuse the server's native baseline support, since a good server will\nimplement baselining in a far superior way natively than can be done\nby a client using the servers labeling mechanism.\n\n   Nevertheless I would\n   like to see labels in core versioning as a simple means for\n   creating baselines.\n\nNote: In general, I'd discourage a client from trying to \"fake\"\nbaselines on a server that supports labels but not baselines.\nIf the label implementation was truly suitable for supporting\nbaselining (and many are not), then a sensible server writer will\ndo the trivial amount of extra work to support the baselining\nprotocol.  So it is very likely the only time you will run into\na server that supports labels and not baselining is when the label\nimplementation does not support effective (efficient) baselining.\nBut that of course is up to the client writer ... heck, you could\ntry to fake all of WebDAV on top of GET and PUT if you really\nwanted to (it just wouldn't work very well :-).\n\nBut even if you decide to fake baselines on with labels, all that\nmaking labels optional would mean is that you would grey out\nyour baselining functionality if neither baselines or labels\nwere available.\n\n   Then there is the question of case significance in labels. I would\n   prefer case significance. Especially when I read about the trouble\n   with capitalizing letters which don't have an upper case.  There\n   was a long discussion a while ago and I guess that Geoff takes as a\n   consensus that the server can decide what to do. That right Geoff ?\n   In this case I see a small problem when resources with labels are\n   moved from a server which supports labels with case significance to\n   one which doesn't. But perhaps the market can rule again in this\n   case ?\n\n   > Yeah, I was a strong advocate of Workspace headers too, until\n   > I ran into those pesky technical problems ... (:-).\n\n   So you will probably want to kill workspace headers completely.\n\nYes.\n\n   I just thought whether it would make sense to save it by saying it\ndoesn't\n   apply for the method URL. So the server still could find out which\nsubtree\n   and by this which module would be concerned. A drawback would be that\n   the method URL would be a special case but I suppose there are bigger\n   problems (Sorry to ask but I don't have time at the moment to get all\n   the postings I missed the last months).\n\nYes, the problems arise for all URL's whether it is the request URL,\na URL in a header, or a URL in the content.\n\n   OTOH I don't like to parse a URL to find out whether it is in some\nworkspace\n   or not (Yes I know it's possible :-)\n\nIt's not so much a parsing issue (workspace URL's look like any other\nURL) as it is a property or semantic issue.  In particular, every\nversion selector in a workspace has a DAV:workspace property which\ntells you which workspace the version selector is in (if any).\n\n   So you see that I have some gripes but these aren't showstoppers for me.\n   I suppose I could live with them.

If there are unversioned\ncollections at, or below, the collection being baselined, there is\ninsufficient information to make the baseline useful for restoring that\nconfiguration.\n\nHere's a simple scenario that shows the problem:\n\n1.

We specifically do not define how that information is\nto be captured, in order to allow for the diverse ways of implementing\nbaselines.\n\nBut one thing that does need to be fixed is in the section that\nintroduces the baseline concept, it says \"the state of a baseline is\nlimited to be a set of versions\".  This needs to be changed to say:\n\"the state of a baseline is limited to be a set of versions and their\nrelative names in the collection\".\n\n   Here's a simple scenario that shows the problem:\n\n...\n\n   7.

Before draft 10.2, you had to do a\nSET-TARGET as well, so this was only specified in the SET-TARGET\npostconditions.\n\n   However, this would only be possible if the baseline remembered\n   more information than just the DAV:version-set; it would also need\n   to remember that the collection had a \"file1\" internal member, and\n   the associated target version is http://example.org/vers/vh1/v1.\n\nYes, but an implementation is free to capture this information in any\nway it sees fit ... in collection versions, as a \"name-map\" table, or\nwhatever.  It's only requirement is that when time comes to restore\nthe baseline, it knows what the relative names are.\n\n   While the above scenario shows that there's a hole in the story for\n   the root collection of a baseline, the same problem exists for\n   unversioned collections anywhere below the root.\n\nIt's a \"hole\" in a good way, i.e. it allows a client to get what it\nwants done, while giving an implementation flexibility in how to\nimplement it.\n\n   The main requirement is that a useful baseline is one that can be\n   restored.  The issue to decide is what constitutes being\n   \"restored\".\n\nI believe this is fully defined in the post-conditions of\nBASELINE-CONTROL and SET-TARGET (the two ways a baseline can be\n\"restored\").\n\n   Two general approaches:\n\n   (A) Only allow baselining of versioned collections. Effectively,\n   \"baseline\" becomes an optional add-on to \"versioned-collection\",\n   and baselines cannot be offered by a server that is not prepared to\n   offer versioned collections.

It is not perfectly fidelity, since non-versioned\n   members are not captured; but this is compatible with the general\n   philosophy for versioning collections.\n\nThat is certainly one reasonable implementation, but there's no reason\nto \"only allow\" this implementation.\n\n   (B) Allow baselining of arbitrary collections, but capture relevant\n   namespace information along with the version selector.  For\n   example, the DAV:version-set might instead contain (path, version)\n   pairs: <version-set> <item> <href>file1</href>\n   <href>http://example.org/vers/vh1/v1</href> </item> This would\n   supports a weaker notion of \"restore\" for non-versioned collections\n   with versioned members; it would allow these non-versioned\n   collections to be re-created when the baseline is restored,\n   although they would not be restored with any of their dead\n   properties.\n\nThis is certainly another reasonable implementation, but again, not\nsomething we should require.\n\n   Approach (B) feels more general, and allows baselines to be offered\n   by a server that does not offer versioned collections (e.g.,\n   something like CVS). Moreover, the additional information captured\n   in the baseline should not represent a significant burden for\n   servers planning to offer both baseline and versioned collections.\n\nThis information could be expensive to compute for certain\nimplementations.

Some\nimplementations will want to defer computing the DAV:version-set until\nthe CHECKIN operation, while others will use the DAV:version-set to\ndynamically track the current targets.  Requiring one way or the other\nwould be a problem for one implementation or the other.  A client that\nwants this information can either look at the DAV:checked-out\nbaseline, or do a PROPFIND for DAV:target, so there is no need for\nthis information to be retrieved from the checked out version\nselector.\n\n   It also needs to be specified whether the DAV:version-set property\n   of a checked-out baseline selector is updated live as the baselined\n   collection is modified; i.e., can I query the DAV:version-set\n   property of a checked-out baseline selector at any time to discover\n   a perfectly accurate picture of the baseline collection?\n\nSee above.\n\n   - Needs to specify the semantics of checking-out a baseline\n   version.

But perhaps someone has a counterexample.\n\nSure, I've got some (:-).\n\nSuppose your implementation uses versioned collections, and the only\nway that you can reconstruct the namespace information is by\ninstantiating all the collection versions in a workspace, and seeing\nwhat namespace results.  This is not a cheap operation, and\nraises various ugly implementation questions about how long you should\nkeep that workspace around (is the next request going to require the\nsame info?).\n\nOr suppose your implementation uses a \"delta\" format to just store\nwhich versions have been added/deleted from a particular predecessor\nbaseline.  You can rapidly find out the names of the added versions,\nbut it is costly to find out the names of all the versions.\n\n   I agree that the minimal requirements are \"restore\" and \"merge\".\n   (A hard-nosed person would observe that the DAV:version-set\n   property is not required to meet either of these requirements.)\n   But it feels like the DAV:version-set property is currently a\n   half-measure; the information is of little use without the\n   corresponding namespace info, which we know every implementation\n   has in some form.\n\nI'd be happy to get rid of DAV:version-set.  In fact, in an earlier\nthread, the cost of computing and passing DAV:version-set was raised,\nwhen you have, for example, a few hundred thousand resources in the\ncollection being baselined.  We never did address that concern ...\nperhaps now is the time to do so, i.e. shall we just axe\nDAV:version-set for a baseline?\n\n   The advantage of revealing the namespace info in addition to the\n   version selection is that it makes it possible for a client to\n   query a baseline and reconstruct the resource\n   tree---client-side---without having to create any new objects on\n   the server.\n\nThis approach would not scale.  If the baseline contains hundreds of\nthousands of resources, the client and server would be completely\nbogged down trying to generate and process the XML.\n\n   Currently, the only way to reconstruct the resource tree for\n   browsing purposes requires read-write access.

DAV4J will \neventually be moved off the alphaWorks site, so update you links to the \nnew developerWorks site.\n\nAlthough DAV4J is hosted under the open source zone on developerWorks, IBM \nis not creating an Open Source project for DAV4J at this time. We are only \nmaking the source available to help support the WebDAV community through:\n\n    - an offering to promote the development of the WebDAV grounded in the \n\n      reality of an implementation\n    - a platform for easily exploring the WebDAV protocol and \nimplementation \n      options as it evolves\n    - feedback to the WebDAV working groups based on real implementation\n      experience\n    - a client API that facilitates WebDAV client application development\n    - a server architecture supporting multiple repository managers\n    - an implementation based on the Java and servlet standards supporting \n\n      WebDAV methods in many current Web servers\n\nIBM is also participating in the Apache/mod_dav Open Source effort, and \nincludes mod_dav in the IBM HTTP server (which is Apache). See \nwww.webdav.org for details. I (Jim Amsden) will be monitoring the DAV4J \nmailing list, and will consider updates, bug fixes, new features, etc., \ntime permitting.\nThe DAV4J client API provides Java client applications with a simple, rich \ninterface for accessing resources managed by a WebDAV server. Using this \nAPI, client applications are relieved from managing the details of the low \nlevel HTTP communication protocol, constructing and parsing XML request \nand response entity bodies, and the complexities of the WebDAV semantics. \nDAV4J also provides a servlet that with WebSphere AppServer extends the \nApache Web server with the WebDAV Class 2 protocol. \nDAV4J provides: \n\n1. Protocol independent (not just WebDAV) communication between client and \nserver applications including support for http:, rmi:, and local access. \nSupport for iiop: may be provided in a future release. Local access is \nused if the host name in the URL is the local host and no port is \nspecified.\\\n \n2. A high-level, object-oriented interface capturing the WebDAV Class 2 \nsemantics that can interface with any WebDAV Class 2 compliant server. \n\n3. A Java servlet that along with WebSphere AppServer enables DAV Class 2 \nmethods in the Apache Web server. The Apache Web server can be configured \nso that some URLs can be handled either directly by the Apache server \nwithout WebDAV methods while other URLs are handled by the DAV4J servlet \nwith WebDAV methods. This allows a single Apache server to be both a \nproduction and authoring server on different partitions of the URL \nnamespace. \n\n4. The ability to access multiple back end repository managers using a \nsingle, common, standard, simple protocol: WebDAV. The DAV4J architecture \nencapsulates low-level repository services required to implement the \nWebDAV semantics into a number of simple Java interfaces. All that is \nrequired to provide WebDAV access to a repository manager is to implement \nthese interfaces on the repository manager. DAV4J includes a repository \nmanager based on the local file system as a reference implementation and \nexample of how to integrate a repository manager. \n\n5. Platform independent, 100% pure Java portability. \nDAV4J consists of the DAV4J client API, the DAV4J servlet, and the file \nsystem repository manager. By changing a few simple properties, Web \nservers supporting servlets can be configured to support WebDAV methods. \nThe distribution includes configuration information for the Apache Web \nserver and IBM WebSphere AppServer.

I just need it to establish a spot where I can create\nnew members/sub-collections. If I want to reach an existing child resource,\nthen I'll go through version selectors (to their versions, which I CHECKOUT,\nand then to their working resources).\n\n\nI think the point here is that I'm working in a transactional / change set\nmodel here.

When I discussed/asked-for-clarification-on some of this on the list\n   a month or two ago, that was the point of view that I understood.\n\nVersioned collections are significantly more complicated than other\nversioned resources because of the interactions between the collection\nversions and the collection member versions.  So although working\n(non-collection) resources are quite reasonable, working collections\nare quite problematic.  In particular, what kind of resources are members\nof a working collection, and especially, what kind of resources are\nthe members that themselves are collections?   Version selectors do\nnot have this problem, because you have a tree of version selectors\n(i.e. members of version selectors are other version selectors),\nunlike the \"free floating\" working collections, whose members are ???\n\n   And more\n   specifically, I didn't like some the semantics attached to checking out a\n   version selector, so I was making sure that a checkout on a version was\n   possible, and that operations could be done that way.\n\nAs I recall, the semantics you didn't like was that you'd have to have\nyour own tree of version selectors (since you can't check out somebody\nelse's version selector that is already checked out to them).  But if\nyou've got versioned collections, it's natural to get some kind of\ntree when you checkout the collection, so it might as well be a tree\nof version selectors.\n\n   > A collection version only has bindings to version histories\n   > (section 12.6).

I don't see anything in the spec that says it must be\n      otherwise.\n\nThe activity part is orthogonal.  It's the collection containing the\nrequest-URL of the PUT that is important.  If the collection is a \ncollection version, the PUT fails.  If the collection is a collection\nversion selector, the PUT succeeds and creates a new (non-versioned)\nresource (which your server can automatically put under version control\nif it wishes).\n\n   2) Yes, it becomes version-controlled, as that is the behavior that my\n      server imposes when a resource is PUT there. This is allowed by the spec.\n\nWhen something becomes version-controlled, it becomes a version\nselector.  If you were using version selectors, this would all be\nconsistent (i.e. you'd be creating a new version selector\nas a member of an existing version selector).  If you are using\nworking collections, we'd have to define the semantic interactions\nof version selectors nested within working collections.  This becomes\ncomplex because working resources are deleted when they are checked\nin, while version selectors are not.  So if you check in a working\ncollection, what happens to the possibly checked-out version selectors\ninside that working collection?  With collection version selectors,\nthis is not an issue because they are not deleted when you check them\nin so that nested version selectors do not get orphaned by checkin.\n\n   3) At MERGE time, a version history is created for the PUT'd resource and a\n      new collection version is created which references that.\n\nMERGE modifies the properties of existing version selectors\n(e.g. DAV:target and DAV:merge-predecessor-set), but\ndoes not create any new versions (only CHECKIN does that).\n\n   >     <Greg>\n   >     or even:\n   >         COPY http://host.name/repo/somedir/foo.c\n   >         Destination: http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3/foo.c\n   >     </Greg>\n   > \n   > <tim>\n   > This would also be a violation of the semantics of versioned\n   > collections since the source is not a version history -- and even\n   > if you did attempt to copy a version history over that would fail\n   > with </DAV:cannot-copy-history> (Section 15.7) <g>\n   > </tim>\n\nYes, if working collections had version histories as members.\n\n   Aah, bunk. I'm copying into a working resource for the versioned\n   collection.  I can do whatever I'd like at that point.\n\nYes, if working collections are more like checked-out collection\nversion selectors, but in that case, we would have to decide what\nexactly can be members of working collections (e.g. version\nselectors?).  Because of the problems with checking in working\ncollections that have version selector members, it would be much\nsimpler to just use collection version selectors.\n\n   And the\n   source implicitly identifies a version history, so the fancy\n   wording / semantics about \"collections only containing versioned\n   collections\" can easily be handled at MERGE time.\n\nSince MERGE just modifies version selector properties, it doesn't give\nyou an opportunity to introduce version histories.\n\n   Hell, the model about a versioned collection only referring to version\n   histories is just so much baloney to me. I have a collection. I want to copy\n   something into it. Great. I make it work.\n\nWe need to avoid the ambiguous term \"versioned collection\" (I believe\nTim is the culprit in this instance :-).  In particular, it is baloney\nto say that a collection version selector only contain version histories,\nbut it is true that collection *versions* can only contain version\nhistories.\n\n   Describe it how you want, but it is still going to work as any rational\n   person is going to expect: check out the collection, copy something in, then\n   merge that back.\n\nI'm with you on the \"checkout\" and \"copy into\", but that needs to be\nfollowed by a \"checkin\", not a MERGE.\n\n   > <tim>\n   > It is unnecessary to CHECKOUT the thing being DELETEd since it is not\n   > modified by the DELETE method, only the parent collection is modified (by\n   > loosing an internal member).\n   > </tim>\n\n   That may be strictly true, but if I check out a collection into a working\n   resource, then I don't necessarily have each of the members defined to be\n   available below that working resource.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"have\".  The collection knows its members.\nIf you delete one, the server knows what to delete, without you needing\nto have anything beyond the collection.\n\n   Therefore, how would I identify which\n   resource to delete, with respect to that checked out collection.\n\nThe name (URL) of the resource includes both the collection (lop off\nthe last segment of the URL) and which member of that collection is\nto be deleted (identified by the last segment of the URL).  That\nfully identifies the resource to be deleted.\n\n   I guess it would be possible to DELETE the version selector, have the server\n   identify the parent, see that a working resource is available, and then go\n   and modify that working resource. Hrm. I'll have to think about that.\n\nYou can only DELETE the version selector if it is checked out\n(which is what I'd want you to do, so actually I'm all for that :-).\nIf we are going to support working collections, the DELETE would have\nto be issued against the working collection member.  But that tells\nthe server all it needs to know.\n\n   > <tim>\n   > The operations you describe are more appropriate to a checked out\n   > collection version selector; and I agree that they are essential.\n   > </tim>\n\n   A working resource is a working resource. It shouldn't matter whether it\n   came from a checked out version selector or a checked out version.\n\nWell, to be precise, the result of checking out a version selector is a\nchecked out version selector, not a working resource (you only get a\nworking resource by checking out a version).  A working resource has\nsome very different behavior from a checked out version selector.\nIn particular, checking in a working resource deletes the working resource,\nwhile checking in a checked out version selector just changes its state\nfrom checked out to checked in.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-12586234"}, {"subject": "Re: Working collection", "content": "On Sat, Nov 18, 2000 at 04:47:56PM -0500, Geoffrey M.

Illegal under Model A\n   since the source is not a version history.\n\n2) a version selector: same as (1), however the parent collection (if\n   versioned) must be checked out or auto-versioned.\n\n3) a working resource: same as (2)\n\n4) a version history: allowed under Model A, assuming the parent collection\n   is checked out or auto-versioned.

I also find it a bit\nweird to move a *history*. I'm really trying to move a version selector for\nthat history. Not to mention the fact that, typically, a version history is\nlocated in some server-controlled namespace; the semantics of that namespace\nwould probably disallow a version history to be moved from it, or for a\nversion history to exist outside of it (e.g. under the working resource).\n\nConcretely: Subversion has several server-defined namespaces. One each for\nactivities, working resources, versions, and histories. The history\nresources cannot be moved out of their space. And since a checked-out\ncollection (whether a checked-out version selector, or a working resource\ncorresponding to a checked-out selector or version) exists *outside* of the\nhistory namespace, then it is illegal to move a version history.\n\nIf any server uses server-defined namespaces for histories, then a MOVE\nwould be impossible if you tried to enforce \"working collections must\ncontain version histories.\"\n\n>    The working resource for the collection is also handy for deleting or for\n>    replacing the collection:\n> \n>        DELETE http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3\n>        (note that this request also requires a checked-out parent)\n> \n> This is fine.\n\nNote that Tim also pointed out that we probably would not delete the working\ncollection itself, but delete the member from the parent collection.

But all other operations: PUT, PROPFIND, etc work the same for a\nchecked-out version selector and a working resource, right? You can still do\nall the same stuff to it.

What would be the justification\n   for such a difference?\n\nA checked-out (non-collection) version selector is very similar to\na (non-collection) working resource.  The main difference is that \nthe working resource is deleted when it is checked in, while the\nversion selector is not.  \n\nFor collection version selectors, the model is relatively simple ...\na collection version selector has as members other version selectors\n(possibly other collection version selectors), as well as non-versioned\nmembers.  So a collection version selector is the root of a tree of\nversion selectors (and possibly non-versioned resources).\n\nIn contrast, it sounds like you want a collection working resource\n(aka a \"working collection\") to not be a tree, which would make a\nworking collection very different from a checked out collection\nversion selector.\n\n   Doing a check-out in place does not work well for me. I want to construct an\n   activity, check out a bunch of things w.r.t. that activity, make the\n   changes, then merge the activity in one fell swoop. That model works great,\n   and I don't see any incentive/benefit to using a different model.\n   [ I will admit to not reading the latest incarnation of workspaces, but it\n     still seems moot if the activity model and working resources satisifies my\n     problems ]\n\nIf you only checkout leaf (i.e. non-collection) resources, that works\nfine, but as soon as you want to track the history of the collections,\nyou need to decide what kind of resource are the members of the checked\nout collections.  That's where I believe that the notion of a working\ncollection either falls apart, or at least, becomes quite complex.\n\nAll that the \"in-place\" checkout requires is that you precede your\nwork with a single MKWORKSPACE request, that simply tells the server\n\"this is the root of the tree of resources I'm going to be mucking with\".\nIf the client is going to be versioning collections, it needs to know\nthat anyway, and it seems reasonable to have it issue the single MKWORKSPACE\nrequest before it checks out its first collection.\n\n   In the model that I'm going to use, I don't need to \"slash-through\" the\n   working collection. I just need it to establish a spot where I can create\n   new members/sub-collections.\n\nIt's the semantics of those new members/sub-collections that is the\ntricky part.  What if you MOVE some existing version-controlled\nresources into the working collection, checkout some of the existing\nmembers of the working collection, and create new members.  All of\nthese have to be modeled in a way that allows the server at checkin\ntime to decide what version histories should be associated with what\nnames in the new version of the collection.\n\n   If I want to reach an existing child resource,\n   then I'll go through version selectors (to their versions, which I CHECKOUT,\n   and then to their working resources).\n\nSo when you checkout an existing child resource of a working collection,\nhow is this reflected in the state of that working collection?  What happens\nif you delete a  checked-out child of that working collection?  Does that\ndelete the working resource, or is it still around but invisible when\nyou check it in?  One can probably create answers to these things,\nbut it won't be simple.\n\n   I think the point here is that I'm working in a transactional / change set\n   model here. I get a bunch of working resources, change them, then check them\n   in in one fell swoop. Navigation and management of checked out resources is\n   minimal and short-lived. Give me a working resource, I'll tweak in, then\n   merge it back in (possibly with other changes).\n\nIt's capturing the namespace changes (i.e. the changes to the collections)\nthat is the challenge.  You need to distinguish between new members being\nadded, existing members being renamed, existing members being replaced\nby new members, and existing members being replaced by members from other\ncollections.  A tree of version selectors can handle this, and I would\nregret adding significant complexity to the protocol just to provide an\nalternative way of doing it.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-12636828"}, {"subject": "Re: VERSION-CONTROL on an existing resourc", "content": "   From: Greg Stein <gstein@lyra.org>\n\n   On Sat, Nov 18, 2000 at 10:38:49AM -0500, Geoffrey M.

Of these, I'd rather take the flexibility of Model B.\n\nGreat, now we're on the same chapter of the same book (:-).\n\n   Concretely: Subversion has several server-defined namespaces. One each for\n   activities, working resources, versions, and histories.\n\nThat corresponds precisely to what is currently in the protocol.\nIn fact, the protocol has just one additional namespace: workspaces\n(where a workspace is really just a root for a tree of version selectors).\n\n   The history resources cannot be moved out of their space.\n\nThe protocol has this restriction as well.  Note that if you support\ncollection versions, that a history resource has multiple names\n(multiple bindings).  In particular, it has its name in the \"history\nnamespace\", but it also has names in the \"version namespace\".\nFor example, if http://gmc.repo/his/id73 identifies a history\nresource, and http://gmc.repo/ver/c23 is a collection version with\na member named \"foo.html\" that identifies this history resource,\nthen http://gmc.repo/his/id73 and http://gmc.repo/ver/c23/foo.html\nare two names for the same history resource, one in the history\nnamespace and the other in the version namespace.\n\n   If any server uses server-defined namespaces for histories, then a MOVE\n   would be impossible if you tried to enforce \"working collections must\n   contain version histories.\"\n\nI don't think working collections should contain version histories,\nbut I'll point out that you could allow version histories to be\nmoved around in the \"working collection\" namespace, even though you\ncan't move them around in the \"history\" namespace.\n\n   >    The working resource for the collection is also handy for\n   >    deleting or for replacing the collection:\n   > \n   >        DELETE http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3\n   >        (note that this request also requires a checked-out parent)\n   > \n   Note that Tim also pointed out that we probably would not delete the working\n   collection itself, but delete the member from the parent collection. The\n   above request is ambiguous with \"do an UNCHECKOUT\".\n\nOops, I didn't read this carefully in my first response.  UNCHECKOUT\n(as currently defined) only applies to a checked out version selector.\nYou just DELETE a working resource if you don't want it any\nmore. (i.e. don't want to check it in).  So the above request is not\nambiguous with \"do an UNCHECKOUT\", but rather *is* the way you tell\nthe server that you no longer are interested in that working resource.\n(And the parent, \"http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk\" is not under version\ncontrol, and therefore does not have to be checked out prior to the\ndeletion.\n\nOn the other hand, \n\n DELETE http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3/foo.html\n\nis the way that you delete the member named \"foo.html\" from the\nchecked out collection.\n\n   I'm still a bit woozy on deletion of resources, both in WebDAV and DeltaV.\n   In WebDAV, you lock and delete the target.\n\nI don't see any reason to lock the target of a DELETE (the lock is\njust blown away by the DELETE).  I'd just issue the DELETE.\n\n   In DeltaV, do we checkout the\n   target to make sure we are allowed to delete it? (e.g. watch out for\n   reserved checkouts and stuff).\n\nThere's no reason to checkout a resource before deleting it.\nThe deletion is a modification to the collection containing\nthe resource, not to the resource itself.  A checkout of a\nresource (reserved or not) has no effect on whether or not\nyou can delete it.\n\n   I'm tempted to just say \"check out both of them, then delete relative to the\n   parent collection\".  (sigh... but checking out the target is probably\n   redundant, then) ... Ideas, anyone?\n\nJust repeat the mantra \"a delete is an operation on the parent collection\nof a resource\", and all will be well (:-).\n\n   >        COPY http://host.name/repo/somedir/\n   >        Destination: http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3\n   >        Overwrite: T\n   > \n   > This wouldn't work, because deleting a working resource (as is done by\n   > an Overwrite:T) cancels the checkout.

You know what I meant, and the server really should, too.\n   This is where people read the letter of the law too strictly and\n   screw up clients because the client wasn't as anal as the server.\n\nWell, the server knows what you said (i.e. \"get rid of the working\nresource thereby canceling the checkout\"), and it's really important\nthat the client and the server agree on this (or else the client will\nbe surprised by what the server ends up doing, because it will do what\nthe client said, not what it meant).\n\n   But for discussion. Sure... let's assume that I used \"update\" in there.\n   The point is that I need to check out the collection because I'm about to\n   replace its contents.\n\nIf you are going to modify it's contents (i.e. add/delete/change a\nmember), then sure, you need to check it out.  But if you are going\nto delete the collection, then you are operating on the *parent*\nof the collection, i.e. deleting a member of the parent of the\ncollection, so it is the *parent* that needs to be checked out for\nthe DELETE.\n\n   >    DELETE of a member is a CHECKOUT of two items: the thing to\n   >    DELETE and the parent collection.\n   > \n   > Only the parent collection needs to be checked-out in order to\n   > DELETE a member of that collection.\n\n   Yah, this was my rambling above. What about reserved checkouts and stuff for\n   the member? e.g. is it possible to just delete the thing without having it\n   checked out?\n\nYes.  Checking something out prior to deleting it is as unnecessary as\nlocking it before deleting it.

Use VERSION-CONTRL? And just how do I get that to\n   participate within an activity? Or to MERGE it? etc\n\nThe version selector created by VERSION-CONTROL has all the activity\nbehavior that a working resource has.  When you check it out, the\nDAV:activity-set of the version selector is set to be the specified\nactivity(s), and when you check it in, the new version is added to the\nDAV:version-set of the activity.\n\n   > This would allow us to avoid all the extra complexity that would\n   > result from having two ways to manipulate versioned collections.\n\n   I'm not seeing the complexity. Check out a collection version; you get a\n   working collection; modify it at will; check it in.\n   The working collection operates just the same as a checked-out collection\n   version selector. And this is right: they're both representative of a\n   checked-out [collection] resource. Seemed pretty obvious to me.\n\nIf we make working collections act like checked-out collection version\nselectors, then I agree that we can avoid the complexity.  It appears\nthat the main question we have to resolve is what precisely are the\nmembers of a working collection.  If they are version selectors, then\nwe are almost there, since the working collection then just becomes\nthe root of a tree of version selectors.  The only thing left to do\nto unify the models is to make the root *also* be a version selector,\nand then we have a uniform tree of version selectors.\n\nWhich is a good transition into your next message:\n\n   From: Greg Stein <gstein@lyra.org>\n\n   > But if you've got versioned collections, it's natural to get some\n   > kind of tree when you checkout the collection, so it might as\n   > well be a tree of version selectors.\n\n   Yes.

Or perhaps more\nimportantly, why were you planning on introducing such a limitation?\nIf the working collection creates a tree of version selectors, why not\njust use those version selectors (which are local to you, and therefore\nwon't be checked out by anyone else) for versioning operations on those\nmembers?\n\nThe model then becomes: Check-out a collection (which then creates\na tree of version selectors), and then checkout one of those version\nselectors when you want to change that member of the tree.\n\n   In my model, if the parent is a working collection, then the PUT\n   [into the working collection] succeeds and becomes a working\n   resource. (and an analogous behavior for MKCOL)\n\nTo be careful about terminology, it becomes a version selector, not\na working resource, since auto-versioning creates version selectors,\nnot working resources.  (You indicate as much below, so this is just\nme being pedantic :-).\n\n   >    Yes, it becomes version-controlled, as that is the behavior\n   >    that my server imposes when a resource is PUT there.

Kind of mandatory :-)\n\nWell, one could invent a new kind of resource for this, but using\nversion selectors would certainly keep the model simpler.\n\n   > this would all be\n   > consistent (i.e. you'd be creating a new version selector\n   > as a member of an existing version selector).\n\n   Assuming auto-versioning, then yes. The net result is a new version\n   selector.\n\nOK, we're in good shape then.\n\n   > If you are using\n   > working collections, we'd have to define the semantic interactions\n   > of version selectors nested within working collections.\n\n   Unless you state that a PUT/MKCOL creates a working resource within the\n   working collection.\n\nThat would not work very well, since when you checkin a working resource,\nit is deleted, which is not the behavior you would want (it would make\nit appear that you wanted to delete that member of the working collection).\n\n   [ and thus: they also create a version history; not sure when a version\n     would be created, though ??? ]\n\nWhen you first create a version history, it is given an initial version.\nWhen you put an existing (non-versioned) resource under version control,\nthe initial version is a copy of the state of the non-versioned resource.\n\n   > This becomes\n   > complex because working resources are deleted when they are checked\n   > in, while version selectors are not.  So if you check in a working\n   > collection, what happens to the possibly checked-out version selectors\n   > inside that working collection?\n\n   Yes, this could be complicated :-). You could say that they just continue to\n   hang out, but what does the parent collection (the working collection that\n   you checked in) become? You can't just get rid of it because of the\n   namespace consistency issue.\n\nYes.  This is why checked-out version selectors are preferable for\ncollections, because when you checkin a checked-out version selector,\nit just becomes a checked-in version selector, and all of its members\nare still visible and accessible.\n\n   > With collection version selectors,\n   > this is not an issue because they are not deleted when you check them\n   > in so that nested version selectors do not get orphaned by checkin.\n\n   Yup. But checked-out version selectors are not \"thread safe\" if you will :-)\n\nRemember that you got \"your own\" tree of version selectors when you\nchecked out the desired collection.  So nobody else is checking out\nyour version selectors (they'd be checking out *their* version selectors,\nthat were created when they did *their* checkout of the collection).\n\nSo the only constraint here is that you can't checkout the same resource\ntwice at the same time yourself, without first creating a new tree\nof version selectors, but that seems like a pretty reasonable\n(and perhaps even desireable) restriction.\n\n   >    3) At MERGE time, a version history is created for the PUT'd resource and a\n   >       new collection version is created which references that.\n   > \n   > MERGE modifies the properties of existing version selectors\n   > (e.g. DAV:target and DAV:merge-predecessor-set), but\n   > does not create any new versions (only CHECKIN does that).\n\n   Euh... when did that happen? Damn.\n\nWell, actually, it's always been that way.\n\n   Just how is a transacted change set supposed to happen, then?\n   Before, it was \"accumulate the changes into an activity, then merge\n   the activity.\" What now?\n\nI'd support the introduction of the ability to CHECKIN an activity,\nto mean \"atomically checkin all checked-out resources for that\nactivity\".  Does anyone object?  (pretty sneaky burying this\nquestion deep in this long message ... :-).\n\n   > ... Because of the problems with checking in working\n   > collections that have version selector members, it would be much\n   > simpler to just use collection version selectors.\n\n   So the issue isn't about \"what goes into a working collection\" as much as\n   \"what happens when you check it in?\"\n\nOr \"can we just use collection version selectors, since they already\nhave the appropriate behavior on checkin?\"\n\n   Getting all academic with this-contains-that just peeves me. The\n   goal is to make things work, rather than have a pure model that\n   doesn't work.\n\nWell, collections are all about what contains what, so I believe that\n\"making things work\" for version-controlled collections hinges on\ngetting the \"what contains what\" questions answered rigorously.\n\n   >    Describe it how you want, but it is still going to work as any\n   >    rational person is going to expect: check out the collection,\n   >    copy something in, then merge that back.\n\n   > I'm with you on the \"checkout\" and \"copy into\", but that needs to be\n   > followed by a \"checkin\", not a MERGE.\n\n   Can I do a CHECKIN on an activity?\n   I see no other way to create a transacted change set.\n\nI agree that having a transacted change set is an important\ncapability, and that doing a CHECKIN on an activity is the\nright way to model it.  I'll raise this in a separate mail\nmessage (for those that didn't make it all the way into\nthis one :-).\n\n   If you check out '/some/collection/' into a working collection, then\n   /working/collection/foo.html' may not be available.\n   In truth, I'll probably make the URL available for DELETE, but nothing else.\n   You'd need to go to the version (selector) to refer to the contents.\n\nThat seems like an unnecessary complication to the model ... you can\nremove this restriction, and the model becomes simpler, and the clients\nlife becomes simpler as well.\n\n   >    I guess it would be possible to DELETE the version selector,\n   >    have the server identify the parent, see that a working\n   >    resource is available, and then go and modify that working\n   >    resource.

The \"it\" I was\nreferring to (that must be checked out) was the parent collection that\ncontains the version selector.\n\n   And if I check out the target and DELETE that, then that is just an\n   UNCHECKOUT, right?\n\nYes.\n\n   Hmm. The spec is totally silent on deleting any of the new resource types.\n   What happens when you delete an activity? a working resource? a workspace?\n\nGood point.  There are things that we should say here about what happens\nto references to those objects when you delete them.

But all other operations: PUT, PROPFIND, etc work the same for a\n   checked-out version selector and a working resource, right? You can still do\n   all the same stuff to it. A CHECKIN treats them a bit different, but they\n   seem pretty much the same otherwise.\n\nThat would depend on how we are handling \"working collections\".\nEarlier, you were suggesting that we only allow DELETE on members\nof working collections, and not PROPFIND, CHECKOUT, etc.  If so,\na working collection would be very different from a checked out\ncollection version selector.  But I believe that the checked out\ncollection version selector semantics are the ones that we want,\nso we should use those.\n\nOne way to think about this is that I'm suggesting that checking\nout a collection version should create a workspace (i.e. a tree\nof version selectors), or in other words, that a working collection\nis a workspace.  In fact, I'd be happy to allow you to create a\nworkspace by issuing a checkout against a collection version.\n\nThe only difference between such a workspace and one that was created\nby a MKWORKSPACE is that the server selects the name for the workspace,\nwhile with a MKWORKSPACE, the client specifies the name for the workspace.\n\nSo, if we say that you can CHECKOUT a collection version to create\na workspace, and you can CHECKIN an activity to get transactioning,\nwould you have what you need?\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-12657178"}, {"subject": "Atomic CHECKIN of all checkouts of an activit", "content": "Greg has asked for the ability to tell the server that he wants\nall checkouts against an activity to be checked in atomically.\n\nA natural way to marshall this would be to allow CHECKIN to be\napplied to an activity (since activities cannot be versioned,\nthis is unambiguous).

If you delete a version history,\n   then I'd expect the corresponding selectors and versions to become\n   non-controlled resources.\n\nI think that's something we need to leave up to the server implementor,\nsince I don't think we will be able to agree on this.\n\n   But even then, it seems that you could lose all the information on how to\n   track down the available versions for a given resource.\n   (of course, I'd expect most servers to just refuse deletion of versions and\n    version histories, but the spec may not be able to make that assumption;\n    hmm.

Those versions are not (necessarily) associated with a particular\ntarget or a baseline. This means that we cannot issue a simple SET-TARGET or\nMERGE or anything to prepare the working collection (or workspace, if you\nwill).\n\nInstead, the model will be:\n\n    CHECKOUT /repo/$svn/ver/5/some/collection\n    (modify the thing)\n    \n    CHECKOUT /repo/$svn/ver/7/some/collection/some-file\n    (modify the thing)\n\n[ the URLs above are not representative of SVN's actual URLs, but changed to\n  make their intent clear ]\n\nThus, I would be working with two unrelated working resources, rather than\nin children of the working collection.\n\nAt another point, I had stated that I didn't want to create a \"tree\"\nunderneath the working collection, and how I was thinking of accomplishing\nthat. Pretty simple: return 404 for resources under the working collection.\nOnly a DELETE would be allowed for immediate members of a working\ncollection.\n\nIf you do a PUT or a MKCOL to a member of a working collection, then a new\nworking resource will be created, and that URL will be returned in the 201\n(Created) response's Location: header.

After you create a workspace, then it must get populated with the\nresources that you want to work with. So wouldn't that be something like:\n\n    MKWORKSPACE /some/whwere\n    COPY /repos  -> /some/where/repos\n\nAnd then you start working with /some/where/repos ? Ooh, and the client also\nhas to make sure the result of the COPY actually creates version selectors,\ndoesn't it?\n\nHmm. I guess you could use VERSION-CONTROL instead of COPY to set up the\nworkspace contents. But... it isn't a simple matter of \"just create a\nworkspace\".\n\n>    In the model that I'm going to use, I don't need to \"slash-through\" the\n>    working collection.

Per\nRFC 2616, I must return a Location: header with \"the most specific URI for\nthe resource\". That URI will refer to the new working resource, and will\n*NOT* be a child of the working collection.\n\n>    If I want to reach an existing child resource,\n>    then I'll go through version selectors (to their versions, which I CHECKOUT,\n>    and then to their working resources).\n> \n> So when you checkout an existing child resource of a working collection,\n> how is this reflected in the state of that working collection?\n\nThe child resource isn't present in the working collection, so a change is\nnot required.\n\n> What happens\n> if you delete a  checked-out child of that working collection?

So, the commit would fail.\n\n[ commit meaning a CHECKIN of the related activity, workspace, whatever ]\n\n> One can probably create answers to these things,\n> but it won't be simple.\n\nWell, the hardest part is whether it is reasonable to say that a working\ncollection does not report any members. Or maybe it does, but when you try\nto access them, you get a redirect. Or the working collection reports them\nin a PROPFIND (but returns a 409 (Conflict) if you try to fetch any\nproperties) but the resource returns a 404.\n\nIf the \"no member\" working collection is possible, then we may be okay.\n\n>    I think the point here is that I'm working in a transactional / change set\n>    model here.

At any point in the tree, you would\nneed to figure out which is checked out, which is not. If something is\nchecked out, then what version? And as you pointed out in another note, what\nis the target of each version selector?

Two points in the above.\n\n1) \"When something becomes version-controlled, it becomes a version\n   selector.\" Where is that stated? VERSION-CONTROL creates one, sure. But\n   why can't my PUT create a working resource? (which implies an eventual\n   creation of a version, a version history, and a version selector as a\n   member of the collection version's extent version selectors)\n\n2) I stated that I use version selectors elsewhere. But the point at hand\n   really seems to refer to what is inside the working collection.\n\n>...\n>    > If you are using\n>    > working collections, we'd have to define the semantic interactions\n>    > of version selectors nested within working collections.\n> \n>    Unless you state that a PUT/MKCOL creates a working resource within the\n>    working collection.\n> \n> That would not work very well, since when you checkin a working resource,\n> it is deleted, which is not the behavior you would want (it would make\n> it appear that you wanted to delete that member of the working collection).\n\nAgreed.\n\nI resolved this problem when I realized (last night) that I could use the\nLocation: header in the 201 response to put the new working resources\nanywhere I want (rather than under the working collection).\n\n>    [ and thus: they also create a version history; not sure when a version\n>      would be created, though ??? ]\n> \n> When you first create a version history, it is given an initial version.\n> When you put an existing (non-versioned) resource under version control,\n> the initial version is a copy of the state of the non-versioned resource.\n\nThat doesn't fully answer the question. The second sentence assumes that I\nhave a non-versioned resource. That step isn't possible. I must be able to\ngo from the null state to a versioned resource.\n\nI believe the answer is that a working resource might not have a\nDAV:checked-out property.\n\nHow were other people thinking of modelling the creation of a versioned\nresource?

But the target issue\nthat you raised still creates problems.

Pretty simple: return 404 for resources under the working collection.\n   Only a DELETE would be allowed for immediate members of a working\n   collection.\n\nOK, it looks like I haven't convinced you that you really want to\ncreate a logical tree on the server (aka workspace) for each user (:-).\n\nSo if we are plunging into dreaded choice C (:-), let's see if\nwe can make it as close to A or B as we can.  Since you don't want\nto create a tree of version selectors, that eliminates choice B.\nChoice A (analagous to versions) says that version controlled members\nof the collection are version histories.  This actually looks pretty\ngood, since you can't slash through version histories, they don't\ncreate a tree of version selectors, but you could delete them from\nthe working collection (you can't delete them from the version history\nnamespace, but there's nothing to stop you from deleting them from\nthe working collection namespace).\n\n   If you do a PUT or a MKCOL to a member of a working collection, then a new\n   working resource will be created, and that URL will be returned in the 201\n   (Created) response's Location: header. This allows me to avoid nesting the\n   working resources by effectively redirecting to the created working\n   resource.\n\nI have what I believe is a simpler proposal.  You can create as many\nnon-versioned resources as you want in a working collection.  When\nyou checkin a working collection, all non-versioned resources are put\nunder version control, and are replaced by their (newly created)\nversion history resource.  The \"put under version control\" works\nleafs up, so you can create trees of non-versioned resources inside\nof a working collection before checking it in.  The working collection\nis deleted on checkin, as a working resource is, but all your work is\nsaved in the standard form of versions and version histories.\n\nIf you want to subsequently checkout any of those newly versioned\nresources, you would just CHECKOUT the desired version, and get a\nworking resource just as usual.\n\n   I'm not sure how a PROPFIND on a working collection would operate, if it had\n   a non-zero depth. I might refuse them to avoid the implication that other\n   resources exist under the working collection.\n\nIf the members of a working collection are either version histories or\nnon-version-controlled resources, PROPFIND behavior would be well defined.\n\nHow's all this sound?\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\np.s.

But... it isn't a simple matter of \"just create a\n   workspace\".\n\nA single SET-TARGET call would do it (with a Depth header, for the label\ncase), so I think it's reasonable to call it \"simple\".

So, the commit would fail.\n   [ commit meaning a CHECKIN of the related activity, workspace, whatever ]\n\nThe removal of a resource from a collection is not incompatible with\nthe creation of a new version of that resource, so there is no incompatibility\nand the commit (CHECKIN) will succeed.\n\nNote that this is not a problem ... the fact that your new version is\nnot visible in the new version of the collection presents no logical\nproblems, so I just mention this to avoid any misunderstandings about\nwhat a deletion is and what a merge conflict is.\n\n   A tree of version selectors is rather difficult to maintain on the server,\n   compared to a set of working resources. At any point in the tree, you would\n   need to figure out which is checked out, which is not. If something is\n   checked out, then what version? And as you pointed out in another note, what\n   is the target of each version selector? In Subversion, I need to work with\n   specific version resources (much easier than trying to prep a version\n   selector to point at the version that I'm concerned with).\n\nIf you implement a workspace as a label and a set of working\nresources, then you just move the label whenever someone says\nSET-TARGET, and check to see if you have a working resource for that\nversion history before returning the labeled version.  You do have the\ncost of setting the labels for each workspace, but you now have all\nthe robustness/recoverability benefits of the server knowing the state\nof the client.\n\nBut I probably can live with adding the notion of a \"working collection\"\nto the protocol, if you remain unconvinced (:-).\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13037831"}, {"subject": "DeltaV BOFs in San Dieg", "content": "In addition to the official DeltaV meeting slot on Thursday, at 3:30PM, are\nthere any DeltaV BOF meetings being planned?

Because it copies all the resources\n   to the local disk and you edit them there.\n\nIf it is going to copy all of the resources to the local disk, it has\nto (at least indirectly) tell the server what versions of each resource\nit is interested in.  If it just tells the server this via a \"SET-TARGET\",\nthen the server knows everything it needs to set up the workspace for that\nclient.\n\n   When you go to do a commit, it\n   needs to work against what it copied (rather than the current target). Thus,\n   it refers to the specific version resource that was copied to the client. It\n   checks that thing out, makes the changes, and checks it in.\n\nYes!  Which is one way a workspace is useful, since it keeps track of\nwhat versions the client has downloaded, as opposed to what is currently\nin the shared \"team\" area.\n\n   > To be careful about terminology, it becomes a version selector, not\n   > a working resource, since auto-versioning creates version selectors,\n   > not working resources.\n\n   Eh? Auto-versioning is related to an automatic CHECKOUT/CHECKIN. I was\n   referring to automatically making the new resource version-controlled.\n   Further, I create a working resource for the new resource. In the 201\n   (Created), I state where the new resource's working resource is located.\n\nPoor choice of words on my part.  I was referring to the \"automatic\nputting under version control by the server\", not the \"having the\nDAV:auto-version property set\" concept.  I'll try to remember to call\nthe former \"auto-version-controlling\", and the latter\n\"auto-versioning\".\n\n   1) \"When something becomes version-controlled, it becomes a version\n      selector.\" Where is that stated? VERSION-CONTROL creates one, sure.\n\nThat's what I meant by \"becomes version-controlled\", namely, has had\nthe VERSION-CONTROL operation applied to it.  Auto-version-controlling\nbehavior by the server is defined to be identical to having the\nserver apply VERSION-CONTROL to the new resource immediately after\nit has been created.\n\n      But\n      why can't my PUT create a working resource? (which implies an eventual\n      creation of a version, a version history, and a version selector as a\n      member of the collection version's extent version selectors)\n\nThat would be a significant change to the current definition of PUT and\nthe definition of a working resource (a working resource just checks out\na version which must be in a version history).  But I think we're OK\nthere with the \"working collection can contain non-versioned resources\"\napproach, described in my prior message.\n\n   > When you first create a version history, it is given an initial version.\n   > When you put an existing (non-versioned) resource under version control,\n   > the initial version is a copy of the state of the non-versioned resource.\n\n   That doesn't fully answer the question. The second sentence assumes that I\n   have a non-versioned resource. That step isn't possible. I must be able to\n   go from the null state to a versioned resource.\n\nIf non-version-controlled members of working collections are put under\nversion control when the working collection is checked in, I believe\nthat you get what you need (and don't have to go from the null state\nto a versioned resource).\n\n   I believe the answer is that a working resource might not have a\n   DAV:checked-out property.\n\nThat significantly complicates the semantics of a working resource, which\nI'd like to avoid.\n\n   How were other people thinking of modelling the creation of a versioned\n   resource? Are people assuming that this is a non-atomic creation? (check out\n   the parent, put a resource, version-control it, check in the parent; and\n   deal with the race between the PUT and the VERSION-CONTROL when the resource\n   may not be version-controlled?)\n\nYou can just lock the resource to make sure nobody messes with it between\nthe PUT and the VERSION-CONTROL.  One reason not to allow you to version\ncontrol a \"null resource\" is that servers will often have a very different\nway of versioning things like collections from things like files, and\nwon't let you change from one to the other, and with a null resource,\na server can't guess which one it's going to be.\n\n   ...\n   This is a great model based on the discussion above. But the target issue\n   that you raised still creates problems. The whole reason that I checked out\n   a collection version in the first place was to avoid target selectors that\n   might not be targeted the way that I need them to be :-)\n\nRemember that a collection version says nothing about the targets\nof its members (it just tells you the names and version history of\neach member).  So if a target selector is not targeted the way you\nwant, you just modify the target selector ... checking out and\nchecking in the collection or any of its members\nis independent of what target is selected by a target selector.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13055963"}, {"subject": "Re: DeltaV BOFs in San Dieg", "content": "Jim,\n\nThe only announcement that I noticed is\n\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-dav-versioning/2000OctDec/0157.html\n\nRegards,\n\nTim Ellison\nJava Technology Centre, MP146\nIBM UK Laboratory, Hursley Park, Winchester, UK.\ntel: +44 (0)1962 819872  internal: 249872  MOBx: 270452\n\n\n\"Jim Whitehead\" <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu> on 2000-11-22 09:06:24 PM\n\nPlease respond to \"Jim Whitehead\" <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu>\n\nTo:   ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org\ncc:\nSubject:  DeltaV BOFs in San Diego\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the official DeltaV meeting slot on Thursday, at 3:30PM, are\nthere any DeltaV BOF meetings being planned?

If you look, for example, at implementations of RFC2518 you will\ncome to the conclusion that a lot of problems of the \"realworld\" WebDAV client\nserver communication are caused by the fact that a lot of clients and servers do\n*not*  implement the DTD of RFC 2518 exactly because they don't have to.

This is the best way to insure\nthat a protocol stays open and correct.  Any client or server can be\neasily tested for at least syntactic conformance.  This does not means\nthat every transaction must be validated, but ensuring that it can is\nimportant.\n\nOn the WebDAV list, there has been some discussion about validating XML\nfor WebDAV, for example, see\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/1999OctDec/0242.html.\nThere seemed to be some agreement that the current WebDAV specification\nuses a syntax that is well-formed, but is not suitable for XML\nvalidation, and that it would not be too hard to make WebDAV to conform\nto XML validation rules.  However, some participants did not agree on\nthe advantages of validation.\n\nInteroperability is one of the key requirement on Internet protocols for\nsupporting a heterogeneous network.  This holds true for the WWW and its\nprotocols including HTTP, WebDAV, and DeltaV.  As WebDAV matures several\nextension protocols are emerging, among them the bindings and\nredirect-reference protocols, DeltaV, the access control lists\nspecification, and the advanced collections protocol.  All these\nextension protocols contribute to the XML syntax of WebDAV.  Moreover,\nit is quite likely that vendors will introduce proprietary extensions to\nthe XML syntax.  For an idea of the extent to which this can occur, one\njust need look at the source code of the DeltaV specification at\nhttp://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-10.5.htm\nand notice all the tags inserted by Word that are not part of the HTML\nspecification.\n\nAll in all, the XML syntax of WebDAV can no longer be viewed as being\nsimple.  Validation can help us to identify bugs in WebDAV applications.\nActually, this has already help us to find some bugs in the WebDAV\nspecification itself (e.g. WebDAV issues DTD_BOOBOO, MISSING_NS_SPEC,\ncp. http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/issues.html).\nValidation may also force implementors to handle XML more carefully and\nthus improve reliability.\n\nNote that we do not want to force a WebDAV implementation to validate\nXML.  We only suggest letting the implementor decide if and when to use\nvalidation.  Currently, this is not possible without modifying an\nexisting XML parser or writing a non-conforming XML parser.  Therefore,\nwe strongly suggest to fix the WebDAV specification and its extension\nprotocols like DeltaV to conform to the XML specification--including\nXML validation.  Then an implementor may choose when to apply\nvalidation.\n\nAnother problem is to track version information about the protocols.\nThe DAV header as returned from an OPTIONS request (e.g.: \"DAV: 1, 2,\nversion-selector-checkout\") does not help at all.  However, when using\na DTD, the client and the server could agree on a protocol revision\n(or otherwise stop communication with an appropriate error message or\nlog) by using the DTD's header information.\n\n\nMaking WebDAV properties suitable for XML validation\n====================================================\n\nWebDAV currently expresses resource properties through a variety of\ntags, for example:\n\n<D:displayname xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">Hello, world!</D:displayname>\n\nIn this example, the name of the property is \"DAV:displayname\", and its\nvalue is \"Hello, world!\".  This approach has some disadvantages.\nFirst of all, if you want to list property names only, you currently\nhave to do something like:\n\n<D:displayname xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"/>\n\nBut, in an XML DTD, an element can not be defined to have empty\ncontent and non-empty content at the same time.  Hence, the way WebDAV\ncurrently handles properties is not suitable for validating XML.\nThis problem has already been discussed as anomaly in the DAV:prop\nelement usage (see\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2000JanMar/0029.html).\n\nThe simple solution here is to model the property name as an element\nattribute value or as PCDATA of a generic tag for all properties:\n\nSolution using XML attributes:\n- ------------------------------\n\n<!ELEMENT property (property-name | property-value)* >\n<!ELEMENT property-name EMPTY>\n<!ELEMENT property-value ANY>\n<!ATTLIST property-name\n          name  CDATA   #REQUIRED>\n<!ATTLIST property-value\n          name  CDATA   #REQUIRED>\n\nExample:\n\n<D:property xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n  <D:property-name name=\"displayname\"/> <!--specifying property name only-->\n  <D:property-value name=\"source\">      <!--specifying property name &\nvalue-->\n    <D:href>http://www.foo.bar</D:href>\n  </D:property-value>\n</D:property>\n\nAlternative solution without use of XML attributes:\n- ---------------------------------------------------\n\n<!ELEMENT property (property-name, property-value?)* >\n<!ELEMENT property-name (#PCDATA)>\n<!ELEMENT property-value ANY>\n\nExample:\n\n<D:property xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n  <D:property-name>displayname</D:property-name> <!--property name only-->\n  <D:property-name>source</D:property-name>      <!--property name & value-->\n  <D:property-value>\n    <D:href>http://www.foo.bar</D:href>\n  </D:property-value>\n</D:property>\n\n\nDTD for DeltaV\n==============\n\nHaving all of the above said, DeltaV should, similarly to WebDAV, of\ncourse specify an adequate DTD for all elements introduced in DeltaV.\nThe DTD need not be sent with every message.  A reference to a URL at\nwww.webdav.org would be sufficient.\n\nLabels in DeltaV\n================\n\nOne of the recent changes in DeltaV was to remove labels from the core\nversioning part and put them into the options part of the protocol.\nWe strongly suggest to undo this change.  Even if there exist two or\nthree revision control systems that do not use labels, labels are\nessential for identifying sets of associated files in a repository of\nversions.

Currently, the core part is getting smaller and smaller,\nwhile the optional part continuously grows.  The problem I see is that\nserver implementors will either implement the core part only, or, in\npractice, they will have to implement also the full optional part.\nIf, instead, a server implements the core part and only some features\nof the optional part, the client will have to figure out the server's\ncapabilities through all those DAV:supported-*-set properties.  I\nthink only very few clients will be so smart to adapt to the server's\nindividual capabilities.  Most clients probably will either rely only\non the core part or will require the full optional part.  Or, even\nworse, implementors will start to create client/server pairs with\nbuilt-in features of the optional part as needed in the specific\npair.  In either case, interoperability will tremendously suffer.\n\nI think the original idea of core/optional versioning was to separate\ncore versioning semantics from advanced semantics (mostly\nconfiguration management).  So, maybe you could reintroduce this idea\ninto the protocol by defining three levels:\n\n- core versioning: minimally required features\n\n- versioning: fully fledged versiong including labels and branches\n  (and maybe merging)\n\n- advanced versioning: configuration management and all remaining\n  optional features\n\nThis would lower the gap between the currently defined two levels und\nthus help to preserve interoperability.\n\nSection 1.3\n- ---------\n\nVersion Selector/Working Resource:\n\nThe definition of the term \"Working Resource\" as opposed to that of\n\"Version Selector\" seems confusing to me.  The pure fact that the\nCHECKOUT method is defined to be applicable on both types of\nresources, does not make them suitable for a direct comparison.  I\nthink it would be better to characterize the term \"working resource\"\nindependently from \"checking out a version selector\".  Maybe when\ndefining the term \"version selector\" you might want to add a note\nabout checking out version selectors.  To summarize, I would like to\nsuggest the following wording:\n\nVersion Selector:\nWhen an existing resource is put under version control, it becomes a\n\"version selector\" resource.  A new version history resource is\nallocated, whose initial version contains the content and dead\nproperties of the existing resource.\nA checkout may be applied to version selector.  This will make a copy\nof an existing version of the version history accessible for editing.\nA subsequent checkin will create a new version in the version history.\nChecking out a version selector is useful for environments where only\na single user accesses the version selector.\n\nWorking resource:\nIf multiple users concurrently try to check out the same version\nselector, they will interfere each other.  To avoid this, a checkout\ncan also be directly applied to a version.  This will create a new\nresource, called \"working resource\".  The working resource can be\nmodified and is automatically deleted when it is checked in.  The\nserver allocates a distinct new URL for each new working resource.\n\nSection 2: WebDAV Versioning Semantics\n- ------------------------------------\nThis section discusses rather concepts than semantics, right?\n\nSection 3: New WebDAV XML Element Attributes\n- ------------------------------------------\nAs both, the headline itself and the introductory statement to this\nsection suggest, this section should be moved to (a new revision of)\nthe WebDAV protocol.\n\nSection 4: New WebDAV Properties\n- ------------------------------\nAgain, move this to WebDAV.  Note that 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 do *not*\nintroduce new WebDAV properties, as the headline claims.\n\nSection 4.4: DAV:supported-method-set\n- -----------------------------------\n> method-name type: a type in the DAV://METHODS/ namespace\n\nIn general, this does not work.\n\nRFC 2616 says:\n\n       Method         = \"OPTIONS\"                ; Section 9.2\n                      | \"GET\"                    ; Section 9.3\n                      | \"HEAD\"                   ; Section 9.4\n                      | \"POST\"                   ; Section 9.5\n                      | \"PUT\"                    ; Section 9.6\n                      | \"DELETE\"                 ; Section 9.7\n                      | \"TRACE\"                  ; Section 9.8\n                      | \"CONNECT\"                ; Section 9.9\n                      | extension-method\n       extension-method = token\n       token          = 1*<any CHAR except CTLs or separators>\n       separators     = \"(\" | \")\" | \"<\" | \">\" | \"@\"\n                      | \",\" | \";\" | \":\" | \"\\\" | <\">\n                      | \"/\" | \"[\" | \"]\" | \"?\" | \"=\"\n                      | \"{\" | \"}\" | SP | HT\n\n\nHence, the token %XYZ& is a valid HTTP method name (even if it is\nunlikely to be ever used; but anyway...).  However,\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006 says:\n\n[4]   NameChar     ::=  Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' | ':' | CombiningChar | Extender\n[5]   Name         ::=  (Letter | '_' | ':') (NameChar)*\n[44]  EmptyElemTag ::= '<' Name (S Attribute)* S? '/>' [WFC: Unique Att Spec]\n\nThus, the Name M:%XYZ& is not a valid name for an XML tag.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer a syntax like:\n\n<D:supported-method-set xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n  <D:method-name>GET</D:method-name>\n  <D:method-name>PUT</D:method-name>\n  <D:method-name>DELETE</D:method-name>\n  <D:method-name>%XYZ&amp;</D:method-name>\n</D:supported-method-set>\n\nThis would also contribute to a clean DTD.  I think, only if you have\na very small, definitely fixed set of tokens, it may be appropriate to\ncreate tag names from the elements of this set.  But the set of HTTP\nmethod names is neither small, nor fixed.\n\nAnother important point here is that the above syntax leaves it open\nto you to add new method related features in future versions of DeltaV\nor WebDAV, e.g. something like this:\n\n<D:method-property xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n  <D:method-name>PROPFIND</D:method-name>\n  <D:property-name>maximum-supported-depth</D:property-name>\n  <D:property-value>infinity</D:property-value>\n</D:method-property>\n\nSection 4.5: DAV:supported-live-property-set\n- ------------------------------------------\nThis is another example for the anomaly in the DAV:prop element usage\n(compare\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2000JanMar/0029.html).\nThough, to correct this, WebDAV itself needs to be revised. :-(\n\nSection 4.6: DAV:supported-report-set\n- -----------------------------------\nSame problem as in section 4.5.  However, this is currently\nindependent from WebDAV and hence can and should be fixed, e.g.:\n\n<D:supported-report-set xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n  <D:report-name>version-tree-report</D:report-name>\n  <D:report-name>property-report</D:report-name>\n</D:supported-report-set>\n\nThe syntax for the request body and repsonse body for the REPORT\nmethod should be properly adapted.\n\nSection 5.1.2: DAV:predecessor-set (protected),\nSection 5.1.3: DAV:successor-set (protected)\n- ---------------------------------------------\nIt is very important that the server really maintains the order of the\nDAV:href elements, as noted for the predecessor set.  But the\nsuccessor set should also be maintained.  Think for example of\ngraphically displaying a revision graph.  You really do not want the\nbranches of the revision graph to be aligned differently each time the\ngraph is re-displayed.  Moreover, an application might want to\ndesignate the first DAV:href element of the successor set to continue\nthe main development branch.\n\nTo make the wording even clearer, I would like to suggest to change it\nas follows:\n\n  This property is an ordered set that contains a URL for each\n  predecessor of this version.\n  ...\n\n(And the same for the DAV:successor-set property.)\n\nSection 5.1.4: DAV:checkout-set (protected)\n- -------------------------------------------\nThis should also be an ordered set maintained by the server.  For\nexample, think of a client that chooses to graphically display working\nresources and checked-out version selectors as part of a revision\ngraph.  Or, to give another example, depending on the underlying\nrevision control system, the first element in the set may be a\ndesignated candidate to continue the main development branch.\n\nSection 5.1.5: DAV:checkin-date (protected)\n- -----------------------------------------\nI still vote for giving a rationale for the term \"reasonable\napproximation\".  What is the idea here?  Do you fear trouble when a\nclient checks in a revision, then reads the date, compares it to its\nlocal time and detects a clock skew?  But, anyway, why should a client\ndo that?  Or are you thinking of a distributed repository of versioned\nresources that is made accessible through an HTTP port of a single\nhost/domainname?  Checking if revision X of resource A was checked in\nlater than revision Y of resource B might become a problem if A and B\nare hosted on different machines.  Anaway, what is the rationale here?\n\nSection 5.2.3: DAV:predecessor-set\n- --------------------------------\nSame as section 5.1.2.\n\nSection 6: WebDAV Versioning and Existing Headers\n- -----------------------------------------------\nI think this headline does not express what is following.  Personally,\nI would prefer a wording like:\n\n\"Versioning Vis-a-Vis WevDAV Headers\" or\n\"Impact of Versioning on WebDAV Headers\".\n\nSection 7.1.1: Example - GET request with DAV:must-not-be-checked-out response\n- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe example contains a CHECKOUT request, not a GET request.\n\n> In this example, the request to CHECKOUT /foo.html fails because\n> /foo.html is already checked out\n\n... and /foo.html is a version selector, or because the server chooses\nnot to branch off a new version.\n\nSection 7.2: OPTIONS\n- ------------------\n> If the server supports checking out a version selector\n\ni.e. checking out a version selector is an optional feature and should\nbe moved to Optional WebDAV Versioning?\n\nSection 7.3: PUT\n- --------------\nIn the preconditions section, you use the format\n\"<DAV:some-error-tag/>: Error condition\".  To be kind,\nyou should introduce the reader to this format or use a more\nself-explanatory format.\n\nSection 7.4: PROPPATCH\n- --------------------\n> <DAV:cannot-modify-protected-property/>: An attempt to use PROPPATCH\n> to modify a property (either core or optional) defined by this\n> document as being protected MUST fail.\n\n> <DAV:cannot-modify-unsupported-property/>: An attempt to modify a\n> property defined by this document (either core or optional) whose\n> semantics are not enforced by the server MUST fail.  This helps ensure\n> that a client will be notified when it is trying to use a property\n> whose semantics are not supported by the server.\n\nWhat about moving these features to WebDAV?  They are probably of\ngeneric interest and not versioning specific (assuming that the\ndefinition of the term \"protected property\" also could be moved to\nWebDAV).\n\nSection 8: New WebDAV Methods\n- ---------------------------\nAs both, the headline itself and the introductory statement to this\nsection suggest, this section should be moved to (a new revision of)\nthe WebDAV protocol.\n\nSection 9.1: VERSION_CONTROL\n- --------------------------\nThe logical structure of the rules in this section seems rather weird\nto me.\n\nThe section contains the following precondition:\n\n> <DAV:must-be-versionable/>: The request-URL MUST identify a\n> versionable resource, a null resource, or a version selector.\n\nAccordingly, I would expect three paragraphs in the beginning of this\nsection:\n\n\"If the request-URL identifies a versionable resource, then ...\"\n\"If the request-URL identifies a null resource, then ...\"\n\"If the request-URL identifies a version selector, then ...\"\n\nA classification into disjunctive sets of cases also is probably\nless error prone.\n\nActually, in section 9.1 currently there is only a paragraph about\nversionable resources.  The second paragraph talks about the case when\nthe request *body* identifies a version.\n\nThe postconditions section, on the other hand, classifies cases\nthoroughly.  Still, I wonder which rules apply when the request-URL\nidentifies a version selector.  Section 9.1 only says that\n\n> the DAV:version-control request\n> body element MUST NOT contain a DAV:version element.\"\n(precondition)\n\nand:\n\n> If the request-URL identified a version selector at the time of the\n> request, the VERSION-CONTROL request MUST NOT change the state of that\n> version selector.\n(postcondition)\n\nBut then, what does a VERSION-CONTROL do at all if the request-URL is\na version selector?\n\nSection 9.2: CHECKOUT\n- -------------------\n> A versioning server MUST support either version selector CHECKOUT or\n> version CHECKOUT, and MAY support both.\n\nThese two concepts should be explained somewhere (e.g. in the terms\nsection or in the introductory section).  As far as I understand,\nversion selector CHECKOUT is appropriate only when a single user\naccesses a versioned resource?  And as soon as two or more users want\nto access it, you need working resources and hence have to apply\nversion CHECKOUT?  If so, this should be somewhere explained (e.g. as\nrationale or concepts, for example in the introduction).\n\nPossible you might choose leaving version selector CHECKOUT as\ncore versioning feature, but moving version CHECKOUT to optional\nversioning (preferably as part of the fully fledged versioning as\nproposed in the beginning of this mail).\n\n> The content and dead properties of the working resource MUST be the\n> same as the content and dead properties of the DAV:checked-out\n> version.\n\nI would prefer the following wording:\n\n\"The content and dead properties of the working resource MUST be\ninitialized with the content and dead properties of the\nDAV:checked-out version.\"\n\n> If DAV:apply-to-target is specified in the request body, the CHECKOUT\n> is applied to the version identified by the DAV:target of the version\n> selector, and not the version selector itself.\n\nFor better understanding, I would suggest the following wording:\n\n> If the request-URL contains a version selector and DAV:apply-to-target\n> is specified in the request body, the CHECKOUT is applied to the\n> version identified by the DAV:target of the version selector, and not\n> the version selector itself.\n\nSection 9.3: CHECKIN\n- ------------------\nThe meaning of DAV:keep-checked-out is not just to keep a checked out\nresource when applying a CHECKIN, but also to perform a subsequent\nupdate of the checked out resource's DAV:checked-out property.  As far\nas I understand, this results in a behaviour that is the same as that\nof a CHECKIN immediately followed by a CHECKOUT (except that in the\ncase of a working resource its URL is recycled).  Hence, I would\nsuggest to name this XML element e.g. \"DAV:checkpoint\" rather than\n\"DAV:keep-checked-out\".\n\nSection 9.4: UNCHECKOUT\n- ---------------------\n> An UNCHECKOUT request can be applied to a checked-out version selector\n> to cancel the CHECKOUT.\n\nThis probably should read:\n\n\"An UNCHECKOUT request can be applied to a checked-out version selector\nor working resource to cancel the CHECKOUT.\"\n\nOr should I use DELETE to cancel a version CHECKOUT (though I\npersonally would prefer UNCHECKOUT)?  If so, an appropriate note for\nthe reader should be added.\n\nSection 9.5: SET_TARGET\n- ---------------------\nTypo: \"Preconditions:\" has a boldface colon.  This occurs also in some\nother sections (e.g. 15.12, 16.1).\n\nSection 10.1: DAV:version-tree-report\n- -----------------------------------\n\n> The DAV:version-tree-report describes all the versions of the version\n> history of a version in the form of a nested tree of versions.\n\nI would prefer the following wording:\n\nThe DAV:version-tree-report describes all the descendant versions for a\ngiven version in a version history in the form of a nested tree\nof versions.\n\n> ANY value: zero or more property-name elements\n>\n> property-name type: a property type\n>\n> property-name value: none\n\nThis should be explained more verbosely.\n\n> <!ELEMENT prop (see [RFC2518], section 12.11)>\n\nArgh!  This is definitely not a valid element definition.\n\nSection 10.1.1: Example - DAV:version-tree-report\n- -----------------------------------------------\n\n>     <D:creator-displayname/>\n>\n>     <D:predecessor-set>\n>\n>   </D:version-tree-report xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n\nTypo: should be <D:predecessor-set/>\n\nSection: 16.1 LABEL\n- -----------------\n> When comparing two label names to decide if they match or not, a\n> server SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the\n> two label names.\n\nI propose to replace \"SHOULD\" with \"MUST\".  Otherwise, a client can\nnot be sure, what the server actually does and has to assume the worst\ncase, i.e. case-insensitive match.\n\n> <!ELEMENT add (label-name)>\n>\n> <!ELEMENT set (label-name)>\n\nI still think that the difference between these two elements and their\nsemantics does not get clear.\n\n> <DAV:must-be-version-or-version-selector/>: The request-URL MUST\n> identify a version or a version selector.\n\nThis probably should read:\n\n\"<DAV:must-be-version-or-version-selector-or-collection/>: The\nrequest-URL MUST identify a version or a version selector or a\ncollection.\"\n\n> <DAV:must-not-be-checked-out/>: If LABEL is being applied to a version\n> selector, it MUST NOT be checked out.\n\nThe phrase \"it MUST NOT be checked out\" is ambigous\n(noun/verb/adjective phrase or passive voice).  For clearity, what\nabout the following:\n\n\"<DAV:must-not-be-checked-out/>: Applying LABEL to a version selector\nMUST fail, if the DAV:checked-out property appears on that version\nselector.\"\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBye,\n     Juergen\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13207573"}, {"subject": "Re: Versioning TeleConf Agenda, 12/1/00 (Friday) 12-1pm ES", "content": "Minutes:\n\n   - Moving branching support from core to optional (Geoff)\n\nWe agreed that since version-checkout and version-selector-checkout\nis currently optional, it would expose a client to no more optionality\nthan is in the current protocol (but rather would make the current\noptionality more evident).

The problem I see is that\n> server implementors will either implement the core part only, or, in\n> practice, they will have to implement also the full optional part\n\nThis is an excellent segue into an issue I wanted to bring up.  The\npackaging of the protocol specification into one or more documents has been\nconsidered several times by the design team.\n\nThere are two primary options that have been discussed:\n\n1) Status-quo: describe the entire protocol, both core and advanced, in one\ndocument.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Possible increase in number of full server implementations (core +\nadvanced) of protocol\n* Reduced document overhead for boilerplate text, definitions,\nintroductions, etc.\n* Increased consistency, since all text is within a single document\n\nDisadvantages:\n* A single document is larger, and there is a perception that large protocol\nspecifications are complex.\n* A single document hides the inherent simplicity of the core versioning\nfeatures.  The simple core may be viewed as complex by its inclusion in a\nlong document.\n* Possible decrease in implementations of core features in authoring clients\n(due to perceived complexity)\n* Possible decrease in implementations of core versioning in document\nmanagement servers.\n\n2) Divide the specification into two documents, one for Core, one for\nAdvanced.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Possible increase in number of authoring client implementations, due to\nthe easily seen simplicity of the Core.\n* Possible increase in number of document management servers that implement\nCore versioning\n* It is likely Core versioning could be sent for IESG approval before the\nAdvanced document was entirely completed.\n* If interoperability problems are discovered in the Advanced features, they\ncould be fixed without impacting the specification of Core features. This\ncould lead to increased confidence in the Core features by implementors, and\nhence greater early adoption of Core features.\n\nDisadvantages:\n* Possible decrease in number of server implementations of Advanced\nfeatures.\n* Possible decrease in number of client implementations of Advanced\nfeatures.\n* Possible increase in inter-document inconsistency.\n* Repetition of defintions of terms, boilerplate text, etc.\n* Need for a document roadmap explaining subdivision of documents.\n\n\nI have long favored keeping the document together, as a whole (option #1).\nHowever, I am starting to lean towards subdividing the document (option #2).\nMy rationale is as follows:\n\n* Due to the relatively large number of optional Advanced features, there is\nsignificantly increased risk of interoperability problems in the Advanced\nportion of the specification. Since there has not yet been an\ninteroperability demonstration of an Advanced client working against\nmultiple Advanced servers, there is currently no evidence that can be used\nto effectively assess this risk.  As a result, it seems prudent to examine\nwhat would happen in a worst-case scenario where interoperability problems\nin Advanced features lead to a recycle at Proposed Standard.\n\nRe-issuing an RFC at Proposed can happen when there need to be such\nsubstantial modifications to a document that they transcend the \"minor\nchanges\" threshold for going to Draft Standard.  Alternately, it could be\nthat two interoperable implementations of each feature cannot be\ndemonstrated. If this were to happen to the DeltaV protocol, and the\nprotocol were specified in one document, it would require modifying the\nentire document, Core plus Advanced.  This would have the effect of adding\nsubstantial implementation risk even to vendors implementing just the Core\nfeatures.  This risk might lead to implementation being postponed, and a\nmuch slower adoption of the protocol. In contrast, if Core were kept in a\nseparate document, and Advanced features needed to be revised, it is likely\nthey would not impact the Core, and hence would not increase its\nimplementation risk.\n\n* A small Core document would be easier to \"sell\".  It would be much easier\nto convince implementors that a small Core versioning document is compact,\nand easy to implement, than Core in a large document.  Even though Core only\ntakes a small portion of the current document, an implementor still needs to\nread through the entire document, for sections like i18n, security, etc., to\nensure nothing has been missed.  For a small document, this work has already\nbeen performed, by the act of creating a smaller document.\n\n* The downside risk of separating the documents appears to be small.  The\nmajor downside risks of separating the documents appears to be that there\nwill be few client or server implementations of the Advanced features, and\nhence the Advanced features will be marginalized.  While there have not been\nany product announcements that I am aware of, it seems reasonable to assume\nthat the participation of top engineering talent from several significant CM\nvendors in this effort implies a willingness to implement all of the\nstandard, Core and Advanced.  Additionally, the Subversion open source\nproject is currently implementing a very full-featured CM client based on\nDeltaV.  So, I am not concerned about implementations of the Advanced\nfeatures -- I think this will happen.\n\nI am more concerned about authoring tools implementing the standard,\nprimarily due to concerns about the complexity of the protocol, based on\nCore being packaged with Advanced features.  A smaller Core document would\nallay some of these concerns, since authoring tools will primary just use\nthe Core features.\n\nBut, this said, I also recognize that development orgaizations interested in\nimplementing the protocol will perform a thorough engineering analysis\nanyway, and will quickly see through superficial issues such as document\nlength.  Furthermore, in the annals of engineering specifications, the\ncurrent DeltaV spec. is nowhere near the upper end of the scale for\ncomplexity, and length.  Far more complex interoperability specifications\nhave been implemented over time.\n\nAs a result, while I find myself somewhat in support of splitting the\ncurrent document, I am not 100% convinced.  I would appreciate hearing other\nviews on the matter.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13244173"}, {"subject": "RE: Labelling support optiona", "content": "FileNET is a vendor of web content management and document management\nproducts, but not software source code management products.

Hunt\" <jjh@ira.uka.de>\n\n   Valid XML should be used in WebDAV instead of simply well formed XML\n\nI believe that the benefits of XML validation is minimal at best.  It\nreally doesn't matter all that much if the errors are found by the XML\nparser or by the semantic routine that actually does the work\nfollowing parsing.  DTD's are just not a good way of defining the\nsyntax of XML elements that are intended to be extended by later\nversions of the protocol.\n\n   Another problem is to track version information about the protocols.\n   The DAV header as returned from an OPTIONS request (e.g.: \"DAV: 1, 2,\n   version-selector-checkout\") does not help at all.  However, when using\n   a DTD, the client and the server could agree on a protocol revision\n   (or otherwise stop communication with an appropriate error message or\n   log) by using the DTD's header information.\n\nSince any new XML element MUST (according to 2518) be ignorable,\na client should not stop communication when it encounters a different\nprotocol revision, but rather should just ignore elements that it\ndoes not understand ... that's what gets you interoperability.\n\n   Labels in DeltaV\n   ================\n\n   One of the recent changes in DeltaV was to remove labels from the core\n   versioning part and put them into the options part of the protocol.\n   We strongly suggest to undo this change.  Even if there exist two or\n   three revision control systems that do not use labels, labels are\n   essential for identifying sets of associated files in a repository of\n   versions.  And, actually, they are really easy to implement\n   (especially on top of a WebDAV implementation that requires built-in\n   mechanisms for property storage).\n\nI agree with Lisa that identifying sets of associated files in a\nrepository is not a required feature of versioning in a document\nmanagement system.\n\nIn addition, labels are not a \"good\" way of indentifying associated\nfiles in a repository because they require write access to the\nversion, when you should only need read access to generate a\nreference.  Furthermore, they are even worse in a distributed\nrepository, since they require you have access to all the versions of a\nversion history, which makes a distributed implementation of the\nversion history infeasible (one of the versioning goals was to\ndefine a protocol that was not incompatible with a distributed\nimplementation).\n\nA significantly better way to identify sets of associated files is with\nbaselines.  A baseline has references to versions, and therefore\nonly read access to the version is required to create a baseline,\nand unlike a label, a baseline does not require scanning all other\nversions of that version history and therefore supports a distributed\nimplementation.\n\nSince labels are a common implementation in non-distributed software\nversioning systems, it is reasonable to define a standard way to\nmanipulate them, but since they are not required by document\nmanagement versioning, and are incompatible with distributed\nversioning systems, I do not believe it is appropriate to make\nsupport for them be mandantory.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13270663"}, {"subject": "Re: Simplifying CHECKOUT behavior for core versioning client", "content": "On Fri, Dec 01, 2000 at 12:23:38AM -0500, Geoffrey M.

It\nreally implies \"making changes in private.\" This is an important\ndistinction.\n\nThat said: it is also reasonable to assume there are versioning systems that\ndo not provide a way to keep changes private until \"formal check-in.\" (a\nfileserver kind of operates this way)\n\n> If branching is not in core, then there is no need for a resource to\n> be checked out twice at the same time.

[typically; you might\nstill allow it, but only one person can check-in; the other will need to\nundo/cancel their checkout]\n\nThe second statement about version selectors doesn't seem to follow from the\nmultiple checkout thing.\n\n> Note that a\n> server that is \"working resource\" based can easily implement this\n> behavior by associating a working resource with the version selector\n> while it is \"checked out\", and direct all operations on the version\n> selector to this working resource.\n\nThis is dangerous behavior to tell clients to use. For a server that *wants*\nprivate changes to be possible, and wants the client to use the working\nresource, then clients using the above behavior will choke. If they do a\nCHECKOUT on a v-selector, then do a PUT to it (even if the server gave them\na w-resource), then the PUT will fail.\n\nIf the server returns a working resource, the client must use it.\n\n> We would then define two alternative forms of optional parallel\n> development, \"client side workspaces\" (with working resources) and\n> \"server side workspaces\" (with working resources).\n                           (with workspaces)  [per your followup]\n\nI like the distinction of server types.

This is true even in the case of simple linear histories, so the\n   following scenario would not be supported: update both contents and\n   properties on a privately checked out resource, followed by a CHECKIN\n   and a SET-TARGET which updates content and properties atomically for\n   other users.\n\nA client can effectively achieve the same effect by not doing the\nPUT/PROPPATCH until it has changes it wants to make visible\nand then locking the resource for the duration of the PUT/PROPPATCH.\nThe fact that there is a small window between the PUT and the PROPPATCH\nduring which another client could get the old properties and the new\ncontent is not really an issue, because a client always has to get\nthe content and properties separately (GET/PROPFIND) so there always\nis a window for such a skew (i.e. another client could do a PROPPATCH\nbetween the GET and PROPFIND).\n\n   > I believe we can address this issue by making branching an optional\n   > feature (i.e. move it from core to optional).

My point about making branching optional is bogus anyway,\nsince branching is provided by the ability to do a SET-TARGET, not\nby working resources or workspaces.  And the point is even more\nbogus because branching is in fact useful without merging (as Greg\nmentioned), so please forget I ever brought the point up (:-).\n\n   > I am periodically asked why core versioning requires support for\n   > parallel development when many useful versioning servers\n   > (primarily for document management) only support linear versioning.\n   > This is another motivation to make support for parallel development\n   > optional.\n   > \n   > If parallel development is not in core, then there is no need for\n   > a resource to be checked out twice at the same time.\n\n   I could agree on this, but what about the need for checking out a\n   resource privately (see above)?\n\nI believe that keeping authoring state on the client gives you most of\nwhat clients want for this ... the only thing you lose is the ability\nto create a version that *never* is visible to other clients under the\nversion selector URL.  This is a valid use case, but I believe it is\nnot nearly as important as the \"don't make my changes visible until\nI'm done\" use case (which you can do in the new model).\n\nNote that currently, a core client has to ask the server which form of\ncheckout the server supports, and then be prepared to either create\nworkspaces or keep track of working resources, depending on what the\nserver comes back with.  I predict that most clients will be designed\nto work with one model or the other, which means most clients will not\nbenefit from saying that \"a server must support one or the other\".\n\nBut a core client will benefit from us instead saying a server \"MUST\nsupport in place checkout for version creation\" and \"MAY support\nworking resources or workspaces for hidden/parallel development\".\n\n   > This means that neither\n   > workspaces nor working resources are required, and just the ability to\n   > check-out and check-in a version selector is sufficient.

This is no longer true in the model you propose.\n\nThis was never true for a core client, since the core protocol did not\nrequire support for creating working resources.  So the new model only\nadds things that a core client can count on, compared to the\nexisting model.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13318704"}, {"subject": "Re: Versioning TeleConf Agenda, 12/1/00 (Friday) 12-1pm ES", "content": "On Sat, Dec 02, 2000 at 08:22:58AM -0500, Geoffrey M.

The number can only be assigned once the full change set has been\ncomitted (they are sequential).\n\nConsider: Joe begins the CHECKIN on the resources and the server gave him\nversion number 7. Nancy begins her checkin and the server gives her 8.\nOops... Joe's checkin has failed. Now what?\n\nYou've got all kinds of race conditions and stuff going in there to try and\ndeal with the problem. Sure, the server knows all of the files that Joe is\ngoing to checkin (through examination of the activity), but it can't do\nanything about it until all the files are checked in. Does it say \"well,\nthere is a v7 for this file, but I can't give it to you right now.\" What if\nJoe never comes back? Nancy should have got v7 in that case.

The server simulates a checked-out\nversion selector by secretly associating a working resource with the\nversion selector when it is checked out.  The server redirects all\nrequest to that checked-out version selector to that working resource.\nWhen a client issues a PUT, the PUT gets redirected by the server to\nthe working resource, and the PUT succeeds.

When you do a CHECKOUT, the server will do one of two things:\n\n1) it is a workspace, so it checks out in place. the client continues to\n   work with that resource\n\n2) it returns 201 (Created) with a Location: header pointing to the working\n   resource.\n\nThe point is: the response may or may not provide a Location: header to tell\nthe client what to do.

The\npackaging of the protocol specification into one or more documents has been\nconsidered several times by the design team.\n\nThere are two primary options that have been discussed:\n\n1) Status-quo: describe the entire protocol, both core and advanced, in one\ndocument.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Possible increase in number of full server implementations (core +\nadvanced) of protocol\n* Reduced document overhead for boilerplate text, definitions,\nintroductions, etc.\n* Increased consistency, since all text is within a single document\n\nDisadvantages:\n* A single document is larger, and there is a perception that large protocol\nspecifications are complex.\n* A single document hides the inherent simplicity of the core versioning\nfeatures.  The simple core may be viewed as complex by its inclusion in a\nlong document.\n* Possible decrease in implementations of core features in authoring clients\n(due to perceived complexity)\n* Possible decrease in implementations of core versioning in document\nmanagement servers.\n\n2) Divide the specification into two documents, one for Core, one for\nAdvanced.\n\nAdvantages:\n* Possible increase in number of authoring client implementations, due to\nthe easily seen simplicity of the Core.\n* Possible increase in number of document management servers that implement\nCore versioning\n* It is likely Core versioning could be sent for IESG approval before the\nAdvanced document was entirely completed.\n* If interoperability problems are discovered in the Advanced features, they\ncould be fixed without impacting the specification of Core features. This\ncould lead to increased confidence in the Core features by implementors, and\nhence greater early adoption of Core features.\n\nDisadvantages:\n* Possible decrease in number of server implementations of Advanced\nfeatures.\n* Possible decrease in number of client implementations of Advanced\nfeatures.\n* Possible increase in inter-document inconsistency.\n* Repetition of defintions of terms, boilerplate text, etc.\n* Need for a document roadmap explaining subdivision of documents.\n\n\nI have long favored keeping the document together, as a whole (option #1).\nHowever, I am starting to lean towards subdividing the document (option #2).\nMy rationale is as follows:\n\n* Due to the relatively large number of optional Advanced features, there is\nsignificantly increased risk of interoperability problems in the Advanced\nportion of the specification. Since there has not yet been an\ninteroperability demonstration of an Advanced client working against\nmultiple Advanced servers, there is currently no evidence that can be used\nto effectively assess this risk.  As a result, it seems prudent to examine\nwhat would happen in a worst-case scenario where interoperability problems\nin Advanced features lead to a recycle at Proposed Standard.\n\nRe-issuing an RFC at Proposed can happen when there need to be such\nsubstantial modifications to a document that they transcend the \"minor\nchanges\" threshold for going to Draft Standard.  Alternately, it could be\nthat two interoperable implementations of each feature cannot be\ndemonstrated. If this were to happen to the DeltaV protocol, and the\nprotocol were specified in one document, it would require modifying the\nentire document, Core plus Advanced.  This would have the effect of adding\nsubstantial implementation risk even to vendors implementing just the Core\nfeatures.  This risk might lead to implementation being postponed, and a\nmuch slower adoption of the protocol. In contrast, if Core were kept in a\nseparate document, and Advanced features needed to be revised, it is likely\nthey would not impact the Core, and hence would not increase its\nimplementation risk.\n\n* A small Core document would be easier to \"sell\".  It would be much easier\nto convince implementors that a small Core versioning document is compact,\nand easy to implement, than Core in a large document.  Even though Core only\ntakes a small portion of the current document, an implementor still needs to\nread through the entire document, for sections like i18n, security, etc., to\nensure nothing has been missed.  For a small document, this work has already\nbeen performed, by the act of creating a smaller document.\n\n* The downside risk of separating the documents appears to be small.  The\nmajor downside risks of separating the documents appears to be that there\nwill be few client or server implementations of the Advanced features, and\nhence the Advanced features will be marginalized.  While there have not been\nany product announcements that I am aware of, it seems reasonable to assume\nthat the participation of top engineering talent from several significant CM\nvendors in this effort implies a willingness to implement all of the\nstandard, Core and Advanced.  Additionally, the Subversion open source\nproject is currently implementing a very full-featured CM client based on\nDeltaV.  So, I am not concerned about implementations of the Advanced\nfeatures -- I think this will happen.\n\nI am more concerned about authoring tools implementing the standard,\nprimarily due to concerns about the complexity of the protocol, based on\nCore being packaged with Advanced features.  A smaller Core document would\nallay some of these concerns, since authoring tools will primary just use\nthe Core features.\n\nBut, this said, I also recognize that development orgaizations interested in\nimplementing the protocol will perform a thorough engineering analysis\nanyway, and will quickly see through superficial issues such as document\nlength.  Furthermore, in the annals of engineering specifications, the\ncurrent DeltaV spec. is nowhere near the upper end of the scale for\ncomplexity, and length.  Far more complex interoperability specifications\nhave been implemented over time.\n\nAs a result, while I find myself somewhat in support of splitting the\ncurrent document, I am not 100% convinced.  I would appreciate hearing other\nviews on the matter.\n\n- Jim\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13404409"}, {"subject": "Re: Splitting the document", "content": "> > I am not very happy with the current structure of the document which\n> > divides all features into core WebDAV versioning and optional WebDAV\n> > versioning.

You either have a change set, or\n   you don't.

But there also are users that are\nhappy with public checkouts (and use locking for overwrite\nprotection).\n\nI believe it is very important that the protocol support clients\nwith no local persistent state, both because some clients in fact\nhave no local persistent state, and because it is often simpler\nto write such clients (thus increasing the adoption rate for the\nversioning protocol).\n\nSince making public checkouts mandantory allows you to write\nsimple clients with no local persistent state, I'd like to see\nthis in the protocol unless there are demonstrable implementation\nproblems.\n\nWith that background, some specific comments to Greg's message:\n\n   From: Greg Stein <gstein@lyra.org>\n\n   When you do a CHECKOUT, the server will do one of two things:\n\n   1) it is a workspace, so it checks out in place. the client continues to\n      work with that resource\n\n   2) it returns 201 (Created) with a Location: header pointing to the working\n      resource.\n\nIn the current protocol, whether or not a version-controlled resource\nis in a workspace has no affect on this aspect of the CHECKOUT\nbehavior.  If the CHECKOUT is applied to a version-controlled resource\nand it does not have a DAV:apply-to-target argument, it MUST do #1 (it\ncannot do #2).  if a CHECKOUT is applied to a version or has a\nDAV:apply-to-target argument, it MUST do #2 (it cannot do #1).\n\n   The point is: the response may or may not provide a Location: header to tell\n   the client what to do. The client should always respect that.\n\nThe current protocol is designed so that the client controls\nwhether or not it needs to use/remember the Location header value.\nIf it always had to use the Location header value, a client\nwithout local persistent state would be in trouble if a session\nended without the working resources being checked in.\n\n   You said the client would choke if it expected the working resource model\n   against a workspace server. Not at all... it would not see a Location: come\n   back, so it wouldn't alter the URL to use for modifying the resource.\n\nIf it expected the working resource model, in the current protocol it\nwould have to either use the DAV:apply-to-target parameter or checkout\na version, and a workspace-based server that does not support working\nresources would choke (since it is not able to issue free-standing\nworking resources, but can only checkout \"in-place\").\n\n   Simple examination of the Location: header. I would expect most clients to\n   be able to work with both.\n\nA client that has no local persistent storage would not work well with\na server that expected it to remember working resource URL's.\n\n   >    If they do a CHECKOUT on a v-selector, then do a PUT to it (even if\n   >    the server gave them a w-resource), then the PUT will fail.\n   > \n   > I don't follow you here.

See... that isn't in the specification. You're asking for more behavior\n   on version selectors than exists today.\n\nI was just describing an implementation technique, to show that it is\neasy for a working resource based implementation to simulate an\nin-place checkout protocol.\n\n   I disagree with this addition. Again: you're trying to swing everything\n   towards something like a checked-out version selector model.\n   The client should simply use the Location: header.\n\nI'm just trying to make sure that you can write clients that don't\nhave a local persistent store, and that don't require a user to\ncheckin everything at the end of an editing session.\n\n   > The server redirects all\n   > request to that checked-out version selector to that working resource.\n   > When a client issues a PUT, the PUT gets redirected by the server to\n   > the working resource, and the PUT succeeds.

That is quite different from today's spec,\n\nThis wasn't anything about the spec ...  I was just describing a\nsimple implementation of in-place checkout behavior by a server that\nhas a working-resource based implementation.\n\n   and I don't see a basis for this except to allow clients to ignore\n   the Location header and continue working with the same request-URI.\n\nI believe that is what is required to support clients without local\npersistent state.\n\n   > Did the above clarify how I believe a working resource based\n   > implementation would provide v-selector checkout?\n\n   Clear, yes, and I don't think that it works well.\n\nI understand that your cient wouldn't use it, but why doesn't it work\nwell?  It allows a client to be written without local persistent state,\nand is easy for a server to implement.\n\n   Clients that ignore the Location header will break when you have an advanced\n   server which provides for parallel development. That server cannot allow\n   clients to continue working from the v-selector. The clients *must* work\n   from the working resource.\n\nThere are two ways of providing parallel development: server side\nworkspaces and client side workspaces (with working resources).\nSome servers will only support server-side workspaces for parallel\ndevelopment, and others will only support client side workspaces\nfor parallel development.  Clients that use only client side\nworkspaces will only work against servers that support client side\nworkspaces, and clients that use only server side workspaces\nwill only work against servers that support server side workspaces.\n\nMaking in-place checkout mandantory has no effect (either positive\nor negative) on this.\n\n   But the cool point is: you can still have the same dumb client talking to\n   this advanced server, as the client talking to the dumb no-parallel server.\n   The model the client sees is the same.\n\nI believe most users will care whether or not their checkouts are\npublic or private, and I believe most clients will care whether or not\nthey have to remember working resource URLs between sessions, so I\ndon't think a form of CHECKOUT that takes these choices out of the\nhands of the client is of much utility.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13502341"}, {"subject": "Newcome", "content": "I have just started to get envolved with WebDAV and I would really\nappreciate it if someone could point to me some useful (and easy to\nunderstand) links or information for versioning(What can be versioned how \ne.t.c)\n\nThanx\nStamaths\n\nPS:Sorry if the mail seems kind of stupid but I have never before \nworked neither with http nor with any kind of versioning(CVS).\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13517107"}, {"subject": "Re: Review of draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-10.4/", "content": "       From: Juergen Reuter [mailto:reuterj@ira.uka.de]\n\n   I am not very happy with the current structure of the document\n   which divides all features into core WebDAV versioning and optional\n   WebDAV versioning.  Currently, the core part is getting smaller and\n   smaller, while the optional part continuously grows.  The problem I\n   see is that server implementors will either implement the core part\n   only, or, in practice, they will have to implement also the full\n   optional part.\n\nNote that the options are divided 6 packages, which are identified in\nthe DAV header response from an OPTIONS request.  These are \"label\",\n\"workspace\", \"baseline\", \"activity\", \"merge\", and\n\"versioned-collection\".  Clients are expected to look for these option\npackages via the OPTIONS request.\n\nWe could restructure the document into one section per option package.\nWhat do others think? \n\n   I think the original idea of core/optional versioning was to\n   separate core versioning semantics from advanced semantics (mostly\n   configuration management).  So, maybe you could reintroduce this\n   idea into the protocol by defining three levels:\n\n   - core versioning: minimally required features\n\n   - versioning: fully fledged versiong including labels and branches\n   (and maybe merging)\n\n   - advanced versioning: configuration management and all remaining\n   optional features\n\nWhat is in the \"versioning\" level varies widely from server to server.\nI believe the current division into orthogonal option sets is what is\nrequired to achieve consensus.\n\n   Section 1.3\n   - ---------\n\n   Version Selector/Working Resource:\n\n   The definition of the term \"Working Resource\" as opposed to that of\n   \"Version Selector\" seems confusing to me.  The pure fact that the\n   CHECKOUT method is defined to be applicable on both types of\n   resources, does not make them suitable for a direct comparison.\n\nNote that the things that can be checked out are version-controlled\nresources and versions.  The result of the checkout is either a\nchecked-out version-controlled resource, or a working resource,\nrespectively.\n\n   I think it would be better to characterize the term \"working\n   resource\" independently from \"checking out a version selector\".\n\nI agree.  I'll see what I can work up (this is connected to some\npoints you make below).\n\n   Maybe when defining the term \"version selector\" you might want to\n   add a note about checking out version selectors.  To summarize, I\n   would like to suggest the following wording:\n\n   Version Selector:\n   When an existing resource is put under version control, it becomes a\n   \"version selector\" resource.  A new version history resource is\n   allocated, whose initial version contains the content and dead\n   properties of the existing resource.\n   A checkout may be applied to version selector.  This will make a copy\n   of an existing version of the version history accessible for editing.\n\nThis might be a bit misleading since a checkout applied to a version\nselector does not make a copy of anything ...  it just changes the\nstate of the version selector from checked-in to checked-out.\nChecking out a version does make a copy (the working resource).\n\n   A subsequent checkin will create a new version in the version history.\n   Checking out a version selector is useful for environments where only\n   a single user accesses the version selector.\n\nNote though that multiple users can access a shared checked out\nversion selector by using the locking protocol.  Also, you need to be\ncareful to not mislead the reader into thinking that checking out a\nversion selector is useful only when a single user is doing\ndevelopment (when workspaces are supported, multiple users each check\nout their own version selector for a shared version history).\n\n   Working resource:\n   If multiple users concurrently try to check out the same version\n   selector, they will interfere each other.  To avoid this, a checkout\n   can also be directly applied to a version.  This will create a new\n   resource, called \"working resource\".  The working resource can be\n   modified and is automatically deleted when it is checked in.  The\n   server allocates a distinct new URL for each new working resource.\n\nNote that in general, we try not to go into this much detail in the\n\"terminology\" section, but rather do so in the \"semantics\" or\n\"concepts\" section.\n\n   Section 2: WebDAV Versioning Semantics\n   - ------------------------------------\n   This section discusses rather concepts than semantics, right?\n\nI'm happy with either word ... just for interest's sake, why don't you\nthink \"semantics\" are being described in this section?\n\n   Section 3: New WebDAV XML Element Attributes\n   - ------------------------------------------\n   As both, the headline itself and the introductory statement to this\n   section suggest, this section should be moved to (a new revision of)\n   the WebDAV protocol.\n\nI agree, but unless we defer the versioning protocol until such a new\nrevision is created, we are stuck with defining WebDAV extensions in\nthe versioning protocol when we find they are needed.  So as soon as\nthe WebDAV extension is defined, I'm happy to strip this kind of thing\nfrom the versioning protocol.\n\nI've recently received a suggestion from Yaron that we replace this with\ntokens for the If header.  I think he's right, so it's likely that we'll\nbe killing this section anyway.\n\n   Section 4: New WebDAV Properties\n   - ------------------------------\n   Again, move this to WebDAV.  Note that 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 do *not*\n   introduce new WebDAV properties, as the headline claims.\n\nYes, 4.1.3 and 4.1.4 just got put there because there seemed to be no\nplace better to put them.\n\n   Section 4.4: DAV:supported-method-set\n   - -----------------------------------\n   > method-name type: a type in the DAV://METHODS/ namespace\n\n   In general, this does not work. ...\n   Personally, I would prefer a syntax like:\n\n     <D:supported-method-set xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n       <D:method-name>GET</D:method-name>\n       </D:supported-method-set>\n\nThis would be fine with me.  I'll make that change if nobody objects.\n\n   Section 4.6: DAV:supported-report-set\n   - -----------------------------------\n   Same problem as in section 4.5.  However, this is currently\n   independent from WebDAV and hence can and should be fixed, e.g.:\n\n   <D:supported-report-set xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:report-name>version-tree-report</D:report-name>\n     <D:report-name>property-report</D:report-name>\n   </D:supported-report-set>\n\nOne reason DeltaV (and WebDAV) use this approach is that it\nallows for consistent use of namespaces, i.e. so you can have\nyour XML parser to namespace resolution of these report names.\nIf one made the change you suggest, it would have to be\nsomething like:\n\n   <D:supported-report-set xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:report-name>DAV:version-tree-report</D:report-name>\n     <D:report-name>DAV:property-report</D:report-name>\n   </D:supported-report-set>\n\n   Section 5.1.2: DAV:predecessor-set (protected),\n   Section 5.1.3: DAV:successor-set (protected)\n   - ---------------------------------------------\n   It is very important that the server really maintains the order of the\n   DAV:href elements, as noted for the predecessor set.  But the\n   successor set should also be maintained.  Think for example of\n   graphically displaying a revision graph.  You really do not want the\n   branches of the revision graph to be aligned differently each time the\n   graph is re-displayed.  Moreover, an application might want to\n   designate the first DAV:href element of the successor set to continue\n   the main development branch.\n\nUnlike the DAV:predecessor-set (which is set by the client),\nthe DAV:successor-set is a query (the inverse of DAV:predecessor-set)\ncomputed by the server, and constraining\nthe order of the results of this computation would place an (in my view)\nunacceptable constraint on server implementations.\n\nIf a server wants to interoperate with multiple clients, it should\nuse an activity to capture the \"main branch\", and not depend upon\nsome server dependent predecessor set ordering.\n\n   Section 5.1.4: DAV:checkout-set (protected)\n   - -------------------------------------------\n   This should also be an ordered set maintained by the server.  For\n   example, think of a client that chooses to graphically display working\n   resources and checked-out version selectors as part of a revision\n   graph.  Or, to give another example, depending on the underlying\n   revision control system, the first element in the set may be a\n   designated candidate to continue the main development branch.\n\nSame response as for DAV:successor-set.  This is not a client specified\nproperty, it is a server computation/query.\n\n   Section 6: WebDAV Versioning and Existing Headers\n   - -----------------------------------------------\n   I think this headline does not express what is following.  Personally,\n   I would prefer a wording like:\n\n   \"Versioning Vis-a-Vis WevDAV Headers\" or\n   \"Impact of Versioning on WebDAV Headers\".\n\nThe new versioning header is still a WebDAV header, so I personally\nprefer the current title.  Anyone else have a preference?\n\n   Section 7.1.1: Example - GET request with DAV:must-not-be-checked-out\n   response\n   -\n   ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   ----\n   The example contains a CHECKOUT request, not a GET request.\n\nOops!  Thanks for catching that.\n\n   > In this example, the request to CHECKOUT /foo.html fails because\n   > /foo.html is already checked out\n\n   ... and /foo.html is a version selector, or because the server chooses\n   not to branch off a new version.\n\nIf it were those other things, it would have returned a different\ntoken in the response body.\n\n   Section 7.2: OPTIONS\n   - ------------------\n   > If the server supports checking out a version selector\n\n   i.e. checking out a version selector is an optional feature and should\n   be moved to Optional WebDAV Versioning?\n\nWe're currently addressing this in a separate thread.  My proposal\nis that support for checking out a version-controlled resource be\nmandantory (since it is easy for both client-workspace and server-workspace\nservers to implement).\n\n   Section 7.3: PUT\n   - --------------\n   In the preconditions section, you use the format\n   \"<DAV:some-error-tag/>: Error condition\".  To be kind,\n   you should introduce the reader to this format or use a more\n   self-explanatory format.\n\nOK, what would the more self-explanatory format be?  (:-).\n\nBut more seriously, I agree this needs explanation.  I'll add it to\nthe \"notational conventions\" section.\n\n   Section 7.4: PROPPATCH\n   - --------------------\n   > <DAV:cannot-modify-protected-property/>: An attempt to use PROPPATCH\n   > to modify a property (either core or optional) defined by this\n   > document as being protected MUST fail.\n\n   > <DAV:cannot-modify-unsupported-property/>: An attempt to modify a\n   > property defined by this document (either core or optional) whose\n   > semantics are not enforced by the server MUST fail.  This helps ensure\n   > that a client will be notified when it is trying to use a property\n   > whose semantics are not supported by the server.\n\n   What about moving these features to WebDAV?  They are probably of\n   generic interest and not versioning specific (assuming that the\n   definition of the term \"protected property\" also could be moved to\n   WebDAV).\n\nWhen there is a new version of the WebDAV protocol open for editing, I\nagree we should move it there.\n\n   Section 9.1: VERSION_CONTROL\n   - --------------------------\n   The logical structure of the rules in this section seems rather weird\n   to me.\n\n   The section contains the following precondition:\n\n   > <DAV:must-be-versionable/>: The request-URL MUST identify a\n   > versionable resource, a null resource, or a version selector.\n\n   Accordingly, I would expect three paragraphs in the beginning of this\n   section:\n\n   \"If the request-URL identifies a versionable resource, then ...\"\n   \"If the request-URL identifies a null resource, then ...\"\n   \"If the request-URL identifies a version selector, then ...\"\n\n   A classification into disjunctive sets of cases also is probably\n   less error prone.\n\nSome of these conditions apply to more than one of these cases,\nso with a disjunctive set of cases, we would have to repeat preconditions\nappearing in other cases, which seems error prone.\n\nOn the other hand, there are two preconditions that only apply to\nversion controlling a null resource, and those should be grouped\ntogether (and currently are not).  I'll fix that.\n\n   Actually, in section 9.1 currently there is only a paragraph about\n   versionable resources.  The second paragraph talks about the case when\n   the request *body* identifies a version.\n\n   The postconditions section, on the other hand, classifies cases\n   thoroughly.  Still, I wonder which rules apply when the request-URL\n   identifies a version selector.  Section 9.1 only says that\n\n   > the DAV:version-control request\n   > body element MUST NOT contain a DAV:version element.\"\n   (precondition)\n\n   and:\n\n   > If the request-URL identified a version selector at the time of the\n   > request, the VERSION-CONTROL request MUST NOT change the state of that\n   > version selector.\n   (postcondition)\n\n   But then, what does a VERSION-CONTROL do at all if the request-URL is\n   a version selector?\n\nNothing.  This is here to let a client use the same protocol sequence\nto put a resource under version control, whether or not the server\nautomatically puts all new resources under version control (which a\nserver is allowed to do).  I'll add a sentence to this effect, since\nI've had that question before.\n\n   Section 9.2: CHECKOUT\n   - -------------------\n   > A versioning server MUST support either version selector CHECKOUT or\n   > version CHECKOUT, and MAY support both.\n\n   These two concepts should be explained somewhere (e.g. in the terms\n   section or in the introductory section).  As far as I understand,\n   version selector CHECKOUT is appropriate only when a single user\n   accesses a versioned resource?  And as soon as two or more users want\n   to access it, you need working resources and hence have to apply\n   version CHECKOUT?  If so, this should be somewhere explained (e.g. as\n   rationale or concepts, for example in the introduction).\n\nI agree that these variants need to be better explained and contrasted.\n\nI believe that we should break this up into three categories:\npublic checkouts (in place checkouts, must be supported)\nclient workspaces (working resources, optional)\nserver workspaces (server side workspaces, optional).\n\n   Possible you might choose leaving version selector CHECKOUT as\n   core versioning feature, but moving version CHECKOUT to optional\n   versioning (preferably as part of the fully fledged versioning as\n   proposed in the beginning of this mail).\n\nI agree.  This would give us required functionality (public checkouts)\nand the two options for private checkouts: client workspaces (working\nresources) and server workspaces\n\n   > The content and dead properties of the working resource MUST be the\n   > same as the content and dead properties of the DAV:checked-out\n   > version.\n\n   I would prefer the following wording:\n\n   \"The content and dead properties of the working resource MUST be\n   initialized with the content and dead properties of the\n   DAV:checked-out version.\"\n\nOne could phrase postconditions in the form of \"this is the state\nfollowing the successful execution of the request\" or \"this is what\nthe server must do to successfully execute this request.  Either one\nworks, but we should be consistent, and currently the postconditions\nare in the first form.  I also believe the first form is simpler.\n\n   > If DAV:apply-to-target is specified in the request body, the CHECKOUT\n   > is applied to the version identified by the DAV:target of the version\n   > selector, and not the version selector itself.\n\n   For better understanding, I would suggest the following wording:\n\n   > If the request-URL contains a version selector and DAV:apply-to-target\n   > is specified in the request body, the CHECKOUT is applied to the\n   > version identified by the DAV:target of the version selector, and not\n   > the version selector itself.\n\nFine by me.  I'll add that in.\n\n   Section 9.3: CHECKIN\n   - ------------------\n   The meaning of DAV:keep-checked-out is not just to keep a checked out\n   resource when applying a CHECKIN, but also to perform a subsequent\n   update of the checked out resource's DAV:checked-out property.  As far\n   as I understand, this results in a behaviour that is the same as that\n   of a CHECKIN immediately followed by a CHECKOUT (except that in the\n   case of a working resource its URL is recycled).  Hence, I would\n   suggest to name this XML element e.g. \"DAV:checkpoint\" rather than\n   \"DAV:keep-checked-out\".\n\nThe term \"checkpoint\" is used by several CM systems to mean something\nlike a \"baseline\", so I think DAV:keep-checked-out is less likely to\nconfuse people.\n\n   Section 9.4: UNCHECKOUT\n   - ---------------------\n   > An UNCHECKOUT request can be applied to a checked-out version selector\n   > to cancel the CHECKOUT.\n\n   This probably should read:\n\n   \"An UNCHECKOUT request can be applied to a checked-out version selector\n   or working resource to cancel the CHECKOUT.\"\n\n   Or should I use DELETE to cancel a version CHECKOUT (though I\n   personally would prefer UNCHECKOUT)?  If so, an appropriate note for\n   the reader should be added.\n\nI'll add that note.  UNCHECKOUT is there primarily to reset the\ncontent and dead properties of a checked-out version-controlled\nresource.  For a working resource, a simple DELETE will suffice (there\nis no modified version-controlled state to reset in that case).\n\n   Section 9.5: SET_TARGET\n   - ---------------------\n   Typo: \"Preconditions:\" has a boldface colon.  This occurs also in some\n   other sections (e.g. 15.12, 16.1).\n\nThanks for noticing that!  I'll get rid of those.\n\n   Section 10.1: DAV:version-tree-report\n   - -----------------------------------\n\n   > The DAV:version-tree-report describes all the versions of the version\n   > history of a version in the form of a nested tree of versions.\n\n   I would prefer the following wording:\n\n   The DAV:version-tree-report describes all the descendant versions for a\n   given version in a version history in the form of a nested tree\n   of versions.\n\nThat would be a functional change, rather than a wording change.\nCurrently DAV:version-tree-report gives you the full report for\nall versions in the history (i.e. a report rooted at the initial\nversion rather than one at the specified version).\n\nDo folks think we want to make that change?  We could make\nthis report on version selector be the whole tree, while this\nreport on a version be rooted at that version.\n\n   > ANY value: zero or more property-name elements\n   >\n   > property-name type: a property type\n   >\n   > property-name value: none\n\n   This should be explained more verbosely.\n\n   > <!ELEMENT prop (see [RFC2518], section 12.11)>\n\n   Argh!  This is definitely not a valid element definition.\n\nSince the spec is being read by humans and not XML parsers,\nwe should be OK (:-).  But I'm happy to replace the !ELEMENT\nwith English text.\n\n   Section 10.1.1: Example - DAV:version-tree-report\n   - -----------------------------------------------\n\n   >     <D:creator-displayname/>\n   >\n   >     <D:predecessor-set>\n   >\n   >   </D:version-tree-report xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n\n   Typo: should be <D:predecessor-set/>\n\nThanks for catching that!\n\n   Section: 16.1 LABEL\n   - -----------------\n   > When comparing two label names to decide if they match or not, a\n   > server SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the\n   > two label names.\n\n   I propose to replace \"SHOULD\" with \"MUST\".  Otherwise, a client can\n   not be sure, what the server actually does and has to assume the worst\n   case, i.e. case-insensitive match.\n\nYeah, I'd prefer that too, but this was the compromise after a long\nand 'vigorous' (:-) debate.  One hates to say \"SHOULD\" except as a\nlast resort, and this was one of those cases.\n\n   > <!ELEMENT add (label-name)>\n   >\n   > <!ELEMENT set (label-name)>\n\n   I still think that the difference between these two elements and their\n   semantics does not get clear.\n\nHmm.  Can you identify what mistake a reader could make based\non the current definitions?\n\n   > <DAV:must-be-version-or-version-selector/>: The request-URL MUST\n   > identify a version or a version selector.\n\n   This probably should read:\n\n   \"<DAV:must-be-version-or-version-selector-or-collection/>: The\n   request-URL MUST identify a version or a version selector or a\n   collection.\"\n\nIn general, we consider a Depth:n request to be just a macro for\na set of Depth:0 (or non-Depth) requests, whose responses appear\nseparately in a 207.  If one of the collections is not a version\nselector, it MUST return this error token in the 207 response\nfor this particular collection.\n\n   > <DAV:must-not-be-checked-out/>: If LABEL is being applied to a version\n   > selector, it MUST NOT be checked out.\n\n   The phrase \"it MUST NOT be checked out\" is ambigous\n   (noun/verb/adjective phrase or passive voice).  For clearity, what\n   about the following:\n\n   \"<DAV:must-not-be-checked-out/>: Applying LABEL to a version selector\n   MUST fail, if the DAV:checked-out property appears on that version\n   selector.\"\n\nI have tried to consistently use \"checked-out\" as an adjective and\n\"checked out\" as a verb.  In this case, I erred (I should have said\n\"checked-out\").  I'll fix that.\n\nThanks for the great detailed review!!\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13523951"}, {"subject": "Re: Working collection", "content": "On Tue, Dec 05, 2000 at 10:05:15AM -0500, Geoffrey M.

The nice thing about separating the doc\n   into discrete \"packages\" is that it's easier to make sure each package is a\n   consistent set of features by itself, or to know what other package is\n   relied upon.\n\n   Lisa\n\n   > -----Original Message-----\n   > From: ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org\n   > [mailto:ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org]On Behalf Of Jim Whitehead\n   > Sent: Tuesday, December 05, 2000 3:41 PM\n   > To: Geoffrey M.

Where would this cause a problem?\n\nLet's say that Joe has foo.c checked out and it has a working resource as\npart of the activity -- due for checkin. That checkin will be v7. The server\nassigns v7 to Joe and waits for the individual checkins to arrive.\n\nJane comes along and wants to check in an update to foo.c also. She had v6\nand the server goes \"you can't check in your changes. you can only check in\nrelative to the latest (v7).\" But Jane can't get the latest.\n\n>    What if\n>    Joe never comes back?

So they are /not/ independent. And since they aren't independent,\nHTTP's stateless nature creates problems if you attempt to check them in\npiecemeal.\n\n>    > Why not allow intermediate states of that\n>    > change set to be manifested on the server?\n> \n>    Because the whole shebang is transacted.

Especially now that you're trying to\nattach a \"mandatory\" condition onto it.\n\nWhat *should* be mandatory is that the client obeys the Location: header if\nthe server returns one on a CHECKOUT.\n\nThis automatically provides for both \"public checkouts\" and \"client\nworkspaces\" (to use your terms). If the server does not return a Location,\nthen you have a \"public checkout.\" If the server returns a Location pointing\nat a working resource, then you have a \"client workspace.\"\n\nThis also satisfies your assumption that it is \"easy.\" I'll tell you right\nnow that a public checkout is NOT easy for me (i.e. you're assuming too\nmuch). Returning a Location header is cake.\n\nWhy do you suggest that a client should ignore a returned Location header?\n\nServer workspaces are set up by the client manually, and that support is\ndetectable through OPTIONS.\n\nCheers,\n-g\n\n-- \nGreg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13769311"}, {"subject": "Re: Simplifying CHECKOUT behavior for core versioning client", "content": "On Tue, Dec 05, 2000 at 11:26:46AM -0500, Geoffrey M.

The repository transacts the changes, and assigns a number\nat commit time for the transaction.\n\nIt is impossible to have a partial commit, and assign a number. It must all\nbe there, or none of it will be there. If Joe is working on his commit, and\nNancy zooms in with a quick commit, then she'll get v7, and Joe's commit\nwill be v8.\n\nThis transacted commit behavior is to avoid the race conditions and\nnon-determinism mentioned above. Individual working resources cannot be\nchecked in (via CHECKIN) because the whole set must go in as a group.\nTherefore, the activity CHECKIN as the signal for the group.\n\nCheers,\n-g\n\n-- \nGreg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13939475"}, {"subject": "Re: Working collection", "content": "Subversion (SVN) doesn't use workspaces, so the .o files are only on the\nlocal machine.

(Lisa)\"\nDebated why labels should not be in core -- primarily because it is not\nrequired by\ndocument management systems, and it is not viable in distributed\ndisconnected\nimplementations.  Agreed that it should not be in core.\n\n\"Removed Workspace header (Geoff)\"\nDiscussed why the workspace header is problematic.  The problem is\nillustrated by the\nuse of absolute URLs embedded in documents (i.e., links).  When resources\nare in\nworkspaces it is usual that the absolute URL should be interpreted relative\nto the\nworkspace.  The workspace header was proposed to provide a prefix for all\nURLs in the\nrequest.\nHowever, not all URLs should be interpreted relative to the workspace.  For\nexample,\nversion URLs would not be interpreted relative to the workspace.  The\nserver has no way\nof knowing when a URL is workspace relative, and when it is root relative.\nIt was proposed that the server should be able to recognise a URL as a\nserver generated\nURL and thereby not interpret it workspace relative (not apply the\nworkspace header),\nhowever, it was agreed that we cannot dictate that the server allocate a\nfixed part of the\nnamespace for version URLs.\nIt was recognised that this means that server side includes will not work.\n\n\"Added DAV:must-not-be-checked-out precondition for LABEL (John)\"\nAgreed.\n\n\"Only require Multi-Status if there was an error in a Depth operation (e.g.\nLABEL and\nSET-TARGET).

Agreed that we should adopt 'optional' but think of\nways to entice\npeople to implement it.\n\n\"Changed the DAV:repository-report into DAV:workspace-collection-set and\nDAV:activity-collection-set properties. (Ross)\"\nIn as much as this represents splitting the repository report into separate\nqueries for\nworkspace collections and activity collections, this was agreed, but this\nis likely\nsubsumed by a later suggestion for making this information available\nthrough OPTIONS.\n\n\"Marked the DAV:supported-xxx properties as \"protected\". (JimW)\"\nThis is also in OPTIONS and subsumed by a later recommendation.\n\n\"Cleaned up bad ANY syntax for the DTD's. (Geoff)\"\nAgreed.\n\n\"Use strings in DAV:method elements to define DAV:supported-methods.\n(Juergen)\"\nAgreed.\n\n\"Removed DAV:if-unsupported (use If header when needed) (Yaron).\"\nThe protocol doesn't rely on this behaviour, however, it is considered to\nbe useful (if\npeople ever need it).\n\n\"Moved the DAV:workspace property from version-controlled resources to any\nresource,\nsince resources other than version-controlled resources can be in a\nworkspace (Tim).\"\nAgreed.\n\n\"Changed the return status of VERSION-CONTROL on an existing resource to be\n200\n(Greg).\"\nAgreed\n\n\"Added the impact of DELETE on properties that refer to the deleted\nresource (Greg).\"\nAgreed that any references to the deleted resource should be removed from\nDAV\nproperties.\n\nIt was pointed out that for all computed properties (e.g., 'successor set'\ndefined as the\n\nlist\nof resources who have this resource as a predecessor) the protocol document\nshould\nmention that any method that affects the resources it is computed from\naffects the value\nof the property.\n\n\"Changed the DTD of all top level request and response nodes to be ANY\n(Yaron).\"\nDefer to a later XML discussion.\n\n\"Have version CHECKOUT example use version URL (Chuck).\"\nAgreed\n\n\"Renamed version selector to be version-controlled resource (Geoff).\"\nAgreed.\n\n\"Renamed Target-Selector header to be Label header (Geoff).\"\nAgreed, and that there would be other headers created if required (i.e.\nbaseline:, activity:\n...).\n\n\"Divided optional section into one section per option (Juergen).\"\nThe group liked the idea of splitting the document, however, should the\noptional\nbehaviour document duplicate the information contained in core (so that it\nis a stand-\nalone document) or should it reference the core document?  Agreed to ask\nthe mailing list\nsince there was no consensus reached.\n\nAgreed that we need to add some model description, esp. illustrating the\nuse of client-\nbased vs. server-based workspaces.  Will add a section at the end of the\ndocument that\nbrings the concepts together, with a forward reference to this section\nsince some people\nmay prefer to read this section before the terms etc. are introduced.\n\nVarious changes to the document were discussed:\n\n2.1.4 Auto-versioning\nIt was noted that non-versioning clients may receive errors related to\nversioning\noperations, however, since we are not introducing new status codes, the\nclients will\nunderstand the status code as an error, but they won't understand the\nextended status\nXML body.\n\n2.2 Common property values\nSome of these are duplications of RFC2518 and some are new/modified\ndefinitions.\nAgreed that this duplication was ok.\n\nDiscussed that fact that version controlled resources (VCRs) have different\nproperties\ndepending upon whether they are checked in / checked out.  Suggested having\na DAV:is-\nchecked-in (Boolean) property and reusing the DAV:target property.  Some\npeople felt\nstrongly that individual properties (e.g., DAV:target) should not have\ndifferent meanings\ndepending upon resource state.  Agreed to leave it alone.\n\nDiscussion of DAV:predecessor-set : why it cannot be used to denote the\nchecked out\nversion (e.g., by putting the checked out version URL as the first in the\nlist).  Clients\n\ncan\nmodify the DAV:predecessor-set because it represents the logical successor\nnot the\nchecked out resource.  Clients may remove the checked out version URL from\nthe\npredecessor set and add other URLs (from the same version history).\nAn example of where this is useful is a server that only supports linear\nhistory, and\nclients have branched by checking out the same version.  The second client\nto checkin\ncan do a merge (with the first to checkin) and fix-up the predecessor set\nto maintain linear\nhistory.\n\n2.4.3 predecessor set should have a DTD fragment to be consistent with\nother definitions.\n\nDAV:version-name property is generally useful for clients, but is not used\nin the\nprotocol.  It is envisaged that it would be used in a PROPFIND type request\nrather than\nused to 'directly' access the resource (such as with a VersionName:\nheader).\n\nThe overwrite header description may need rewriting to improve its clarity\n-- Jim A.\nagreed to draft a rewrite.\n\nThe body of section 2.8 OPTIONS should explain what the request body is\nused for.\nCorrect \"If a request body is included, it MUST be a DAV:options-response\nXML\nelement.\" to read \"if a response body ...\".\n\n2.8 supported live properties.  Would like to modify the XML to allow\npassing metadata\nabout the property (e.g., type, whether protected, etc.) by adding another\nlevel of element\n<DAV:property-name> around the existing name data.  Agreed.\n\n2.10 PROPPATCH semantics\nIt was recognised that a versioning aware client may set versioning\nproperties on a non-\nversioning server, and the server would accept the properties (as dead\nproperties).  It\nbehoves clients to check the capabilities of a server (using OPTIONS).\n\nDELETE vs. UNCHECKOUT\nFor a version controlled resource(VCR) DELETE means 'go away' whereas\nUNCHECKOUT means 'revert to checked-in (version) state'; for a working\nresource\nDELETE means 'go away' and there is no equivalent for revert to checked in\nstate.\n\n2.12 COPY semantics needs similar semantics description to PUT & PROPPATCH\nwhere the destination is a VCR.  (No such change to be made to 2.13).\n\n2.14 REPORT method -- why not just use POST?  REPORT is defined to have\nread-only\nsemantics and so is more likely to be acceptable to proxies/servers who\nhave security\nconcerns.  In addition it does not require extending/redefining the\nsemantics of POST.\n\n2.16 postconditions of CHECKOUT does not describe the effect on the checked\nout set\n(this is another example of a 'inverse property' that is defined as a\nfunction of other\nproperties) the effect should be called out explicitly.\nEditorial change: now that the document is split there is no need to say\n\"If a version-\ncontrolled resource was checked out ...\".\n\n2.18 UNCHECKOUT also requires the effect on the checkout-set.\n\n2.20 version tree report also should remove \"If the report is applied to a\nchecked-in\nversion-controlled resource ...\"\n\nXML DTD -- we will create a valid DTD for delta-v, and we will strive to\nget rid of the\nANYs (retaining them in places where extensibility is explicitly\npredicted).  We need to\nallow servers to add proprietary extensions to the XML.  Recognised that a\nDTD is a\npoor-man's solution, and that an XML schema would be more meaningful and\nextendable and would allow clients and servers to validate messages.  Could\nbe added to\nan appendix, but we won't hold up the progress of the document waiting for\nthis.\n\nOrdering of successor list / version tree report\nAgreed that there is no need for the server to assure any ordering or\nrepeatability of\nordering across subsequent request/responses; it is left to the client to\napplying any\ntemporal ordering if this is required.\n\nBrief discussion of activities.  They are used for branching and change\nsets by clients,\nand are indistinguishable as resource on the server.  Activities can be\nused to model\neither--interoperably.\n\nMeeting closed at 3:00pm.\n\nRegards,\n\nTim Ellison\nJava Technology Centre, MP146\nIBM UK Laboratory, Hursley Park, Winchester, UK.\ntel: +44 (0)1962 819872  internal: 249872  MOBx: 270452\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-13965857"}, {"subject": "stuck at sherato", "content": "IETFers,\n\nI'm stuck at the Sheraton, and don't have my own transportation to the\nMarriott, where the deltaV design team is meeting.

Agreed that the proposed behaviour of PUT\nto a LOCKed auto-versioned resource should be to checkout the resource and\nupdate its contents without checking it back in.  Subsequent PUTs and\nPROPPATCHes would update the same (mutable) working resource.  Thw working\nresource would be checked in when the resource was UNLOCKed.\n\nDiscussed ways of working with client side workspaces.\nOne model is that clients acquire locks across all resources that they want\nto update, sends updates, then releases all the locks.  This is inherently\npessimistic, and isn't going to scale to updating large numbers of\nresources.\nAnother model is to use GET and PROPFIND to copy resources over to the\nclient machine.  Clearly clients must be stateful to maintain the resources\nand any subsequent changes to the resources made by the client.  (Clients\nmay check with the server to ensure that the changes are still\nnon-conflicting by considering the current server state.)  When time comes\nto make changes on the server the client checks out the versions, issues\nPUT and PROPPATCH to update the working resource on the server and CHECKIN\nthe working resource.  Note that working resources are required since there\nis no single method for setting properties and content simultaneously.\nSome servers may have a batch capability to atomically check in numerous\nresources atomically.\n\nIn both models for client side workspaces, servers are required to provise\nworking resources, however, in server side workspaces clients simply use\nworkspaces.\n\nIt was noted that we now have multiple ways of checking out a resource,\nLOCK+autoversion, CHECKOUT a version controlled resource, & CHECKOUT a\nversion.\n\nMutable versions can be suppurted by allowing clients that have a lock on a\nversion resource to update the contents and properties in place.\n\nAdvantage of this LOCK/UNLOCK behaviour is that dav level two clients can\nnow create new versions without needing new methods (they still require a\nversioning client to VERSION-CONTROL to resource initially) and without all\nintermediate states of their PUTs and PROPPATCHes being recorded in version\nhistory.\n\nShould clarify in the spec. that 'Overwrite : T' means update in place\n(thereby ignoring the RFC2518 semantics that call for an initial DELETE of\nthe destination).  Remove the 'Overwrite: update' option.\n\nShould require that the error response for new methods contains an XML body\nas defined in the spec. (for advanced error reporting) unless it has been\notherwise negotiated (via header(s) to be defined).  For existing methods\nwe probably have to adopt the existing error conditions (and advanced error\nreporting may have to opt-in).\n\nAgenda item: should consider moving SET-TARGET out of core.\n\nDiscussion of versioned resource vs. a version controlled resource (vcr)\nand why we need to distinguish between resources that can be modified and\nresources that cannot be modified in a LOCK-PUT-UNLOCK sequence (excepting\nmutable versions).  This is a candidate for the delta-v book of why.\n\nSuggested that we specify that allprop requests do not return any delta-v\nproperties -- rejected since it does not solve the allprop problem.\n\nDiscussed checking out in the context of a baseline.\nCreate a baseline resource, can then checkout a resource specifying a\nbaseline in the CHECKOUT body (i.e., the baseline 'contains' a working\nresource/collection).  All the members MUST be checked in before the\nbaseline can be checked in.  Add a DAV:checked-out property to return the\nworking resources in the baseline.\n\nConsider introducing a DAV:sub-baseline property?\n\nGeoff will write up the semantics of checkig out against a baseline and\npost it to the list for general comments.\n\nDiscussed versionig whole respositories --  a single baseline is created\nthat represents the entire state of all resources.  The state of the\nrepository is captured in the baseline history.\n\nSuggested that there be no branching in core, no labels in core, but that\nthere should be a version history available in core.\n\nShould separate the 'label' option from the client managed workspace\noption.  I becomes its own option.\n\nHow about a header to get the latest version in an activity?\nSuggest a REPORT against a version history to ask for the latest verswion\nin a given activity, the response includes a version URL (noted that you\ncan issue depth requests if the target is a collection).\n\nPost conditions may be better expressed as (inverse) pre-conditions in some\ncases.  In any case should add extended status error tags to postconditions\nto allow the server to illustrate that the post condition could not be met.\n\n6.1.1 Grammar href+ becomes href*\n\n6.11 <DAV:activity-must-exist/> precondition should be added.\n\nDiscussion of labels and baselines.\n\nDiscussion of defining a DAV:is-branch property on an activity to advise a\nclient whether the activity represents a branch or change set.  The\nproperty would have no impact on the server behaviour.  Alternative\nsuggestion was to define a DAV:is-change-set property that would require\nthe server to enfore there was only one version per history per activity.\nHowevr, it was noted that this would require a means for setting the\nproperty when the activity is created (defining a body to initialize\nproperties during MKACTIVITY?)\n\nJames H. agreed to write up his semantics differences between a chane set\nand a branch (both being sets of resources) and why it would be useful for\nservers to distinguish them.

Questioned whether it allowed passing arguments in a\nquery language? it was argued it is possible to do in XML and this may be\nused by DASL whereas a REPORT method would not.\n\nQuestioned whether core needs any reports, since the only report available\nin core (to get the version history tree) is easily deduced by following\nthe predecessor set.  Clarified that the predecessor set contains only the\nimmediate predecessors, so it would require multiple requests to obtain.\n\nSince the most common situation in core is linear history producing a\nnested XML response may be verbose/cumbersome.\n\nAdding version history resource to core?\nReported that someone didn't want to allocate a URL for history resources.\nObserved that this would be a reasonable addition since it would be the\nnatural resource to request the version tree report from.  If the report\nmethod were removed from core then there would not be any reports left in\ncore.\n\nReorganising the document.\nThe document has been split along lines of optional behaviour.  Compliments\nreceived from the floor for the new layout.  Question raised about whether\nit should be split into two documents and whether one should be a proper\nsubset of the other or if it should be duplicated.  Larry suggested that it\nis purely an editorial decision -- one doc is advantageous since it does\nnot require repeating the boilerplate text, however, a split doc gives a\nsmaller document for those people only interested in core and makes\nindividual revision of core and optional behaviour easier.\nThere is less need to split the document now that it has been restructured.\n\nShould introduce a section on what servers MUST implement to be considered\ncore compliant.  Suggestion that this be an appendix referenced from the\nintroduction.  Should include a definition of ?core? in the definitions\nsection.\n\nClient side and server side workspaces.\nRepresent two fundamental implementation choices.  A stateful client only\ncontacts the server when there is something to record in version history,\nhowever, since a resource has both content and properties there must be a\nworking resource on the server to ensure that there is a consistent\nresource that is publicly viewable.  Furthermore, some servers will require\nthat there is a batch update to numerous resources\nsimultaneously/atomically.\nServer side workspaces appeal to clients with no state, the server must\nremember both the resource state and the names by which the client knows\nthe resources.\nGuestimate that up to 20% of servers can do both client-side and\nserver-side, however, clients will predominantly be doing just one or the\nother.\nOnce the checkin is completed, the clients? way of working is identical.\n\nQuestion: can servers support both stateful and stateless clients?  Answer:\nyes, but with difficulty.  Servers that can deal with client side state can\nquite easily deal with stateless clients (i.e., store the state on the\nserver).\nQuestion: Is the distinction between them (client side vs. server side)\nthat the client against a client side server can check out a resource\ntwice? Answer: No, both models support checking out 2 (or more) times\neither by using two workspaces or two working resources.\n\nGreg S.?s server will have activities, baselines, and stateful clients (to\nachieve high scalability), it also versions the entire repository (by\nefficient deltas of namespace and content/properties) to retain a coherent,\nversion-consistent, public state.\nWe need to combine the client-side workspaces with baselining; can checkout\na resource in the context of a baseline, then version the baseline (which\nchecks in all the working resources ? atomically).  The atomicity is\nimportant to ensure that consistency is maintained, and there is not a\npartial checkin state left on the server.  It is also required that the\nresult of the checkin can be made public atomically.\nQuestion: Is making the resources public an integral part of the checkin\natomicity?  Answer: Don?t know what Greg will be doing.  In current\nprotocol it would be two steps (1) to checkin the baseline and (2) to make\nthe baseline public (merge?)\n\nJim A. interjected and explained that these are detailed topics that may be\ndifficult to grasp ? people should study the list to get the issues being\ndebated.  Although clients may support both client side and server side\nworkspaces ? they are not like the other options that servers may add in\n(e.g., activities).\n\nWorking collections ? they are there to support client side workspaces that\nneed a place to acquire updates to a collection.\n\nAdding a ?latest version of a given version history in a given activity?,\nso that before you do a merge you can do a diff using the resources that\nwould have been selected by the merge method.\n\nDAV:must-support attribute.  Description of proposal to make it a token\npassed in an If: header.  Need to check the protocol to see if this\nbehaviour is required in the protocol, if not it can be dropped, and if it\nis the issue should be raise in the general WebDAV WG.  In either case\nremove it from delta-v.\n\nUse an explicit value to denote that the checkin date is unavailable.\nMaybe look at the XML schema work to see if they solve this problem.\nSuggestion that they do not, they only allow xml:null.  Specifying it to be\nDAV:unknown may be problematic since it would be a different type (in an\nXML schema).  Take the issue to the list.\n\nShould define which live properties a write lock protects.\nShould enumerate which live properties can be changed on a version?  Maybe\nuseful.\nChanging dead properties must require the server create a new version, live\nproperties may or may not.  Servers may define new live properties and it\nis up to them to decide if it creates new versions.\nSupported-live-properties has an impact on RFC2518 this should be raised on\nthe webdav list.\n\nComment that XML schema have already agreed on using ?true? and ?false?,\nRFC2518 use ?T? and ?F?, which should delta-v use?  Agreement that we\nshould defer to whatever RFC2518 uses (without re-specifying it in delta-v\nprotocol doc.)  Noted that RFC2518 doesn?t use ?T? and ?F? in an XML body,\nonly in a header value so that doesn?t help for validating XML parsers.\nJust state that the value is ?like RFC2518 or successors?.\n\nDiscussion on whether or not a version URL can be reused.  Lisa?s\nimplementation will count up from one for each time the resource at a given\nURL is brought under version control.  It remains the responsibility of the\nclient to check the equivalence of the resource state using Etags.\nQuestion: Since properties and content cannot change in a version, why\nshould clients need to check an Etag.  Support from the floor for reusing\nversion URLs.  Larry suggested that the spec say that ?version URLs SHOULD\nNOT be reused?.  Lisa believes that clients should ALWAYS use Etags to\nensure that resources have not changed.  Comment that this is impractical\nin circumstances where only a URL is supported (not a URL/Etag pair) such\nas links, server side includes, existing APIs, etc.\n\nJim A. opened up to the floor to ask where the working group should go from\nhere.  We?ve had some feedback on working group last call, and we want to\nmove to proposed standard last call in January.  Suggestion that we make\nthe changes discussed in the meeting and go to last call in one month.\nLarry?s comment was that it depends upon how quickly these items can be put\ninto the doc. And the existing open issues resolved, but that a further two\nweek discussion period should be ample and will encourage people to get it\ndone.  Once the WG last call has been made and there are no open issues,\nsend it to the ISG.\n\nLisa presented an e-mail about the overwrite header semantics, which lead\ninto a general discussion about COPY and MOVE semantics in a versioning\nworld.\n\nMeeting closed at 5:30pm.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-14004923"}, {"subject": "Re: Minutes Delta-V breakout meeting 14-Dec-0", "content": "On Fri, Dec 15, 2000 at 04:03:50PM +0000, Tim_Ellison@uk.ibm.com wrote:\n>...\n> Discussion of defining a DAV:is-branch property on an activity to advise a\n> client whether the activity represents a branch or change set.

In each of\nthese cases, having that URL get rebound to something that does\nnot reliably capture the appropriate state would violate the\nsemantics of these properties.\n\nNow we could have special case rules such as \"if a version URL appears\nin any DAV:predecessor-set or DAV:successor-set or DAV:version-set of\nany resource, then that version URL MUST NOT refer to anything other\nthan that version\", or even worse, we could require that each of\nthese properties contain both a URL and an etag for every version,\nand force every client to check the validity of the URL, but it\ncertainly would be friendlier to a client to have the server do the\nwork (especially since nobody has argued that this is hard for a\nserver to do).\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n   From: \"Lisa Dusseault\" <lisa@xythos.com>\n\n   I now understand Boris' use-case, but it applies equally to regular URLs.\n   I'd like to treat version-URLs much like existing URLs.\n\n    - You get a URL somehow\n\n    - You GET the content behind the URL from the server.\n\n    - If you've seen it before, you might have the ETag and know if it's\n   different.\n\n    - If you haven't seen it before, you won't have the ETag and can't tell.\n    - If the target content was deleted and re-created with the same URL,\n   that's life.\n\n   Why do version URLs have to be different from existing URLs?  Why are\n   versions special in that clients have to know if the content has changed --\n   in a different way than is already used for regular URLs (ETags)?  Let's not\n   solve this problem in a different way!\n\n   Since Boris' use-case applies to regular URLs equally well as to version\n   URLs, AND since you can even consider it a feature that one can replace the\n   content behind a static URL with new content, then a general solution would\n   seem to be the answer.  And I think the general solution is in hand.  As\n   with regular URLs, if a user intends for something to be the _same_\n   document, they use the same URL.  Nothing stops users from replacing the\n   content behind a URL.  URLs are static even though the content behind them\n   is dynamic; so if a document creator reused the same URL, when they can so\n   easily use a different one, clearly they intended to reuse the same URL.\n\n   lisa\n\n   > -----Original Message-----\n   > From: ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org\n   > [mailto:ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org]On Behalf Of Clemm, Geoff\n   > Sent: Friday, December 15, 2000 5:54 PM\n   > To: ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org\n   > Subject: RE: II.6, non-reusable version URLs (was: comments on\n   > deltav-10.5 from Yaron Goland, Act Two)\n   >\n   >\n   > Lisa asked for a use case that\n   > motivated requiring that version URL's not be\n   > re-used (she suggests having a client that cares\n   > just use the etag).

It's just not practical to send me the ETag as well,\n   because there is no easy way for me to check it. I think I would prefer\n   clicking on a URL such as\n   http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/advanced-status-reporting.htm/0074\n   1ab6a2c400141e860000c0a80cc2\n   or\n   http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/advanced-status-reporting.htm?vers\n   ion=1&etag=1fe4-69-39e7056c\n   over checking the ETag myself.\n\n   With reusable version URLs, users would need to know about ETags. Example:\n   If you accidentally deleted advanced-status-reporting.htm and then\n   re-created it, a URL which just\n   says ?version=1 would link to the latest version of that document instead\n   of the first version.\n\n   -Boris.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-14082731"}, {"subject": "Re: Minutes Delta-V breakout meeting 14-Dec-0", "content": "   From: \"Lisa Dusseault\" <lisa@xythos.com>\n\n   The reason why \"core\" versioning servers, e.g. document management servers,\n   need a way to list existing versions (what I think is meant by \"version\n   history\")  is because you need a way to tell the client what the URLs for\n   previous versions are.

Version histories do not add anything to our system at this point.\nWe will support the version-tree, though.\n\nThat said: I *do* know how/what a version history resource would be within\nour system, and could provide the functionality; it is simply that the\nclient doesn't need it at this time.\n\n[ and, in fact, I don't see its purpose in general. if you could somehow\n  browse and acquire an HREF to a history, then you'd have a resource that\n  tells you a bunch of version resources. But that doesn't tell you anything\n  about the version-controlled resources (e.g. they're layout/structure, how\n  they were made visible to users). So basically, you have an unstructured\n  index to some data, but without a way to properly structure it.

There is the mapping problem back to the\nversion-controlled resources (VCR).\n\nHmm. I guess \"detached\" version histories aren't useful. When they are still\nhooked in via a VCR, then it handy because you can link from a VCR to a\nhistory to versions within a property report.\n\nOh, whoops. I think that I will have version histories.

I'm also not going to suggest\nthe *-set properties, since they could be computed and will change from time\nto time.\n\nThe properties above are all (typically) immutable. It would be nice to have\na MUST for these, and then a SHOULD for others (or even punt the others).\nPunting all others would satisfy Geoff's concern about people blurring the\ndistinction between the resources. Avoiding the *-set properties will also\nhelp out with the remote system issue.\n\nYet, *having* these can provide great benefits to the client.

REPORT is for fetching information\nabout the server, its layout/organization, for multiple disparate resources\nand data, etc.\n\n> Greg, your example below could be done without any extension to WebDAV as \n> your client can ask for the information it needs by doing PROPFINDs with \n> depth on a collection.\n\n\"could\" being the operative word. Whether it \"should\" is a different matter.\n\nConsider the case where the client has a working copy where all the\nresources correspond to v7 from the repository. The repository is now at v9.\nThe client sends a report that contains something like:\n\nREPORT /repos/my-project HTTP/1.1\n...\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<S:upgrade-report xmlns:S=\"...\">\n  <S:directory name=\".\" version=\"7\"/>\n</S:upgrade-report>\n\nThe server then returns a report detailing all the new version resource\nURLs, of all the resources in the repository, for the client to remember.\nSome of those will also be marked as needing to be fetched because there is\na difference between v7 and v9. (note that most of the content won't change\nbetween v7 and v9; just the version resource URLs)\n\nThe REPORT marshalling is *extremely* more efficient than crawling over the\nrepository doing PROPFINDs.\n\nCheers,\n-g\n\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> I find that using PROPFIND rather than REPORT is a big bogus.

The PROPFIND that I'm using is a Depth:1\n   request. I'm fetching the props for a whole bunch of resources. If I\n   switched to a REPORT, then I'd need to do a PROPFIND on a collection to get\n   all the children, then a PROPFIND/REPORT to link thru the target to get the\n   props off the version resource.

It currently just says \"if a Depth header is\nspecified, a 207 multistatus MUST be returned\".  It should say that\nthe report results should be marshalled in the \"prop\" elements of the\n207 multistatus.  We could define our own 2xx \"multi-report\" return\nvalue, but just re-using the 207 seems simpler.\n\nIn fact, if people care, we could extend the REPORT method to allow\nyou to request multiple reports at the same time.

I'd only get the internal members)\n   [ and I'm not truly suggesting this new property, but it is certainly an\n     interesting item to ponder... ]\n\nExcept for the filtering out the collection itself,\nthis is what you can do with a Depth header on the REPORT.\n\nAnd yes, it is pretty silly that there is no Depth value that says\n\"just my immediate children\".  That's probably what Depth=1 *should*\nhave meant.  Oh well ...\n\n   Well, the simple issue in my mind is \"I've got this (VC) resource here, but\n   I don't know what it is [without the version-name].\" There is a non-trivial\n   amount of work to go and fetch that version-name; if it had simply been\n   exposed via the VCR, then I'd be fine.\n\n   I'd think the following properties are \"important\" to have appear on the\n   VCR, and a statement that they MUST be the same:\n\n     DAV:version-name\n     DAV:checkin-date\n     DAV:comment             (*)\n     DAV:creator-displayname (*)\n     DAV:version-history\n     DAV:version             (+)\n\n   (*) actually, the VCR could define these itself, so these might be confusing\n   to have appear on the VCR.\n   (+) this is unchanging, but is just a copy of the DAV:target prop  (??)\n\n   There are some informational properties: checkin-fork, checkout-fork, and\n   mutable; I don't have any feelings about them.

A\nREPORT on a \"baseline\" may well give a bunch of information on the baseline\nand the things the baseline is involved in.  Is that depth infinity?  Does\ndepth 1 make sense?

A REPORT request could target\nsomething more ephemeral like \"all baselines in this collection\" which is\nnot the same thing as depth infinity on the collection.  It's not like a GET\nor a MKCOL where there's a clear model of the resource being targetted.\n\n2)  Multiple targets of REPORT:  E.g. \"merge-preview-report\" in deltav draft\n10.  What would depth header mean on this request?  The \"target\" of the\nreport is not a single resource or collection, but a combination of some\nthings being merged into other things.  When a combination of things is\nspecified in the request, the depth header is ambiguous.

My three\n   (somewhat related) worries:\n\n   1) Lack of clear model: Although depth makes sense when we're\n   dealing with well-modelled collections and resources, the model\n   here is less clear.  A REPORT on a \"baseline\" may well give a bunch\n   of information on the baseline and the things the baseline is\n   involved in.  Is that depth infinity?  Does depth 1 make sense?  A\n   REPORT request could target the whole server (e.g. a report asking\n   for all orphaned resources).  A REPORT request could target\n   something more ephemeral like \"all baselines in this collection\"\n   which is not the same thing as depth infinity on the collection.\n   It's not like a GET or a MKCOL where there's a clear model of the\n   resource being targetted.\n\nYes, we do need to make it clear that Depth on a REPORT just means\nrunning that report on every member of the request collection (just\nlike PROPFIND).  A baseline is not a collection, so a Depth header has\nno effect on a request on a baseline (other than possibly changing the\nresponse status to a 207).\n\nSo I believe a Depth REPORT has a clear model, but that we need to add\na sentence to the protocol to make it unambiguous.\n\n   2) Multiple targets of REPORT:  E.g. \"merge-preview-report\" in deltav draft\n   10.  What would depth header mean on this request?  The \"target\" of the\n   report is not a single resource or collection, but a combination of some\n   things being merged into other things.  When a combination of things is\n   specified in the request, the depth header is ambiguous.  It could apply to\n   any, all, or none.\n\nHere as well, the merge-preview-report is just applied separately to\neach member of the request collection.  This is a well-defined\noperation.\n\nOn the other hand, your question did highlight the fact that MERGE\nhandles the Depth header somewhat specially, when logically, it\ndoesn't have to.  It probably is worth cleaning this up, by defining\nMERGE with a Depth header to be just a MERGE applied to each member of\nthe request collection.\n\n   3) REPORT on specific kind of resource: it seems that even when a\n   report targest only one resource, it's often a resource of a very\n   particular kind.  For example, one could have a report which only\n   made sense for a baseline, or a report which only made sense for a\n   versioned resource.  If depth: 1 or depth: infinity were specified,\n   what about items within that depth that aren't the right kind of\n   resource for this kind of report?\n\nThat's the same as any other Depth operation.

In particular, a client knows that when it\napplies a method to a resource, the only properties it needs to\nre-fetch (to reflect the result of that method) are the properties of\nthe resource itself.\n\nAnother advantage of these criteria is that they are consistent with\nthe currently standardized live properties (so they don't \"break\"\nexisting implementations).\n\nA more subjective advantage of these definitions is that I believe\nthey correspond to many people's intuition about what is a property\nand what is a report. In particular, a \"dead property\" is clearly a\nproperty.\n\nIf we use these criteria, a few of the current versioning \"properties\"\nwould need to become reports (e.g. DAV:successor-set,\nDAV:checkout-set, DAV:baselined-collection-set).  This actually would\nsimplify the protocol, since we no longer would need the\npost-conditions on MOVE and DELETE that say these properties\nare updated when a resource they contain is moved or deleted.\n\nComments?\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-14418413"}, {"subject": "Re: live props on a VC", "content": "> In fact, if people care, we could extend the REPORT method to allow\n> you to request multiple reports at the same time.

It would\nbe great if that could be formalized, along with a response body for the\nCHECKIN.\n\nThe motivation is pretty simple: the CHECKIN can construct a *bunch* of new\nversion resources. It would be nice to have the CHECKIN return that\ninformation to you (since it already has it), then for the client to go\ncrawling back over the server fetching all that data.\n\nThe interesting question, of course, is what resource the DAV:prop applies\nto. Is it the version selector? No, because those aren't involved in the\ncheckout or checkin (we originally checked out version resources). So it is\nmost likely going to refer to the new version resource. I'm fine with that,\nas I can get the DAV:version, DAV:getetag, and DAV:version-name properties\nfrom that and be okay.\n\nBut depending on what you CHECKIN, I could see the DAV:prop potentially\napplying to different items. IMO, it would always apply to the newly-created\nversion resource(s).\n\nCheers,\n-g\n\n-- \nGreg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-14688097"}, {"subject": "Re: PROPFIND instead of REPOR", "content": "> I'm sure Boris meant something like:\n> \n> http://dav.example.org/foo/document.htm?version-history\n> \n> as the URL for the version history resource, since\n> \n> /http://dav.example.org/foo/document.htm\n> \n> is the URL for the version-controlled resource.\n\nYes.

Just having that URL is no longer enough. (all related to the\nweakening from MUST to a SHOULD)\n\nIt seems that your argument simply revolves around convenience. We've got\nsome pretty good use cases from Boris on simply using a URL to refer to a\nresource. If that URL suddenly refers to something else... eek. And there'd\nbe no way to tell since the darn etag isn't passed along with the URL.\n\nI think that your argument about \"clients dealing with version resources\" is\nsomewhat specious. I can argue that a client will fetch the version\nresource, get an etag, and that it will continue to have that etag forever.\nFurther, a client won't \"want to see if the body has changed\" if it already\npresumes the version resource is immutable. If you have some downlevel\nbrowser, then it will check the etag, but will always find it unchanged.\n\nNow... if a server advertises version resources as mutable, then yah:\nclients damn well better start watching those etags. But I think the mutable\nstuff blows, so I don't care that servers with mutable versions could screw\nsome clients :-)\n\nCheers,\n-g\n\n-- \nGreg Stein, http://www.lyra.org/\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-14738890"}, {"subject": "Re: PROPFIND instead of REPOR", "content": "Geoff Clemm wrote:\n\n> Note that we need to be a bit careful with the terms\n> \"refer\" and \"latest\" in this context.

Each VCR would have its own URL, so the\nnumber of valid URLs in 'the system' even for a single version will be n+m!\n\nI think we _do_ have to talk about the number of resources created.\nAssume a single versionable resource.  After the initial VERSION-CONTROL\nmethod is applied, three resources are created:\n  - a version, containing a copy of the content and dead properties of the\nversionable resource,\n - a VCR, containing a copy of the content and dead properties of the\nversion/versionable resource,\n - a version history, containing properties that refer to the version. (not\npresently in core).\n\nFrom here clients can create new versions (CHECKOUT & CHECKIN) and create\nnew VCRs (VERSION-CONTROL) independently.\n\nHowever, version histories seem to provide little functionality.  They can\nanswer all the version URLs (which may be difficult for a distributed\nserver to compute anyway), the initial version (which could be deduced as\nthe version with no predecessor*), and the latest version (just the\nchronologically latest checkin-time, also difficult when distributed).\nBeyond that, histories provide a 'handle' to the versions when all the VCRs\nhave been deleted -- I suggest that this role could equally be played by\nany version (by following predecessor-successor references).\n\n*-presently the DAV:predecessor set is unprotected and so multiple versions\ncould have no predecessor.

A bazillion requests is a lot of requests.\n\n   Hmm. I just thought of something. Assume you have two people: Joe checks in\n   a bunch of stuff, creating new version resources.

For example, \"this dir (and\neverything in it) is v7, except <this> file is v8 and <that> is v6.\" The\nserver then returns info for each item that needs to be updated. These\nupdates are in one of two forms:\n\n1) the client side resource is up to date, except its version has changed.\n   <here> is the new version URL and version-name (where the version-name is\n   actually the repository-global version number)\n\nor\n\n2) the resource is out of date. here is the version URL and version-name.\n   [ the client then fetches a diff to patch from the old version up to the\n     new version ]\n\nCase (1) happens a lot when you have global version numbers (foo.c gets\nupdated, which causes a global version bump, which means every version URL\nmust be updated to the new version number).

When you fetch, it just grabs the latest. We aren't\nactually making copies or updating VCRs at all. You could consider it a\n\"lazy update\", but even that is a bit false since there is no (cached) state\nassociated with the VCR.\n\n> > > The alternative is that CHECKOUT/CHECKIN fail because some client has a\n> VCR\n> > > locked and you cannot honour the auto 'latest' for them -- even\n> assuming\n> > > that you know on which server the VCR resides and can modify it.\n> >\n> > People can't lock stuff on my server :-), so I'm not worred about this.\n> \n> That would help but we can't alienate locking clients.\n\nSure. I'm just saying that auto-latest works for me since I can't get goofed\nup by a client locking a VCR.\n\nBut auto-latest seems moot given the MERGE changes. Then again, it might be\nnice for systems that don't support MERGE / activities. e.g. imagine CVS\nwith a DeltaV frontend (although its bozo per-file model would probably be\nokay cuz they'd probably be tweaking the VCR anyways).\n\n> > Hmm.

However,\nwe *can* place that repository anywhere in the server's URL space, so it is\ndefinitely possible that unversioned resources will exist on the *server*.\n\nFor example:\n\n   http://www.lyra.org/index.html    -- unversioned\n   http://www.lyra.org/svn/...       -- everything in here is versioned\n\nGiven that VERSION-CONTROL will be a simple no-op (based on Geoff's\ncomments), I will support that.

How do you implement labels as a COPY?\n\nSVN can do a copy-by-reference, so they're cheap as hell. I can label\nsomething simply by doing:\n\n  COPY http://www.lyra.org/svn/project\n  Destination: http://www.lyra.org/svn/labels/1.0a1\n\nAssuming nobody monkeys in the 1.0a1 tree, it will reflect the state of\n\"/svn/project\" at the time of the COPY. Of course, we can also apply a\nsimple ACL to prevent that monkeying (but then again: we might want to apply\nfixes to the alpha).\n\nThat said, I think we might do labels in the classic RCS/CVS sense simply\nfor the user-model aspect.

If the resource in theory supports the\nmethod but your server will never allow it, that's a 403 (Forbidden).\nIf there's something the user could do to the resource, that's a 409\n(Conflict), and you could return (DAV:must-be-checked-in).\n\n   It seems like a core server is awfully thin now.

While everything in that new collection is \"checked-in\"\nit can't be changed, which makes your \"copy-by-ref\" a very good\nimplementation for a \"baseline-controlled collection\".  When you MERGE\nactivities into that new collection, you have \"forked a new line of\ndescent\".

Hmm... yes, in\n   SVN, the two VCRs would point at the same version resource.

Well, guess what? :-)  SVN refers to\n   version resources and does the bubble up.\n\nYes, \"baselines\" or \"deep versions\" are there for when you want to bubble\nup (which is why I keep beating the \"baseline drum\" for subversion :-).\n\n   Well, I'm out of town until next Thursday. I'll ponder on the problem some\n   more. I suspect that the answer may revolve around \"what is in a collection\n   version? option 1 is version histories; option 2 is version resources.\" SVN\n   would be option 2, while other servers will prefer option 1 for the reasons\n   stated in the draft. This can make sense depending on how you want to view\n   collections... option (2) implies the collection is bindings to *specific*\n   members, while option (1) is just bindings.\n\n   Oh... Collection versions in option (2) are sub-baselines. Now that is\n   something to think on while I'm away...\n\nI don't think you'll need sub-baselines until you do\ncross-repository linking, but regular baselines should\nget you what you want.\n\n   And hey... do I ever get an acknowledgement in the draft? :-)\n\nThe informal criteria for \"design team acknowledgement\" was technical \nmailing list participation and attendance at at least 2 design meetings.\nI'd say that a flood (:-) of mail messages and responsibility for at least\ntwo of the features in the protocol (working collections, auto-checkin\nfor MERGE) calls for a change to the informal criteria ...\nso, what \"organization\" (if any) would you like to have appear\nnext to your name?\n\n   Happy holidays everyone!\n\nSame from me!

This is a rather\n   heavyweight operation in the SVN server:\n   - for all non-versioned resources in the activity, create new version\n     histories and initial versions\n   - check in all working resources\n   - update all VCRs to refer to the new version resources\n   - the VCRs are baseline-controlled, so the baseline selector is checked\n     out, a new baseline is created, and then the baseline is checked in.\n     (per S9.11, DAV:auto-baseline)\n   \n   The resulting baseline would refer to the proper set of version\n   resources, so we're fine so far.\n\n*) While SVN collections refer to specific versions, it could be possible to\n   leave that only to the baselines and to somehow construct a \"standard\"\n   collection version resource.\n\n   [ this might be difficult because in DeltaV, a new collection version is\n     created when the *set* of members is changed; in SVN, a new collection\n     version is created when the set changes *or* a member gets a new\n     version resource. The hard part is \"creating\" collection versions on\n     set-changes, but not member version changes. Now that I have thought\n     about it, it might not be possible to do this; if it *is* then it will\n     probably be quite expensive and it doesn't fit the model at all ]\n\n   [ hmm. an alternative would be to go ahead and create new collection\n     version resources even when \"no change\" has occurred in the set of\n     members. to a client, it simply sees spurious creation of collection\n     versions, but shouldn't have a real issue with it. ]\n   \n   Given the second model in the \"aside\" above, it would seem that we could\n   model a DeltaV collection version. A true SVN collection version would\n   only be exposed via a baseline.\n\n*) The problem: given a working collection, I need a way to specify that a\n   member is a specific version resource. The member may be furthered\n   modified before it is checked in. When the new (auto) baseline is\n   constructed, it will refer to the original version resource or to the\n   modified successor of that version resource.\n\n   Note that the member may be a collection or a non-collection resource.\n   (I state this because I think Geoff said to use a BASELINE-CONTROL for\n    this copy-by-ref thing, but that would only apply to a collection)\n\n\nMy ideal solution would be to allow collection versions, and thusly working\ncollections, to contain version resources *instead* of version histories.\nThis would solve the model disparity for collection versions. However,\nputting a version resource into a working collection isn't quite right...\nThat would prevent a change of the copy-by-ref'd resource before it was\nchecked in. It almost seems that the needed model would be a working\nresource where the DAV:checked-out property is the copied version resource.\nBut that might spawn a new version resource even when we don't make any\nchanges...\n\nsigh. Here would be an ideal sequence of semantic operations:\n\n1) CHECKOUT a collection version (within an activity)\n2) \"copy\" a specific version resource into the working collection; the copy\n   should also be a version resource, tied to the same version history. In\n   fact, using the BIND method is pretty close: construct a new URL for a\n   given version resource.\n3) somehow \"checkout\" the \"new\" version resource to create a working\n   resource\n4) PUT/PROPPATCH changes to that working resource\n5) MERGE the activity\n\nYes... steps (2) and (3) are the hard part.\n\n\nI'm all for fitting into the existing DeltaV model(s), but I can't see how.\n\nHmm. What if I copy/bind/whatever a version resource (\"VR\") into the working\ncollection (\"WC\"). If changes are needed, then I do a CHECKOUT on VR and a\nworking resource (\"WR\") is returned. PUT/PROPPATCH request(s) are performed\non WR. At checkin/merge time, the server understands that WR corresponds to\nVR. The new collection version (or baseline; the actual new \"thing\" seems to\nbe moot here) is created to refer to VR, or to VR' (resulting from the\ncheckin of WR).\n\nIt may also be that a version-controlled resource would go into WC which\ninitially points at the original version resource. However, this creates\nproblems when we go to check out that version resource to make further\nchanges. That would lose the association between WC and the \"new\" member.\nBut the nice part about the VCR is that it can point to VR'. Otherwise,\nthere is a need to \"replace\" VR (within WC) with VR'.\n\n\nObviously... I haven't figured out the best way to model this (within the\nexisting DeltaV or figuring out how it needs to change).

Now that I have thought\nabout it, it might not be possible to do this; if it *is* then it will\nprobably be quite expensive and it doesn't fit the model at all ]\n\n      [ hmm. an alternative would be to go ahead and create new collection\nversion resources even when \"no change\" has occurred in the set of\nmembers. to a client, it simply sees spurious creation of collection\nversions, but shouldn't have a real issue with it. ]\n\nYes, this alternative would be fine.\n\n      Given the second model in the \"aside\" above, it would seem that we could\n      model a DeltaV collection version. A true SVN collection version would\n      only be exposed via a baseline.\n\nYes, an \"SVN collection version\" is what DeltaV calls a \"collection baseline\".\n\n   *) The problem: given a working collection, I need a way to specify that a\n      member is a specific version resource.\n\nIt's true that a client needs to know what version it is looking at,\nbut I don't see that it needs to get this information from a working\ncollection (the client just keeps a list of the versions that it has).\n\n      The member may be furthered\n      modified before it is checked in.\n\nThat's fine, but there is no need to check it out \"in the context of\nthe working collection\" ... just check out that version directly.\n\n      When the new (auto) baseline is\n      constructed, it will refer to the original version resource or to the\n      modified successor of that version resource.\n\nThat happens because the activity contains the working resource ...\nno need for the working collection to contain the working resource.\n\n      Note that the member may be a collection or a non-collection resource.\n      (I state this because I think Geoff said to use a BASELINE-CONTROL for\n       this copy-by-ref thing, but that would only apply to a collection)\n\nAs long as it is a working resource, it will be in the checkout-set of\nthe activity, the new version will be captured by the new baseline and\nbecause of the semantics of the MERGE operations, will become the\nDAV:checked-in version of the appropriate version selector.\n\n   My ideal solution would be to allow collection versions, and thusly working\n   collections, to contain version resources *instead* of version histories.\n\nNo need for this change.  Activities contain versions, and baselines\ncontain versions, which should be all the version containment that\nyou need.\n\n   This would solve the model disparity for collection versions. However,\n   putting a version resource into a working collection isn't quite right...\n   That would prevent a change of the copy-by-ref'd resource before it was\n   checked in. It almost seems that the needed model would be a working\n   resource where the DAV:checked-out property is the copied version resource.\n   But that might spawn a new version resource even when we don't make any\n   changes...\n\nYou are about to get lost in a maze of twisty passages, all of which\nlook alike ... don't go there (:-).\n\n   sigh. Here would be an ideal sequence of semantic operations:\n\n   1) CHECKOUT a collection version (within an activity)\n\nYes.\n\n   2) \"copy\" a specific version resource into the working collection; the copy\n      should also be a version resource, tied to the same version history. In\n      fact, using the BIND method is pretty close: construct a new URL for a\n      given version resource.\n\nYou would need to \"bind\" the appropriate version history into the\nworking collection, not \"copy\" a version into it (which would create\na new version history, not link you to an old one).\n\nBIND would be the most direct way (the DeltaV spec is my highest\npriority, then the ACL spec, and then BIND ... I'm hoping JimW will get\nthe BIND editing done, but having your first baby does tend to absorb\nquite a bit of time (:-), so I may end up getting to it before he does.\n\nAlternatively, you can just CHECKOUT a collection version that\ncontains the desired version history (creating a second working\ncollection), MOVE the desired version history from the second working\ncollection into the first working collection, and then DELETE the\nsecond working collection.  This achieves the result of a BIND\nwithout actually using the BIND method.\n\n   3) somehow \"checkout\" the \"new\" version resource to create a working\n      resource\n\nThat's the easy part.  You just checkout that version resource, to get\na new working resource.\n\nYou don't need anything more than the implict connection between the\nworking collection and the working resource (i.e.  the working\nresource checks out a version whose version history is now a member of\nthe working collection).\n\n   4) PUT/PROPPATCH changes to that working resource\n\nYup.\n\n   5) MERGE the activity\n\nYup.\n\n   Yes... steps (2) and (3) are the hard part.\n\nStep (3) is easy, so that just leaves step (2) to think about.\nIf you just use the BIND protocol (it's going to happen, so you won't\nbe *that* far in front of the crowd), step (2) is simple as well.\nOr if you don't want to have a BIND dependency, just use the\nCHECKOUT, MOVE approach, which isn't too bad.\n\n   I'm all for fitting into the existing DeltaV model(s), but I can't see how.\n   Hmm. What if I copy/bind/whatever a version resource (\"VR\") into the working\n   collection (\"WC\").\n\nBIND the version history in, and you've got the collection change done.\n\n   If changes are needed, then I do a CHECKOUT on VR and a\n   working resource (\"WR\") is returned.\n\nYes (but there's no need for the working collection to be involved in this\nversion checkout).\n\n   PUT/PROPPATCH request(s) are performed on WR.\n\nYes.\n\n   At checkin/merge time, the server understands that WR corresponds to\n   VR.\n\nIt's true that the DAV:checked-out property of a WR identifies the VR\nthat was checked out.\n\n   The new collection version (or baseline; the actual new \"thing\" seems to\n   be moot here) is created to refer to VR, or to VR' (resulting from the\n   checkin of WR).\n\nWell, it's actually very important to get the \"thing\" right to get\ninteroperability, so let's go with \"baseline\".  Then, yes, the new\ncollection baseline will refer to VR' (because the MERGE updates\nthe version-controlled resource to have VR' as its DAV:checked-in\nversion, which means that VR' is added to the DAV:version-set of\nthe new baseline.\n\n   It may also be that a version-controlled resource would go into WC which\n   initially points at the original version resource. However, this creates\n   problems when we go to check out that version resource to make further\n   changes. That would lose the association between WC and the \"new\" member.\n   But the nice part about the VCR is that it can point to VR'. Otherwise,\n   there is a need to \"replace\" VR (within WC) with VR'.\n\nThe MERGE takes care of getting VR' into the new baseline, so there's\nno need to get it into the working collection.\n\n   Obviously... I haven't figured out the best way to model this (within the\n   existing DeltaV or figuring out how it needs to change). Any thoughts?\n\nLet me know if any of this doesn't work for you.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-15343795"}, {"subject": "Re: shared version historie", "content": "   From: Greg Stein <gstein@lyra.org>\n\n   I'm seeing some issues in the draft when a namespace has two VCRs that refer\n   to versions from the same history.\n\n   For example, let's say that I have a version history with:\n\n       V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4\n\n   In the VCR namespace:\n\n     /coll/foo.c -> V2\n     /coll/bar.c -> V4  [copied from foo.c, then extended]\n\nIf it really was \"COPY\"d, then foo.c and bar.c would be in different\nversion histories, by the semantics of COPY.  You'd have to use\nBIND or the MOVE trick to get this situation.\n\nNote though, that if /coll were a workspace, this could not happen,\nbecause you cannot have two different version controlled resources\nwith the same version history in the same workspace.  (You could have\ntwo bindings to the same version-controlled resource, but then they\nwould share the same DAV:checked-in version).\n\n   I see two problems arising from this now:\n\n   1) a MERGE request is going to have problems because it doesn't know which\n      VCR to update when bar.c is moved from V4 to V5. foo.c also refers to the\n      same version history, so the MERGE may want to update that to V5, too.\n\nYes, that is why this is not allowed to happen in a workspace.\n\n      [ based on my understanding of MERGE which says \"update all VCRs which\nrefer to the version history of the merge version (V5)\". in this case,\ntwo VCRs do. ]\n\nCurrently the protocol is not explicit about what happens in this\nsituation (i.e. it talks about \"the\" merge target).  This means\nthat currently, a server could call it an error, update just some\nof the VCR's, or update all of the VCR's.\n\n   2) I have a change set style of an activity. The resulting version history\n      should look like:\n\n       V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4 -> V5\n       \\\nV2.1\n\n      But the limitations imposed on activities prevents two versions in the\n      same line of descent. (but the point is *after* the change set is\n      applied, I want two lines of descent)\n\nYou can have multiple lines of descent, but V2.1 is not allowed to be\nin the same activity as V3, V4, or V5.\n\n      [ oh, wait a sec. DAV:unreserved fixes this ]\n\nDepends what you mean by \"fixes\".  DAV:unreserved just lets thing\nbranch in the same activity at CHECKOUT time.  You cannot CHECKIN\nsomething (whether or not it is reserved) if it would cause a fork\nin an activity.\n\n   I have a feeling that problem (1) could be lessened because V5 was created\n   by checking in a change against V4, so we only update VCRs that refer to V4.\n\nIn general, you can update a VCR to any other version from the version\nhistory of that VCR (skipping forward, backward, or sideways in the\nhistory is all legal), so only updating a VCR if it currently has\nthe predecessor of the change would be a significant loss of functionality.\n\n   But that isn't actually in the draft, and it might not be desirable (MERGE\n   isn't always based on checking stuff in; it can also be used for workspace\n   management).\n\nYes.\n\n   Okay. (2) is moot. The introduction to activities is very misleading. It\n   says that versions in an activity must be on a single line of descent.\n   Twice. Well, that gets completely thrown out later when DAV:unreserved is\n   described. The introduction should say something about this to prevent\n   confusion (like I just did above).\n\nThe confusion must be in the definition of \"unreserved\", which needs to\nmake it very clear that the unreserved fork only applies to a checkout ...\nthe *versions* in an activity must be on a single line of descent, so the\ncheckout forking is only temporary.\n\n   I'll look for other issues with shared version histories, but this is my\n   start. Of course, there is also the problem of getting two references in\n   there in the first place (in the working collection model; it would appear\n   that the workspace model can just use VERSION-CONTROL to create the second\n   reference).\n\nYes, but not in the same workspace.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-15361195"}, {"subject": "RE: prop in a MERGE reques", "content": "Not sure what happened there.

Reduces the combinatorial explosion, helps QA and interop\ntesting. Four proposed packages: Base, File Versioning, Client CM,\nServer CM. Will have to be hashed out on the list, of course.\n\nIssues: should that be \"SHOULD implement B and C\"; how does the server\nadvertise which packages it support? Larry pointing out that,\nhistorically, one thing the IETF doesn't do well is protocols with a\nlot of independent options; packaging the options like this improves\ninterop a lot.\n\nMark: that you don't need any of these packages to implement\nversioning; you could just do automatic versioning, which is in the\ncore. Says we should have a package for the core, so that we could\nhave simple, noninteractive clients.\n\nLisa: an autoversioning client could run against a Base server.\n\nMark: core is \"sufficient to be deltav compliant\", so it should be\npermitted.\n\nLarry: the smaller subsets are interesting; leaning towards permitting\na Core package.\n\nGeoff: question is, is the cost of adding checkout and fork control,\nto be Base, is high enough to deter an implementor from going to Base.\n\nJimW: probably not; it's probably under 1000 lines of code.\n\nGeoff: right, because autoversioning has to do that checkout anyway,\neven if it doesn't expose it via deltav.\n\nLarry: if all packages have checkout & fork control (proposed\ndefinitions do), then why not redefine core to include them, and drop\nthe Base package?\n\nGeoff: some people he knows want to expose \"core\" as a feature, which\ncan advertised. Knows one server for whom it is very important to be\ncore-only.\n\nLarry: but is it useful to any client?\n\nGeoff: that server does not want to allow non-automatic versioning.\n\nChris trying to get the sense of the room.\n\nLarry: what kind of difference would this make to a client?\n\nLisa: not much; but it could well make a big difference for some servers.\n\n[...] Geoff: bundling the base features into core gives us less\nflexibility later; we wouldn't be able to fix it later.\n\nEric: some clients will be perfectly happy to deal with core-level\nservers.\n\nLarry: leaving them separate features is fine with him, but telling\nimplementors it's OK to leave them out.\n\nSeparate thread: Update and Label are not in any of the packages;\nthey're to be advertised separately.\n\nGeoff: they're not really orthogonal, though; they'd harm Client CM\nand Server CM.\n\nJimW: maybe {Client, Server} CM should imply \"MUST NOT support Update,\nLabel\".\n\nEric: Label might be harmless, actually.\n\n(Larry asking, and Geoff explaining, why Update is harmful.)\n\nEric: so, should File Versioning imply Update?\n\nChris: there are backends where File Versioning would be possible, but\nUpdate very difficult.\n\nLarry: get rid of Update, maybe?\n\nGeoff: let's take it to the list; its defenders aren't here.\n\nLarry: so what was it for?\n\nGeoff: well, it was needed back before we added some of the more\nadvanced CM capabilities; it might not be needed any more.\n\nShould we cut Label?\n\nJohn Stracke: without Label, it's going to be pretty hard to build on\ntop of CVS, which is important to a lot of people, esp. open-source\nprojects. Discussion over what to do; we might be able to define a\nsimpler degree of CM that CVS could do. One thing that makes Label\ncomplex is the Label: header (interacts with GET and PROPFIND; has to\nbe internationalized specially); but maybe we could cut\nthat. Discussion.\n\nSense of the room: remove the Label: header; possibly remove Update. \n\nJimW: could the simplified Label be rolled into any of these?\n\nGeoff: Certainly into {Client, Server} CM. \n\n\n** Open Issues **\n\n- Should COPY of collections delete destination elements not in source?\nThat's what 2518 says, but that's not what people expect, and not what\nfilesystems actually implement (they merge into the existing\ncollection). Define a header to request the merge behavior, or update\n2518?\n\nLarry: if we update 2518, it should be in a separate doc.\n\nJimW: the header option is what an early WebDAV draft did, and it\nsuccumbed to optionitis. But there might be clients that depend on the\ncurrent behavior. Action item: JimW will follow up on revving 2518.\n\n- Should we declare that no versioning properties are returned by allprop?\n\nJimW: why?\n\nGeoff: so that servers can avoid the cost of computing them,\nparticularly since most clients currently doing allprop are not\nversion-aware and won't be able to use the versioning\nproperties. (Side thread about deprecating allprop altogether. The\nnatural issues.) Discussion: what level should this requirement be?\n\nChris: some servers will find it easier to send everything (for one\nreason or another), and they shouldn't be required to filter.\n\nLarry: how is filtering going to be more expensive than generating &\nsending the XML?\n\n...Chris recording: sense of room: SHOULD NOT, with explanation.\n\n\n- Should the checkin on unlock create a new version if the resource has\nnot been changed while it was locked?\n\nGeoff: the spec for autoversioning says that checkout occurs on\nupdate, but not on lock.\n\nChris: let's make it optional, for stores that automatically check out\non lock.\n\nGeoff: but what if you do a depth lock, just to modify a single\nresource? It would be really inefficient. Also, clients need\npredictable behavior.\n\nChris recording: sense of the room: no, because the checkout doesn't\noccur until a modification is made.\n\n- Add UNVERSION-CONTROL request?\n\nJimW: just copy it to a non-version-controlled part of the namespace.\n\nChris: but this is something that'd be done in situ.\n\nLisa: this will destroy too much information.\n\nJimW: do you really want to add this new feature right when we're\ntrying to finish up?\n\nChris: somebody asked for it; we should address it.\n\nGeoff: yes, we're addressing it; but its utility is so low that it's\nbelow the bar for now.\n\nLarry: so what was the actual problem to be solved?\n\nLisa: I want a way to take a versioned resource and make it non-versioned.\n\nLarry: what's wrong with copying it away and then moving it back?\n\nLisa: it's not in situ, so it doesn't get logged properly. But...it's\na reasonable workaround; can we document it?\n\nChris recording: sense of the room: document the workaround. \n\n- Should we get rid of DAV:version-set property of a version history\n  resource?\n\nChris: why?\n\nLisa had pointed out that there were too many ways to get at the\nversion history; thought this one was one we could get rid of; but\nmaybe a different one would be better. Discussion; it comes out that\nthere are only two ways to get the entire history: version-set and a\nreport. Lisa had thought that the predecessor/successor properties had\nbeen \"all predecessors/all successors\".\n\nChris recording: sense of the room: clarify that pred/succ properties\nare immediate only, maybe add an implementation note for clients on\nthe best way to get history, explain that the different methods are\nequiv.\n\n- Should the DAV:version-controlled-configuration be on all members of\n  a baseline-controlled collection?\n\nGeoff explaining: version-controlled-configuration is the property of\na baseline-controlled collection that lets you create new\nbaselines. It's currently on the root; Greg Stein wanted to be able to\nuse it on any member.\n\nChris: was there any dissent when it came upon the list?\n\nGeoff: no.\n\nChris: any objection here?

I agree with Mark and Larry that Core is sufficient to\n   implement versioning, and with Eric that some clients will be\n   perfectly happy to deal with Core-level servers.  \n\nI agree with this as well.\n\n   So I believe\n   DeltaV should have a package which is just Core.\n\nIt's important to separate \"features\" (what we used to call \"options\")\nfrom \"packages\".  The consensus at the meeting was that a server\nreports its capabilities in the form of a set of features (in the DAV\nheader from an OPTIONS request).  In the protocol, we define a small\nset of feature sets, or \"packages\", that a server SHOULD support,\nas a way to simplify the creation of interoperable clients.\n\nThis means that a server MAY support just the \"version-control\"\nfeature, but not any of the defined packages.  On the other hand,\nto keep the interoperable client combinatorics in control, we\npropose to define a small number of \"packages\" that reflect a \nset of features that appear to cover the majority of planned\nimplementations.\n\n   I would not\n   replace Core with Basic.  Given that decision, I would rename Basic\n   to avoid the implication that it's the minimum package, or\n   otherwise make it clear that Core is the minimum.\n\nYes, all features require the \"version-control\" feature, which makes\nit the logical minimum set of versioning features.  But it is still\nreasonable to say that the smallest defined \"package\" consists of\nmore than that logical minimum set of versioning features.\n\nAlthough Lisa has recently posted a suggestion that we actually \nreturn package names in OPTIONS, rather than feature names, I do\nnot agree with this suggestion, and this suggestion was not\nsupported by the working group in Minneapolis.\n\n   I disagree with Geoff and JimW that adding checkout and fork control is\nlow\n   cost for any server wishing to be DeltaV-compliant.\n\nThe minutes are a bit misleading there.  I agreed that it is reasonable\nto have checkout and fork-control in the smallest defined \"package\",\nbut I did not agree that a server have to support this in order to\nadvertise any DeltaV support.  To the contrary, I believe as stated\nabove, namely that a server MAY just support the \"version-control\"\nfeature (which does not have CHECKOUT).\n\n   Recall that checkout\n   requires mutable VCRs on the server which hold intermediate state between\n   checkout and checkin, whereas Core has no such requirement.\n\nI agree.\n\n   Core allows all\n   server-resident resources to be immutable, which is arguably a more\n   consistent model than the mixed model with checkout (mutable checked-out\n   VCRs, everything else immutable).\n\nMore \"consistent\"?  I probably wouldn't go that far ... if you want to\nhave consistent property/content, unless you can come up with a way of\nupdating both in one HTTP request, you'll be creating inconsistent\nimmutable states on the server, which doesn't sound like a good thing\nto me.  This is why although I agree that a server MAY just support\nthe version-control feature, it SHOULD support CHECKOUT.\n\n   For existing versioning servers that\n   disallow mutable objects, the cost of supporting checkout is non-trivial,\n   because code would have to be written to subvert the fundamental design\nof\n   the server.\n\nI agree.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-15685842"}, {"subject": "draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-14.1 is now availabl", "content": "This draft contains all the changes discussed at the Minneapolis\nworking group meeting, except for the removal of the update feature.\n\n<http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-14.1.htm\n>\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-15696595"}, {"subject": "RE: Versioning TeleConf Agenda, 4/6/01 (Friday) 12-1pm ES", "content": "Attending: Peter(Merant), Boris(IBM), Geoff(Rational)\n\n   Agenda:\n\n   Discuss the changes proposed at the Minneapolis IETF\n\n   - split Variant into separate spec (no objections so far)\n\nNo objections in con-call.\n\n   - merge Fork-Control into Checkout (no objections so far)\n\nNo objections in con-call.\n\n   - define four \"feature-sets\" or \"option-sets\" (defined in earlier\nmessage)\n\nOk with con-call participants.\n\n   - defer label header, but keep LABEL method\n\nExample of reason why you don't want human meaningful strings in a\nheader:  The Label value needs to be matched against values stored \non the server.

Here's a brief summary:\n\nThe steps for preparing IDN domain names are:\n\n1. Input the domain name through some mechanism (outside the scope of the \ndocument)\n\n2. Do transformations on the input domain name for case folding, hyphen \nmapping, etc.\n\n3. Normalize the result (see \nhttp://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/tr15-21.html)\n\n4. Check for prohibited characters and return an error if any. Most of \nthese characters are things that cannot be displayed properly.\n\n5. Resolve the resultant domain name\n\nMany of the transformations applied above are specific to domain name \nsemantics. Labels in DeltaV have no associated semantics. They are only \nkeys that are to be used by the user and client applications any way they \nwant. The server applies no semantics to labels other than they are unique \namong the revisions of the same versioned resource. Uniqueness is \ndetermined strictly by byte-by-byte comparisons, not display names. \nRevisions have a separate display name property for this purpose.  There \nare no language transformations done on labels either. We make no attempt \nto process them in any way.\n\nNow if labels are used for display purposes, which many clients will \ncertainly do, we may run into problems with normalization since it is \npossible that different labels could be rendered the same, or different \nclients could take the same rendering and submit different label headers. \nFor maximum flexibility, we would like to leave such concerns to the \nclient applications that are providing the label semantics rather than \ndoing something in the protocol that might not meet all client needs. This \nis different than preparing internationalized domain names, because the \nsemantics are being specified.\n\nA number of members of the DeltaV working group (myself included) have \nexpressed a desire to keep the label header. I think we're tentatively OK \non using UTF-8 encoded strings, but I would welcome any further discussion \non the topic to be sure we're not going to regret the decision. If simple \nbyte-by-byte comparisons are not sufficient, we could attempt to solve the \nproblem through normalization and mapping rather than simply removing the \nlabel header.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrik F?ltstr?m <paf@cisco.com>\n04/10/2001 04:02 PM\n\n \n        To:     Jim Amsden <jamsden@us.ibm.com>, ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org, \nned@innosoft.com\n        cc: \n        Subject:        RE: label header (was: Re: Versioning TeleConf Agenda, 4/6/01 (Friday) \n12-1pm EST)\n\n \n\n--On 01-04-10 13.21 -0400 Jim Amsden <jamsden@us.ibm.com> wrote:\n\n> Perhaps we could get some clarification from the Application area\n> directors if this is something we need to address or not?

The final resolution was that every member of a\nbaseline-controlled collection got its own\nDAV:version-controlled-configuration property.

In the body of LABEL method, you can annotate the label\nwith as many internationalization attributes as it wishes, and you\nquery for labels with PROPFIND, which will give you all those\nattributes back.\n\n- Label matching\n\nHere is the area where the Label header does come into play, because\nit is the way several methods will pass in the label to be \"matched\".\nMy impression is that most of the members of the working group that\ncare about labels find a simple byte string matching of the label to\nbe sufficient for their needs.  It is OK for an Englishman to label a\nversion \"gross\", and then have this version be selected by a German\nthat asks for the \"large\" version (i.e.  \"gross\" in German, put please\ndon't get too concerned about the details of this example :-).\n\nThis is no more likely to happen than for some other client to use the\nword \"gross\" in English to mean something other than what the second\nclient had in mind.  In fact, it is probably much *more* likely for\nthe two different English uses of a string to collide, than it is for\nan English use to collide with a German use.\n\nClients that really care about his issue will just use baselines\ninstead of labels, since a baseline selection of a version can never\n\"collide\" with another baseline (which is why I think we should just\nget rid of the label feature altogether, but that's just me :-).\n\nSo if we accept all that, the only thing left to do is to decide which\npackages (if any) will contain the label header.  After staring at\nour current packages (core, basic/advanced client workspaces, and\nbasic/advanced servers workspaces), I believe it makes sense to bundle\nlabels into the \"client workspace\" packages.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows: I believe most client-workspace servers do\nin fact support labels, and Greg (who is known to be producing an\nadvanced-client-workspace server) was one of the vocal supporters of\nlabels.

Language is always\n   so slippery....\n\nWe did discuss the idea of explicitly adding in \"package\" tokens to be\nreturned by OPTIONS, but the consensus at the meeting was that\nreturning explicit \"package\" tokens from OPTIONS (in addition to\n\"feature\" tokens) would provide no additional benefit beyond simply\ndefining the package membership in the spec.\n\nThe rationale was that it's just as easy to check whether a set of\nfeature tokens are in the OPTIONS response as it is to check whether a\nsingle package token is in the OPTIONS response).\n\n   My assumption: If anybody can create a new \"feature set\" and inform the\n   world what their set is, then there's no value to feature sets.\n\nThat does not follow.  If the spec identifies 4 specific feature\nsets that a server SHOULD support, then a client is provided with\nguidance as to what 4 feature sets to look for.\n\n   I do, however, understand that some servers will want to support a\nfeature\n   set plus an extra feature or two.  So I propose that there be some way to\n   name each feature set, plus to name features on top.  Then the OPTIONS\n   response for my server would indicate:\n    - I support BASE feature set\n    - I also support features X and Y (which are not part of BASE)\n\nA client can answer the first question by just looking to see whether\nall the features in the BASE feature set came back from the OPTIONS\nrequest.  No need for a separate \"package\" token to be defined or\nreturned.\n\n   Another server might support BASE, feature X, Y and also Z.  If BASE + X\n+ Y\n   + Z == FEATURE_SET_1, then the OPTIONS response would only have one\nstring\n   for this server:\n    - I support FEATURE_SET_1\n\nSimilarly, it's just as easy for a client to check whether all features\nin FEATURE_SET_1 have been returned in the OPTIONS response from the\nserver.\n\n   Also, I would propose that BASE replace the concept of CORE.  It's way\ntoo\n   confusing to have a difference.  BASE should be the set of features that\nall\n   servers must implement:  the old concept of core, plus checkout, plus\n   fork-control parsing (even if disallowed).\n\nCORE is the intersection of the features supported by all defined\npackages.  This turns out to just be one feature, namely, the\nversion-control feature.  It doesn't matter much to me whether we\ngive that single common feature its own package name, as long as\nwe clearly identify that this is the only feature that is common\nbetween all packages.\n\n   Taking these steps puts few actual restrictions on the servers.  They can\n   still decide to support an arbitrary set of features.  There is only a\n   psychological pressure (which I think is a good thing) to implement a\n   defined package rather than a random set of features.  The next value of\n   this is that it's much easier for a client to identify their supported\n   feature sets.\n\nI believe that the difference in coding effort and complexity between:\n\n   for (feature in package)\n     check-if-feature-supported (feature, supported-feature-set)\n\nand\n\n   check-if-package-supported (package, supported-package-set)\n\nis not sufficient to warrant adding package tokens to the OPTIONS\nresponse.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-16072984"}, {"subject": "RE: The Label header, and other issues raised since draft-1", "content": "> - Internationalizable display of labels:\n>\n> This actually has little to do with the label header, since you don't\n> use the label header to create labels, but rather use the body of the\n> LABEL method.

Especially\n   the the first sentence and the stuff on components which seems to\n   imply that you have to move it out of the baseline scope to create\n   a subbaseline.\n\nGood point!  (I did realize that the subbaseline stuff needed to\nbe reworded, but I didn't notice that the first sentence also needs\nto be changed ... thanks for pointing that out!).\n\n   BTW, I agree with your roadmap for 15. That also means that I can\n   accept a language attribute for labels. But please NO additional\n   comparison rules if we can avoid it.\n\nAgreed.  The language attributes are there for display purposes,\nbut do not affect the matching (which is simple UTF-8 byte comparison).\n\n   I already shudder when I\n   think about the question whether two strings which are identical\n   but have nominally a different encoding (UTF8 or ASCII7) match.  So\n   would it be possible to say a label must be in UTF8 and optionally\n   a language attribute is allowed ?\n\nWe do require that the label be in UTF-8 when it appears in a\nheader.  We don't require UTF-8 in the XML, because we want to\njust use standard XML language encoding rules (which among other\nthings, allows a language attribute).  But the transformation\nbetween other Unicode encodings and UTF-8 are well defined.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-16155270"}, {"subject": "RE: checked-out VCC: A new proposa", "content": "   From: Fay, Chuck [mailto:CFay@filenet.com]\n\n   Overall, I prefer the previous DAV:auto-version property and its\n   settings, because the four possible settings were all well-defined.\n   With the proposed property tuple (DAV:auto-checkout,\n   DAV:auto-checkin) replacing DAV:auto-version, there appear to be\n   thirty-two possible settings of the tuple.\n\nActually, the four possible values:\n auto-checkout=unlocked-update\n auto-checkout=locked-update\n auto-checkin=unlocked-update\n auto-checkin=locked-update\nare independent of each other, so there are no combinatorics involved\nhere.\n\nAlso, separating it into two (independent) properties made the\nwriteup much simpler (especially when I needed to add a 5'th\nalternative to DAV:auto-version).\n\n   This seems like an unnecessary jump in complexity, if all that was\n   needed was one more setting for DAV:auto-version, namely\n   \"always-checkout-manual-checkin\".\n\nThe comparison here is 5 possible independent values for the\nauto-version property, versus 2 (symmetric) independent values for the\nauto-checkout and auto-checkin properties.\n\n   (Incidentally, if we go back to the DAV:auto-version property, I\n   recommend renaming \"DAV:when-locked-checkout\" to\n   \"DAV:when-locked-checkout-when-unlocked-checkin\", in order to be\n   consistent with the other setting names.  It should cover both\n   checkout and checkin explicitly like the other setting names.)\n\nThe use of \"unlocked\" here could potentially be confused with \"when\nthe resource is in the unlocked state\" and \"when an UNLOCK operation\nis applied to the resource\" ... but if we don't go back to the\nauto-version property, we don't need to deal with these 6 word\n\"values\" (which is one of the things I felt made the auto-version\nappear unnecessarily complex).  With the auto-checkout and\nauto-checkin properties, simple two word values were sufficient.\n\n   Specific issues with the tuple proposal:\n\n   1. It's not clear to me how the server should behave for some of\n   the settings for (DAV:auto-checkout, DAV:auto-checkin), such as\n   (DAV:unlocked-update, DAV:locked-update) or (not set,\n   DAV:locked-update and/or DAV:unlocked-update).\n\nThe behavior of the server with one value is set is independent of its\nbehavior when another value is set (which is why there is no\ncombinatorics here).\n\nIn particular, auto-checkout=unlocked-update means that when you\nupdate an unlocked (checked-in, version-controlled) resource, it is\nautomatically checked out before the update.  The value of\nauto-checkin has no effect on this behavior.\n\nAnalagously, auto-checkin=locked-update says that when you update a\nlocked (checked-in, version-controlled) resource, it is automatically\nchecked in if it was automatically checked out for the update.  This\nbehavior is independent of the value of auto-checkout.  Now it is true\nthat if auto-checkout=locked-update is not set, then a locked resource\nwould never have been automatically checked out, but this doesn't\nchange/affect the meaning of auto-checkin=locked-update.\n\n   2. What is the meaning of the DAV:unlock setting for\n   DAV:auto-checkin?  It was listed in the formal definition but never\n   referenced in the text.\n\nOops.  That was a remnant of a rejected earlier approach (which didn't\nmake it into the working draft, but did get left in the mail message).\nThere are only 2 possible values for DAV:auto-checkin (i.e.\nDAV:locked-update and DAV:unlocked-update).\n\n   3. The description of the checkin-on-unlock operation doesn't seem\n      complete.\n\n   Geoff Clemm wrote:\n   > If a write-locked version-controlled resource was automatically\n   > checked out because the DAV:auto-checkout property was\n   > DAV:locked-update, a removal of the write lock (such as from an\n   > UNLOCK or lock timeout) is automatically preceded by a checkin\n   > operation.\n\n   Another clause concerning the setting of DAV:auto-checkin seems\n   necessary to make the above statement true:\n\n   \"If a write-locked version-controlled resource was automatically\n   checked out because the DAV:auto-checkout property was\n   DAV:locked-update, and the DAV:auto-checkin property is\n   DAV:unlocked-update and not DAV:locked-update, a subsequent removal\n   of the write lock (such as from an UNLOCK or lock timeout) is\n   automatically preceded by a checkin operation.\"\n\nGood point!  How about the following phrasing though:\n\nIf a write-locked version-controlled resource was automatically\nchecked out because the DAV:auto-checkout property was\nDAV:locked-update, and if the resource was still checked-out when the\nwrite lock is removed (such as from an UNLOCK or lock timeout), then\nthe removal of the write lock is automatically preceded by a checkin\noperation.\n\n   Again, however, I would prefer extending the simpler\n   \"DAV:autoversion\" property over resolving these issues with the new\n   tuple proposal.\n\nI did try to just extend the DAV:auto-version property with this new\nvalue, but it made the precondition and postcondition texts rather\nincomprehensible, while the DAV:auto-checkout and DAV:auto-checkin\nbased text works reasonably well.\n\nSo if it is just a preference, rather than an objection, I'd like\nto go forward with the auto-checkout/auto-checkin properties\n(but feel free to reraise the objection after you see the result\nin the working draft).\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-16163885"}, {"subject": "RE: The Label header, and other issues raised since draft-1", "content": "\"Jim Whitehead\" <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu> wrote:\n\n> > - Internationalizable display of labels:\n> >\n> > This actually has little to do with the label header, since you don't\n> > use the label header to create labels, but rather use the body of the\n> > LABEL method.

That was my underlying concern\nabout the two-property approach:  there are combinations of settings for\nauto-checkout and auto-checkin that produce odd results, or are just\ndysfunctional (as in the above example).  So in that sense, the use of these\ntwo properties is not as well-defined as auto-version was.\n\nI'll leave it up to the list as to whether this is a problem.  It can\ncertainly be avoided by using only combinations that match the old settings\nfor auto-version.  My take on the mapping:\n\nnever:\n    auto-checkout = not set\n    auto-checkin  = not set\n\nalways-checkout-always-checkin:\n    auto-checkout = locked-update, unlocked-update\n    auto-checkin  = locked-update, unlocked-update\n\nalways-checkout-when-unlocked-checkin:\n    auto-checkout = locked-update, unlocked-update\n    auto-checkin  = unlocked-update\n\nwhen-locked-checkout:\n    auto-checkout = locked-update\n    auto-checkin  = unlocked-update\n\nalways-checkout-manual-checkin:\n    auto-checkout = locked-update, unlocked-update\n    auto-checkin  = not set\n\n>    3.

Is\n> there some precedent?\n\nI seem to recall that moddav does not change the last modified timestamp\nwhen properties are updated.\n\nThere has been discussion on this topic previously, with a weak consensus\nthat the properties should not contribute to last modified changes.  I\nthink this is the right answer.\n\nPeter Raymond <Peter.Raymond@merant.com> wrote:\n\n> One example of why we keep the \"last modified\" date separate\n> is that our build system uses this to compare with timestamps\n> of files on disk to decide if the file is out of date.

On the one hand, properties appear\nto be 'part of' a resource.  They appear when a resource is created, and\ndisappear when a resource is deleted.  Operations on a property are via the\nURL of the resource.  However, live properties exhibit behaviour that sets\nthem apart from the resource.  They can change even when a resource is\nversioned or locked, and (at least in a couple of implementations) changes\nto the resource's properties do not change the last modified timestamp of\nthe resource.\n\nLisa Dusseault wrote:\n\n> DeltaV people: What does it mean to get the time file content\n> was last \"modified\", if the file is versioned?  I don't see\n> that the behaviour of getlastmodified is specified for a\n> Version-Controlled Resource, can this be a recommendation in\n> the spec to promote consistency?  For one thing, should\n> 'getlastmodified' on the VCR change when it is checked out,\n> or when it is checked in, or both?\n\nWhen a version-controlled resource is checked-out its contents and dead\nproperties are updated to be the same as the version identified in the\nDAV:checked-in property.  Therefore the DAV:getlastmodified timestamp\nclearly should be updated to reflect the changes.  Note that the timestamp\nvalue is the server's notion of the time the version-controlled resource\nwas modified and not the same as the checked-in version's\nDAV:getlastmodified.\n\nWhen a version-controlled resource is checked-in, its content and dead\nproperties become those of a new version in the version history.

On the one hand, properties appear\nto be 'part of' a resource.  They appear when a resource is created, and\ndisappear when a resource is deleted.  Operations on a property are via the\nURL of the resource.  However, live properties exhibit behaviour that sets\nthem apart from the resource.  They can change even when a resource is\nversioned or locked, and (at least in a couple of implementations) changes\nto the resource's properties do not change the last modified timestamp of\nthe resource.\n\nLisa Dusseault wrote:\n\n> DeltaV people: What does it mean to get the time file content\n> was last \"modified\", if the file is versioned?

Therefore the DAV:getlastmodified timestamp\nclearly should be updated to reflect the changes.

Recently however, (in other contexts) people have shifted in favour\nof extensions to <DAV:resourcetype> to convey more 'type' information.\n\nIn support of this shift of opinion, here's my renditioning of how a client\ncurrently determines the resource classification (if, for example, if a\nclient were given a URL in a property with no other information) in a\nversioning world.\n\nTo get an accurate classification the client has to issue a PROPFIND then\nlook at the results as follows (hopefully my layout is not too cryptic):\n\n>>REQUEST\n     PROPFIND /foo HTTP/1.1\n     Host: bar.com\n     Content-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n     Content-Length: xxx\n\n     <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n     <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n         <D:prop>\n             <D:resourcetype/>\n             <D:auto-checkout/>\n             <D:checked-in/>\n             <D:checked-out/>\n             <D:version-name/>\n             <D:workspace-checkout-set/>\n             <D:baseline-controlled-collection/>\n             <D:subactivity-set/>\n         </D:prop>\n     </D:propfind>\n\nInterpreting the results\n--------------\nKey: The major classifications are listed below from (1) to (8).\n\nEach entry marked with a plus-sign can exist in a checked-in xor\nchecked-out state.\n+\n <DAV:checked-in> defined -- the resource is checked-in.\n <DAV:checked-out> defined -- the resource is checked-out.\n\nEach entry marked with an astrix can exist as a collection resource xor a\nnon-collection resource.\n*\n <DAV:resourcetype> value is not <DAV:collection/> -- the resource is not a\ncollection.\n <DAV:resourcetype> value is <DAV:collection/> -- the resource is a\ncollection.\n\n\n(1+*) Version-controlled resource.\n     <DAV:auto-checkout> defined\n\n(2*) Version.\n     <DAV:version-name> defined\n\n(3) Version history.\n     <DAV:resourcetype> value is <DAV:version-history/>\n\n(4) Workspace.\n     <DAV:resourcetype> value is <DAV:collection/>\n     <DAV:workspace-checkout-set> defined\n\n(5*) Working resource.\n     <DAV:checked-out> defined\n     <DAV:auto-checkout> *not* defined\n\n(6+) Version-controlled configuration.\n     <DAV:baseline-controlled-collection/> defined\n\n(7) Baseline.\n     <DAV:resourcetype> value is <DAV:baseline/>\n\n(8) Activity.\n     <DAV:subactivity-set> defined.\n\n\nObservations\n----------\n(i) For the most part we only care if a property is defined - i.e., it\nexists, and not what it's value is.

(C.E.O)\n\nWe are sending this letter to you based on information gathered from the foreign trade office of the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and industry. We believe that you would be in a position to help us in our bid to transfer the sum of forty-0ne million, five hundred thousand dollars ($41.5m USD) into a foreign account. We are members of the special committee for budget and planning of the Ministry of Petroleum, this committee is principally concerned with contract appraisals and approval of contracts in order of priorities as regards capital project of the federal government of Nigeria. With our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of forty-one million, five hundred thousand united state dollars (us$41.5M). \nThe present government in my country are seeking re-election for that they want the support of foreign government so they have given directive to all federal parastatals to settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract that they has done, so our plan is to include the name that you will provide as one of the contractors being owed in my corporation. What we need from you is to provide a safe account into which the funds will be transferred since government officials are not allowed by our laws to operate foreign account. It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with US$8.3 Million of the remitted funds; we keep US$31.125Million while US$2.075Million will be set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes. \nIt may interest you to know that two years ago a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice miller, the president of crane international trading corporation at number 135, east 57th street, 28th floor, New York 10022 with telephone (212) 308-7788 and telex number 6731689,after the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 25% the money was duly transferred into his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York as we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was no longer on that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to somebody else, that is how we lost US$27.5M to Mr. Patrice Miller. This time around we need a more reliable and trustworthy person or a reputable company to do business with hence this letter to you, so if you can prove yourself to be trusted and interested in this deal then we are prepared to do business with you. \nWhat we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share when this amount of US$41.5M is transferred into your account. If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me through e-mail stated above so we can advice you on the modalities of the transaction. All modalities of the transfer have been worked out and once started will not take more than 7 working days with the absolute support of all concerned. This transaction is 100% safe now and after the transfer. Please treat as urgent and very confidential. God be with you as I look forward to your reply. \n\nBest regards. \nDr. Osuya Joseph. \nRELPY ME WITH THIS EMAIL ADDRESS (osuya2000@fastermail.com )\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-2373253"}, {"subject": "Premium Cigaretts - One Dollar Per Pack", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-2383035"}, {"subject": "FROM VIVIAN", "content": "ATTN:THE MANAGING DIRECTOR.\n\nI am Mrs vivian chinamasa , a widow and national of\nzimbabwe .

As you\nare\nprobably aware, Liberia, a West African Territory was\nembroiled in a protracted civil war for many years.\nThis\nwar of attrition eventually attracted World attention\nbecause of the suffering of both the many warring\nparties\nwhich constantly changed alliances and allegiances,\nand the\ninnocent civilian refugees. There were allegations of\nmuch\natrocities committed and human rights abuses.\n\nNigeria, under the leadership of General Ibrahim\nBadamosi\nBabangida (retired Head of State of Nigeria), appealed\nto\nthe United Nations for help. The later encouraged\nNigeria\nto mediate between \nthe many protagonists. Nigeria subsequently put\ntogether\nthe coalition of 13 member Economic Community of West\nAfrican States, and the regional PEACE KEEPING FORCE\nKNOWN\nAS ECOMOG was born! I was privileged to be the first\ninaugural commander of the Peace keeping force, and I\nimmediately moved into the camp site at the outskirts\nof\nMonrovia, the capital city of Liberia to take my\ncommand.\n\nThe peace keeping exercise was a total success , and\neventually the rebel Samuel Doe was captured and the\nmany\nlesser war lords contained. Eventually Mr. Charles\nTaylor,\nwhose faction was recognized by ECOWAS was helped to\nestablish an acceptable Government; peace was\nrestored; and\nthe rest is history.\n\nDuring the final onslaught which resulted in the\ncapture of\nSamuel Doe, the campaign was meticulously planned and\nexecuted flawlessly; Samuel Doe?s Headquarters was\nseized\nby my men, and much ammunition as usual were\nrecovered;\nHowever, 2 large t runk boxes were also \nrecovered and I immediately ordered them taken to my\nquarters because there were rampant cases of pilfering\nand\noutright looting by the Soldiers (the Soldiers came\nfrom\ndifferent Countries and sometimes discipline was\nhard).\n\nWhen I examined the Trunk boxes, I got a shock! They\nwere\nstacked full of 100 Dollar bills! To my inexperienced\neye,\nI estimated that the boxes must contain at least 20\nMillion\nDollars! I was faced with an instant dilemma?I dared\nnot\ndeclare this discovery to the Military High command;\nthe\nmoney would promptly disappear into private pockets of\nthe\nMilitary high brass. I immediately swore my ADC to\nsecrecy and decided to transport the boxes into\nNigeria. I\nused my powers to requisition a Hercules Transport\nAirPlane\nunder my Command and airlifted the boxes to Nigeria.\nNeedless to say, Our Aircrafts and military\nequipment/property do not undergo Customs checks.\n\nAcco rdingly I immediately took the trunk boxes and\ndeposited them in a safe deposit box belonging to Mega\nSecurity Company Ltd. Of course No one knows the\ncontent\nof these boxes and I simply listed ?VALUABLES? in the\ndeposit form and I paid the token charge of 2,500.00\nUSD\nper annum. The date was 15th January, 1991.\n\nI deliberately waited for the right political climate\nto\nmove this money abroad for investment purposes. The\ntime is\nnow right because a properly elected Civilian\nGovernment is\nnow in charge of Nigeria. \n\nI need your help because I am a highly visible\npersonality,\nand any attempt by me to transfer this money to a\nforeign\nCountry will fail. Also the law in Nigeria does not\nallow\nserving or retired Military Personnel to own/operate\nforeign Bank Accounts in their name?I have therefore\narranged out a perfect and 100% risk free method of\ntransferring this money abroad, with your help. \n\nIf you are interested in helping me, please reply\nimmediately, giving me your phone and fax numbers and\nI\nwill give you further details ; we will then establish\na\ngame plan to achieve our aim. Please bear in mind that\nas\nfar as you are concerned, this transaction IS NOT\nILLEGAL\nand and that for your assistance, 30% of the fund will\nbe\nyours. This is the word of a military officer. \n\nThank you,\n\nGen. . Akulunor Ben Rtd.\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________________________\nToo much spam in your inbox? Yahoo!

Before his death we were both born again\nChristians.Since his\ndeath I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my\nmatrimonial\nhome which the Bible is against.When my late husband was\nalive he\ndeposited the sum of $12 Million (Twelve Million U.S.\nDollars) with a\nSecurity and Finance Company in Europe.\n\nPresently, this money is still under the safe keeping of\nthe Security\nand Finance Company in Nigeria,which they have office in\nEurope where\nyou can claim this fund.

According to Laws of Republic of China,\nat the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the\nownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Smith Lawrence so that the fruits of\nthis old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\ngovernment officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\nimmediately your full names and address so that the attorney will\nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in\nplace as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney\nfor drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary\ndocuments and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the\ntransfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide\nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\nbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for\nus to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you.\n\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will\nbe done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees\nthe successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,\nplease reply immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your\nresponse, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant\ndocuments that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me\nyour confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. \n\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.

I am MR.ANDR? LA GRANGE, the chief executive officer of one of the topmost banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank, Late ANDREAS SCHRANNER, a citizen of Munich, Germany who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard. There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Until his death he was the manager,SCHRANNER GOLD[pty]SA. No other person knows about this account or anything concerning it and the account has no other beneficiary.\n\nThe fund in question amounts to TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS[$26 Million]. Since I discovered this fund,I have personally and quitely made several,deep and extensive enquiries to find out every thing about the late great industrialist,MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER . The summary of my investigation shows that late ANDREAS SCHRANNER who is a citizen of Germany has no surviving relation. I came across your name and contact on the course of my personal searching for the late ANDREAS SCHRANNER's relations,so I decided to contact you for this project.\n\nI am contacting you to assist me in repatriating and securing the wealth left behind in a fixed deposit account by late ANDREAS SCHRANNER , before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my bank. The board of my bank, has issued a notice that after 2 months from now and no next of kin shown up for the claim, the funds will be confiscated and declared unserviceable. Since late ANDREAS SCHRANNER died without a HEIR/WILL,I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the proceed of this deposit valued at twenty six million United States dollars($26 Million Dollars) can be released to you.\n\nThe bank will release the funds to any foreigner who has all related information / documents to the bank account which I am going to provide to you on your positive response. Everything is under my control.\n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. \n\nThe banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. \n\nI shall provide you all the information and copy of the certificate of deposit issued to late ANDREAS SCHRANNER when he deposited the fund. I shall also involve a confidential attorney who is a government acredited attorney to the bank who shall represent you in all the appropriate offices for the claim. I also have all necessary information we need for the claim and once the money is transferred to you, I shall destroy all the documents used for the claim and leave no traces. AFTER EVERYTHING, YOU SHALL HAVE 35% OF THE TOTAL SUM, 65% FOR ME, WHILE 5% WILL BE FOR EXPENSES BOTH OF US MUST HAVE INCURED DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERING THIS FUND.\n\nWe will start the first transfer with $6 Million. Upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we will go ahead to transfer the balance of $20 Million to the same account and we share. All I require from you is your honest/humble  cooperation to enable us see this business successful. I guarantee you that this business will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Late ANDREAS SCHRANNER was a very good man and it is not wise to allow his hard earned wealth to go in vain. \n\nFurther details awaits your response by my private\nemail: andregrange@workmail.co.za\n\nPLEASE,TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.\n\nBest Regards\n\nMR.GRANGE\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!

This contract has been executed and full payments have been made to the contractors who executed these contract leaving behind us$35million as an over-invoice amount for we the committee members on a mutual understanding. \nIn view of this, my colleague has mandated me to look for a foreign partner abroad who will receive the money on our behalf since as civil servants with restrictions on financial matters, we can not put up claims for the money in our names, neither are we alloowed to own or operate foreign accounts. Which means that you will provide us with any account of your choice where we can lodge this fund immediately. I will be visiting your country upon your confirmation of recieving the fund in your nominated account, to know you better and discuss viable investment ideas such as importation of goods back to our country since it will be unwise to return with such huge cash. \nDISBURSEMENT OF THE FUND IS AS FOLLOWS: 25% of the total sum will be your share asaccoumt provider and the one to be fronted and register here as the bonafide beneficiary of the fund towards seeking the necessary approvals that would enable its remittance to the account you nominate. 70% will be for me and my colleague . 5% will be an outstanding amount to settle any incurred expenses during the transfer. WE ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE AND VERY LEGITIMATE AS ALL MODALITIES HAVE BEEN PERFECTED BY US WITH OUR CONNECTION IN GOVERNMENT.

I was the account officer to one Mr. Butch.R.Miguel who died along with his family on the 8th of November 1999 in an ADC Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared dead.  He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of $15.5million FiFteen million five hundred thousand USA Dollars. Since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money. Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim. The banking and financial law of Merith Intl.Bank stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of four (4) it will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\n\n On this discovery, I and two other senior staffs now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin to Butch.R.Miguel for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement. The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer Mr. Butch.R.Miguel was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that 30% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account,you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,indicating your bank account number \nand location where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest,I will send to you the text of the application that you will send to the Merith Intl.Bank authority for an approval to submit your claims. Send your reply through my direct and private email address.(info_godferyaccount@mytolmail.com)indicates your direct Fax and telephone number for effective communication that this transaction needs.

According to my father, \nthis money was the income accrued from mining co-operation over draft and \nminor sales. Before the peace of the civil war between the rebel forces of \nMajor Paul Korormah and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping \noperation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal \nfrom power of the civilian elected president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the \nrebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother, my \nlittle sister and myself to be evacuated to spain,  with our persona effort \nand the box containing the money. My father deposited the box in a private \nsecurity company here in spain for the safe custody until after the war when \nhe will join us. During the war in my country, and following the!  \nindiscriminate looking of the public and government properties by the rebels \nforces, the Sierra-Leone  mining coop. was one of the targets looted and \ndestroyed. My father including other top government functionaries were \nattacked and killed by the rebels  because of the relationship with the \ncivilian president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.\nAs a result of my father's death, our hope of survival. The untimly deaths \ncaused mother heart failure and other releated complications of which she \nlater died in hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her. Now, \nmy 17 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country \nsuffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like \nrefugees and orphans. Our only hope now is in you and the box deposited in a \nSecurity Company.\nTo this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the following ways. To \nassist me claim this box from Security Company as co-benficiary. To transfer \nthis money in your name to your country To make good arranagement for a \njoint business investment on our behalf in your country and you, the \ncareteker.

Ich hoffe sehr, dass diese Mails den Ansto? geben werden, Ihr Leben nachhaltig und zum Positiven hin zu ver?ndern. Denn mit diesem ersten Schritt er?ffnen Sie sich selbst neue M?glichkeiten. Sie k?nnen und werden sich bequem und von zu Hause aus, einen ?ppigen Nebenverdienst aufbauen ? wenn Sie etwas mehr Zeit investieren wollen, nat?rlich auch ein umfangreiches Haupteinkommen. \n\nFolgen Sie den Anweisungen, die Sie von uns in den n?chsten Wochen erhalten, bleiben Sie dran, arbeiten Sie t?glich eine, am besten mehrere Stunden nach unseren Anweisungen und der Erfolg ist Ihnen sicher. Sie k?nnen mit Multi-Level-Marketing im Internet mehrere 1000  Euro im Monat verdienen. Es ist m?glich und es ist nicht einmal besonders schwer. Sie brauchen nur die richtigen Informationen und Ausdauer. Die Informationen werden Sie von uns bekommen, die Ausdauer kann nur von Ihnen selbst kommen. Andere k?nnen es auch und es gibt keinen Grund, warum Sie deren Erfolg nicht wiederholen k?nnen. \n\nWarum ist das so? Ganz einfach. In dieser Mailserie steht genau, was ich machte und mache, um im Internet mit Multi-Level-Marketing erfolgreich zu sein. Im Internet sind alle gleich. Jeder hat die gleichen Chancen und M?glichkeiten. Das hei?t, wenn Sie meinem Weg folgen, werden Sie genauso erfolgreich werden. Denn was wir Ihnen vorstellten in unserer ersten Mail ist keiner dieser Kettenbriefe, wo Sie ?nur? ein paar Millionen Leute in der Downline brauchen und schon sind Sie stinkreich, es ist auch kein Gesch?ft, bei dem Sie gezwungen werden, f?r teures Geld Waren einzukaufen in der Hoffnung, sie dann wieder verkaufen zu k?nnen. Sie werden Geld verdienen, indem Sie eine solide Firma mit einem der besten Verbrauchsprodukte weiterempfehlen und Sie werden lernen, Ihr Gesch?ft immer wieder zu multiplizieren. \n\nMir ist bewusst, dass es nicht einfach ist, das zu glauben. Aber im Grunde ist es gar nicht so schwer im Internet erfolgreich zu sein! Denn MLM basiert darauf, dass Sie f?r Unternehmen die Werbung ?bernehmen ? statt teurer Agenturen. Und es gibt zahlreiche Werbem?glichkeiten, mit deren Hilfe Sie neue Vertriebspartner werben werden. Und es gibt diese Mailserie, mit der die von Ihnen geworbenen Partner selbst erfolgreich werden und Sie damit ebenfalls noch erfolgreicher machen. \n\nZun?chst m?chten wir Sie aber mit einigen allgemeinen Informationen zum Thema MLM auf das Kommende einstimmen. \n\nWas ist MLM eigentlich? \nMulti-Level-Marketing ist etwas, was jeder machen kann, egal aus welcher Einkommens oder Bildungsschicht er kommt - aber nicht jeder macht etwas draus! Noch nie hatten der einfache Mann, die Hausfrau mit Kind, der gut verdienende, aber ?berarbeitete Manager eine solche Chance. Erfolg kommt durch Ausdauer, Durchstehen von Durststrecken, immer wieder von vorne beginnen. Sie werden sehen: Sobald Sie Ihre Chance erkannt haben, boomt Ihre Organisation!\nK?mmern Sie sich nicht um die ewigen Meckerer sondern um diejenigen, bei denen Sie sp?ren, dass Sie in diesem Gesch?ft erfolgreich sein wollen und die auch bereit sind, daf?r etwas zu tun.\n\nWenn Network Marketing so toll ist, warum macht`s nicht jeder?\nWenn ?rzte und Anw?lte gut verdienen, warum sind nicht 50 Millionen in diesen Berufen? Ein Wort: Unverst?ndnis. Die Bev?lkerungsmehrheit versteht Network Marketing nicht und sieht das Potential nicht. Zu wenige haben sich bisher ernsthaft und qualifiziert damit auseinandergesetzt. Zudem hat eben jeder verschiedene Interessen, seien es Vorabendserien, Stammtisch. die Bundesliga oder eine Gesch?ftsgelegenheit zur Erreichung einer finanziellen Absicherung und/oder Pers?nlichkeitsentwicklung. Keiner muss, jeder kann.\n\nIch hab`s versucht, Network Marketing klappt nicht bei mir.\nWillkommen im Club. Auf wie viel Versuche waren Sie beim Laufen lernen durch Ihre Eltern limitiert? Zwei Versuche? Drei oder vier hatten Ihnen Ihre Eltern sicher zugestanden, oder? Sicher waren die Versuche nicht limitiert, sonst w?rden Sie heute noch krabbeln!\nAufgeber gewinnen nie!!! Hatten Sie aufgegeben, weil es nicht ?ber Nacht zum Traumauto gereicht hatte? Manchmal klappt es eben nicht sofort. Nach 20 ,,Nein\" wird es nicht einfacher. Versuchen Sie doch absichtlich 20 ,,qualifizierte\" Nein zu erhalten. Sie werden scheitern, denn irgendwer sagt bestimmt ,,Ja\". Network Marketing funktioniert, Sie \"funktionieren\" vermutlich nicht richtig. F?r jeden Einzelhandelskaufmann oder Handwerker sind Ausbildungszeiten vorgesehen. Da wollen Sie ein vom Himmel gefallener Networker sein? Das konnte nicht funktionieren, Sie waren vermutlich nicht bereit, hatten keine Erfahrung, einen schlechten Sponsor und ein schlechtes Networkunternehmen. Aber Network Marketing funktioniert. Sie brauchen nur eine gute Network Marketing Firma im Hintergrund.\n\nNur wenige sind erfolgreich im Network Marketing\nUngl?cklicherweise gibt es bei jedem Handwerk die wenigen ,,Erfolgreichen\". Die meisten Menschen machen einfach nicht die richtigen Schritte. Network Marketing bildet hier keine Ausnahme. Viele Menschen wollen auf der Strasse des Erfolgs wandeln und steigen deshalb in ein MLM ein. Doch es ist kein Paradies. Network Marketing ist das Synonym f?r Arbeit! Es braucht Zeit und Ausdauer, Beharrlichkeit und brennendes Verlangen. Viele falsche Vorstellungen werden beim Anwerben geweckt und k?nnen nicht erf?llt werden. Klar, man h?rt die kleine Erfolgsstory von der netten Hausfrau und dem Hilfsarbeiter. Viele Leute scheitern an einem Wort: ARBEIT! Und dieses Wort gef?llt nicht, ganz klar. Leute wollen alles umsonst und verlieren das Interesse, wenn es nicht sofort klappt. Den klassischen Ausspruch kennt man: \" Ich habe es eine ganze Woche versucht und es hat nicht funktioniert, das ist alles Schwindel!\" Dies ist nicht nur im Network Marketing so, so ist es in allen Lebenslagen.\n\nSchauen Sie sich Ihre Arbeitsstelle an. Sie arbeiten 40 Stunden in der Woche 40 Jahre lang. Alles was Sie daf?r bekommen ist eine goldene Uhr, ein Zinnteller und ein feuchter H?ndedruck vom Chef. Das war`s! Fast - ?ne kleine Rente wird's mit viel Gl?ck noch geben. Viele sind doch mit 65 entweder schon gestorben oder einfach kaputt. \nDas fatale an MLM ist die Tatsache, dass es \"viel zu einfach\" zu beginnen ist, \"noch viel einfacher\" ist der Ausstieg. Wenn Sie z.B. eine Zahnarztpraxis er?ffnen, m?ssen Sie Unsummen investieren. Da wird das Aufgeben schwierig.\n\nNetwork Marketing ist ein richtiger Beruf und sollte als solcher auch angesehen werden. Finden Sie Ihre Berufung!\n\nNun sollten Sie sich mit den Luckyback Produkten und der Philosophie etwas n?her besch?ftigen!

I am the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard.\n\nThere is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a\nwritten or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I personally has watched with keen interest\nto see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person\nknows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his\ndeath he was the manager of his company.\n\nThe total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[One Hundred and Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any\ndisappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.\n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to\nhave a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to\nnominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.\n\nThe banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. \n\nIn view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in\nhis or her personal account. At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give\nyou 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining\n5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.\n\nUpon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not\nfail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you\napply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.\n\nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me. You should also include\nyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.\n\nTel: 874-763648313\n   : 874-763648314\nFax: 874-763648315\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMr,VINCENT  UZUORJI.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3327893"}, {"subject": "Ultimate CD Library - 10,000 Books with a Bonu", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3337210"}, {"subject": "???????? ????!!??????.??????.????????.1?????????? ???? ????!!  xzsxtvhnwqqqra a", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3343908"}, {"subject": "footfal", "content": "premature oracular fictitious beatnik starfish \nmucosa placeable franciscan cattail stow downfall blather beauteous monsoon \npeppermint malconduct cede cramer anomie councilwomen \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3350851"}, {"subject": "Wai?? ???? ???? 5?? ???? ???? ??????. yc qa", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3358502"}, {"subject": "anthracnos", "content": "wobble activate duplex germanium bromfield roach conspirator tried improbable \neeoc mexican christendom expedient chen revoke tag \ngilt luxury canteen cholesterol atlantes sequel \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3365846"}, {"subject": "preparatory carloa", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3371961"}, {"subject": "Tabela Geral/Componente", "content": "nunoNormalSAFEMODE212004-03-09T16:37:00Z2004-03-09T16:37:00Z1130707.5183610.2625 CleanClean21MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 \n \n\n??

This was\nreported widely by most international media. \n\n\nThis problem started when the Zimbabwean government\nunder the leadership \nof President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May\n31st 2000 to seize more than 849 white and political\nopposition owned farms. During these periods, as\nreported by international media, BBC and the CNN, more\nthan 6 white farmers were killed including my late\nhusband. The government did not stop at this, as just\nrecently the government have asked all white-farmers\nto give up their farms to black farmers and\npoliticians who are in alliance with the ruling party\nor risk going to prison and possibly killed. So far,\nmore than 1,400 white owned farms have been invaded\nand confiscated, as well as claiming the properties of\nthe farmers. Also, about 133 white farmers were\narrested for defying the orders to leave their farms\nunder the controversial land reform programme of the\ngovernment. Having married and lived with my late\nhusband in this country Zimbabwe for more than 32\nyears, I have no other country to go to. Therefore, I\ndecided to contact you, for your assistance, so that I\ncan divert my interest in Zimbabwe to a more stable\ncountry as yours. Before my husband suden death, he\nwas able to planned well ahead of time to secure some\nof our properties which were meant for a new farm in\nBoswana and made a reason money deposit to a finance\ncompany. I will not disclose the name of the finance\ncompany and the amount that was deposited for security\nreasons. \n\n \n\nHowever, I will make it known to you as soon as I\nreceive a response from you through my lawyer who has\nbeen authorized to act on my behalf. The finance\ncompany is not aware of the actual contents of the\nconsignment. All they know is that the two box\nconsignment contain gem stones as reflected in the\ndeposit certificate. Also, I must re-iterate the\nimportance of having a citizen of your country to\nfront for me, since I intend to invest and settle in\nyour country. I do not know much about your country's\nland-ownership laws, I thought it wise to seek the\nhelp of a citizen to act as proxy for me and my\nchildren as their future is right now very bleak. I\nwill upon receiving your consent make all arrangement\nto move the funds to you pending my arrival to meet\nwith you in your country so that we can both make\nfurther arrangements with regards to the investment.\nEvery modality will be worked out by my lawyer to\nensure that the money is conveniently moved to your\nregion to enable you receive it in person without any\nsetbacks or inconveniencies. He will arrange a smooth\nmeeting between you and the finance company for the\ndelivery to you.\n\n \n\nFor your assistance to me, you will be entittled to a\ncommission of 30% of the total sum that you will be\nreceiving on my behalf for the above purpose. If you\nare interested and willing to assist me, you should\nplease forward to my lawyer via his private email\naddress as stated below: \n\n \n\nMR. JOSEPH A. McCATHY.\n\nMcCATHY AND COMPANY.\n\n92, VICTORIA STREET, JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.\n\nE-MAIL:  joe_mccathy@tiscali.co.uk\n\n\nI am waiting urgently for your response, while also\nrequesting that you treat this matter in strict\nprivacy. \n\n \n\nPresently, I am in great danger under security watch\nand will appreciate you correspond with me via my\nlawyer's confidential email address:\n<joe_mccathy@tiscali.co.uk> with the following\ndetails: \n\n \n\n1.

Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25 years old and studying Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in NOVEMBER27th LAST year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has One Hundred and Five Million  United States Dollars   (USD105,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Bank . He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My mothe\n r did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father?s properties, companies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of Go\n d, you will help us move this money out of the {BANK} to your country where we can invest this money judiciously with you.

I am a medical practitioner, Dr. Stephen Eneli. I have a patient I am treating privately because of her status. She is the wife of a prominent politician here in South Africa. She is Mrs. Susan Yengeni and has been ill for a couple of months now. This woman confided in me based on the free medical attention I have been giving to her and revealed to me her life ordeals, which is very touching. Her husband, Mr. Tony Yengeni, was arrested and charged to court for a multibillion dollar arms deal fraud which she said was politically motivated by his enemies as her husband was the chairman of parliament in South Africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political party. \n\nShe also told me that he accented to plead guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges but was later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank accounts in South Africa and abroad being frozen. Now, things are really bad for her husband and children. Based on this, she cannot even afford to take care of her medical expenses. This is why I am rendering her free medical attention. Due to the fact that her husband is still being monitored, she was advised by him to source for a credible and trustworthy partner abroad who will help in managing and investing some funds he secretly deposited in a security firm for safe keeping some years ago. The amount is US$117.5million contained in sealed boxes. \n\nHe deposited these boxes with a safe security company in one of the European countries for safekeeping as family treasures and African artifacts to prevent the officials of the company from raising eyebrow. I wish and believe you will be in a position to assist in managing this large sum for a profitable venture and also to help create a safe heaven for her and her children by making a residential arrangement for them in your country. After she had disclosed this information to me, I saw the reason to request that she allows me see the documents relating to this deposit of which she did. I will oblige you with more information as soon as I receive your response via my personal/confidential email: seneli@5fm.za.com for security reasons. \n\nYou can find more about her husband's predicaments at the following websites: \n\nhttp://www.polity.org.za/html/govdocs/pr/2001/pr1003b.html \nhttp://www.gov.za/projects/procurement/yengeni.htm \nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1577682.stm \nhttp://www.hsf.org.za/focus22/focus22ethics.html \nhttp://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/10/06/stories/0306000k.htm \nhttp://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/articles00/govt_reserves.html \nhttp://www.ifp.org.za/Releases/190303apr.htm \n\nLet me assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. From my discussion with her, she has agreed to give you a reasonable percentage of the money for your assistance, which will be negotiated and agreed on by both sides. I am obliged to assist this lady knowing that she has a limited knowledge in the business world. I will need from you a mutual understanding and then we shall make plans of how the funds would be secured into an account in your name. \n\nThanks and God bless you for your understanding.

I have an\nurgent and very confidential business proposition for\nyou. On December, 1998, a Taiwanese Oil\nconsultant/contractor with the Nigerian National\nPetroleum Corporation, Mr. Boris Chen made a numbered\ntime (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty-Four calendar months,\nvalued at US$16,000,000.00 (Sixteen Million\nDollars) in my branch.\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his\nforwarding address but got no reply. After some\nmonths, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Boris Chen\ndied from an airplane crash ( Singapore Airlines).\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died\nwithout making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his\nnext of kin was fruitless. I therefore\nmade further investigation and discovered that Mr.\nBoris Chen did not declare any kin or relations in all\nhis official documents, including his Bank Deposit\npaperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$16,000,000.00 is\nstill sitting in my Bank and the interest is being\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each\nyear. No one has ever come forward to claim it.\nAccording to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5\n(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership\nof the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim\nthe fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will\nlike you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Boris\nChen so that the fruits of this old man's labour will\nnot get into the hands of some corrupt government\nofficials. This is simple, I will like you to provide\nimmediately your full names and address so that the\nAttorney will prepare the necessary documents\nand affidavits which will put you in place as the next\nof kin. We shall employ the services of two Attorney\nfor drafting and notarization of the WILL and to\nobtain the necessary documents and letter of\nprobate/administration in your favour for the\ntransfer. A bank account in any part of the world\nwhich you will provide will then facilitate the\ntransfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next\nof kin. The money will be paid into your account for\nus to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you\nand 5% be used in settling taxation and all local and\nforeign expenses.There is no risk at all as all\nthe paperwork for this transaction will be done by the\nAttorney and my position as the Branch Manager\nguarantees the successful execution of this\ntransaction.\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via\nthe private email address below. Upon your response, I\nshall then provide you with more details and relevant\ndocuments that will help you understand the\ntransaction.\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest\nassured that this transaction would be most profitable\nfor both of us because I shall require your assistance\nto invest my share in your country.

My husband was recently impeached in office by an opposition group backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators\nand Senate Traitors. \n\nMost of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts. You will agree\nwith me that this is political and the only way they can remain in office while perpetuating Tyranny.\n\nDuring my husband's regime as President of Phillipines, he stashed out the sum of Forty Million United States Dollars from various contract projects. He deposited this money with security companies Twenty-three milliom in Bangkok Thailand and Seventeen Million in Valencia,The\nSpain in my name (Mrs Luisa Estrada). The money has been with the security companies since then and the government does  not know about it.\n\nPresently, life has not been easy for my children and I, my travel documents have been seized by the government. \n \nNow, I want to start a new life with the money my husband deposited with the security company. I also want to invest the money outside Philippines.  Please, I want you to assist me get the money released from the security company immediately as my beneficiary,there is no risk at all about this.\n\nI have discussed with the security company manager about this arrangement and he assured me that they will be willing to release the money to my representative. I would give you the secret pin code number of the money, the telephone and fax numbers of the company. I will give you 30% of the total amount if you assist me to get the\nmoney released.\n\nIf you are willing to assist me, Kindly furnish me with you full names, contact phone and fax numbers, to enable me give the information to the company.\n \nMeanwhile, I would be communicating with you by email because my telephone lines are bugged at the moment. The email is my only means of communication. \n\nI hope to travel out of Philippines as soon as the money is released to you. I would want us to be in partnership in any good business you may suggest in your country. \n\nPlease handle this transaction with maturity and\nsincerity.  \n\nBest Regards,\n\nMrs Luisa Estrada.\nEmail: luisaexestrada@netscape.net\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3897898"}, {"subject": "FROM  MRS  JULIANA  MAKEL", "content": "DEAR Friend ,\n\n\n Please don't be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do not know each other before now. I am MRS. JULIANA MBULUKU MAKELE, the wife of late TATE MAKELE , a farmer in ZIMBABWE who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you.\n\n Before the death of my husband, he made a deposit with a security Firm. The consignment was declared to contain GEM STONES shipped on diplomatic cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents. The actual content is the sum of US25.5 million (twenty Five Million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars only). This was done when he noticed the looming danger in Zimbabwe on land policies.The security company does not know the actual contents of the one-box out of the three trunk boxes/ consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons.\n\n This mount was meant for the purchase of new Agricultural machineries and chemicals for our Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers alike. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society during political electioins in my country.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only \nfocused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know \nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. \nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way \nfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property \nand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. \nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity \norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed \nmoney to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has \ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one \nof my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and \nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as \nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left \nfor them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars \n$18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.\nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time.\n\nGod be with you. \n\nBATES ALAN\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3916918"}, {"subject": "???????? ?????? ??????.??????.????????.1?????????? ???? ????!!   ststh  lvu", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3925053"}, {"subject": "Visit Croatian Adriatic for your summer vacatio", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3932049"}, {"subject": "????????????????????1?? ???? ?????? ?????? ???? ???? ???? ??????????!! ff ss jlz", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3938856"}, {"subject": "(????)???????????????? ?????? ?? ???? ????????!????????!&#64; hooyjf", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3946053"}, {"subject": "look rich now get rich later fake rolex watche", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3953166"}, {"subject": "(????) ?????? ?????? ???? ??????!! ???? ?????? ????????.~ ^^&#64; 609709114", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3961286"}, {"subject": "[ietf-charsets] &lt;none&gt", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-3968360"}, {"subject": "WINNING   NOTIFICATIO", "content": " \n                         EL GORDO DE LA PRIMITIVA       \n\n                                         C/GUZMAN EL BUENO,137\n                                           MADRID - ESPAA \n            ;                             \n                               E-mail: elgordoprimi2004@netscape.net\n\nFROM: THE DESK OF THE PROMOTIONS MANAGER, \nINTERNATIONAL PROMOTIONS/PRIZE AWARD DEPARTMENT, \nREF: LP/26510460037/04\nBATCH: 24/00319/IPD\n\nRE: AWARD NOTIFICATION FINAL NOTICE \n\nWe are pleased to inform you of the release today, 27th of MARCH 2004, of the ELGORDO SWEEPSTAKE LOTTERY/INTER-NATIONAL PROGRAMS held on the 21st of MARCH 2004. \nYour  name attached to ticket number 025 11464992-750 with serial number 2113-05 drew the lucky number 3-18-19-30-32-39, which consequently won the lottery in the 3rd category. \n\nYou are therefore been approve for the lump sum pay out of euros 1,547,000.87 (One Million Five Hundred And Fourty Seven Thousand  euros Eighty  Seven cents.) in cash credit to the file REF: LP/26510460037/04.

I am Zulu Danjuma, the first and only surviving son of late Marc Masuku Danjuma one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa, to deposit the sum of US$15 million (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country , to the Netherlands where i am currently seeking asylum.\n\nI have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.\n\nThere are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 30% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone & fax numbers. \n\nI await your reply through thiscontact e-mail address, == magamazulu@excite.com while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.\n\nI shall furnish you with more details on request.\n\nPLEASE KINDLY REPLY ME THROUGH MY E MAIL ADDRESS WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS FOR SECURITY PURPOSE==\nREPLY TO = magamazulu@excite.com\n \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4250906"}, {"subject": "advice m", "content": "dear sir/ madame,\n\n\ni had known that you won the prize of LOTERIA Y APUESTAS DEL ESTADOS , and i \nwant to know how you got the money , what are the procedures and cost for \nthat, please e-mail me the details , did you already got the money uptill \nthis moment.\n\nthanks & best regards\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE* \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4259752"}, {"subject": "?????? ???????????????? 3?????????? ????????

(SRGE) is a cutting-edge leader \nthat designs, develops, manufactures, and markets superior \npatented outside plant electrical surge protection \nequipment for the telecommunications industry.\nThe US sales projections for this market are $4 Billion \nannually, with this figure growing rapidly as the \nexpansion of new HDSL and ADSL technologies permeate \nthe industry.\n\nSRGE provides the Telecom industry with the highest \nquality \"protection element\" for complex digital switches. \nProtecting these Telecom switching devices is crucial to \ninclusive components that are sensitive to interruptions \nin voltage which can cause extensive network damage, thus \nnegating costly and time-consuming repair and down-time.\nMajor Telecoms require this protection throughout their \nnetwork in order to prevent the hazards of harming \npersonnel, damaging expensive equipment, and massive \nsystem failures.\n\nOpening Price: 1.15\n10 Day Target: 2.30\n1 Month Target: 4.50\nOutstanding Shares: 16.5 million\nEst.

It was borne out of my\ndesire to share a mutual business relation ship with\nyou.\n\nMy name is Mr. cole hans,a Secretary,a Ghana\nnational married with four children. I work as an\nadministrative Secretary to Diplomatic Courier\nSecurities and Finance company,in Accra-Ghana.\n\nI decided to contact you believing that by the grace\nof God, you will accept to be my patner in this\nbusiness. I earn a salary of ?1.4M -200 USD equivalent\nmonthly. I joined the services of this company in 1991\nas an office assistant. I decided\nto contact you believing that by the grace of God the\nyou will accept to be my partner in this business.\n\nI have been working with this company for nine years.\nWithin this period, I have watched with meticulous\nprecision how African Heads of States and government\nfunctionaries have been using Diplomatic Courier\nSecurities and Finance to move huge sums of money USD,\nPound sterling, French France - (Cash) to their\nforeign partners.\n\nThey bring in these consignments of money cash and\nsecretly declare the contents as jewelleries, gold,\ndiamond, precious stones, family treasure, documents\netc. Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria (dead), Mobutu Sese\nSeko of Zaire (dead) Foday Sankoy of Siera - Leone,\nBabangida of Nigeria etc. All these people have\nhundreds of consignments deposited with Diplomatic\nCourier Securities and Finance. Their foreign\npartners, friends and relatives, are claiming most of\nthese consignments. A lot of them are lying here\nunclaimed for as much as 15 yrs. No body may ever come\nfor them because in most cases, the documents of\ndeposit are never available to any body except the\ndepositors most of them dead.\n\nSince the inception of the 2000 millennium, Diplomatic\nCourier Securities and Finance changed the procedure\nof claims of consignments. As soon as you are able to\nproduce all the secret information as contained in the\nsecret file of any consignment, it will be released to\nyou upon demand. From our record, more than 120\nconsignments belonging to Gen Abacha / Mobutu Sese\nSeko, has been claimed in the past six months. This is\nwhy I am soliciting for your co-operation and\nassistance. Gen. Abacha has 85 consignments deposited\nwith several names and codes. 35 have been claimed in\nthe past six months.\n\nI have finished every arrangement for you to come and\nclaim consignment No 1201 containing USD 7.5M and\nconsignment No 1200 contain USD 1.5M. My duty is to\nsupply you with all the information and documents\nby fax. You will deal directly with the management.\n\nThe procedure is simple:You will apply officially to\nthe Director of Operations of Diplomatic Courier Securities and Finance\nfor the elease of consignmentNo 1200 and No 1201. They will demand some\ndocuments and secret codes. Call me, I?ll supply you with every detailed\ninformation.Fax it to them.As soon as they confirm it to be correct. They\nwill invite you forthe\ncollection.\n\nIf you do not want to come to Accra, you can arrange\nwith them to transfer the consignment to any where on agreement.No body\nwill ever know I am involved in the deal except the Lawyer who will write an\nagreement for us.I?ll suggest upon conclusion we share 50 - 50.At the\nsuccesful conclusion of the deal,you?ll arrangefor me and my family to\ncome over to your country. I assure you that the business have been\nhatched for 5 years now,it isvery very secure and risk free.\n\nYou can get back to me on this mail address giving me\nyour secured phone and fax numbers for further\nexplanations and directives\non the procedure.\n\nGod Bless You.\nSincerely Yours,\n\nMr. cole hans\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4504285"}, {"subject": "THANKS", "content": "Dear Friend,\n \n Greetings\"\n\n I am Hajia (Mrs.) Mariam Abacha, wife of late\n Nigerian head of state- Gen. Sanni Abacha. We have\n not met before,I got your contact through Nigerian\n Chamber of Commerce and I felt I should trust you.\n It is no news telling you that my family has been\n going through untold hardship since the 18th June\n 1998 when my husband died.\n \n My family has lost so much including some fixed\n assets my husband acquired while in office.\n Evidently, the pages of all Nigeria dailies, which\n you can equally get from Nigeria embassy in your\n country, will tell better our story. Even now, our\n homes are under surveillance, worst of all, the\n Government has restored to consficating everything\n that has to do with our family.\n \n Before the death of my husband, he ran among other\n business of his own, bureau de change, which was\n flourishing with every Government support. From the\n bureau de change business, which has now been\n clamped down by Nigeria Government, I was able to\n save USD$24,000,000.00 in cash. I tried to safeguard\n it in a security company here in Nigeria but\n couldn??t. Through the help of a close family friend\n who works in a security company, I delivered the\n USD$24 million and moved it out of Nigeria under the\n label of photographic materials to a security\n company in EUROPE.For security reason,I wouldn??t\n mention the name of the country until I hear from\n you.\n \n In view of our condition here and the high interest\n rate the security company charges, the money could\n not be safe there.\n \n I would therefore need your honest assistance to\n move this fund from the Security Company to your\n nominated bank account. Once the money is\n safeguarded in your account, I would require your\n directives to enable me invest same in any viable\n business venture. If you accept this offer, of\n assistance you are requested to contact me via my\n email address as above or my lawyer Barrister Ahmed\n Bako & co. via his e-mail address: barrister \n [ahmedbako_ass100@irangate.net] As soon as he receives\n your acceptance notice, he will furnish you with the\n details which includes; lodging code and clearance\n permit to enable you clear the consignment from the\n Security Company. Note that, You will be accorded \n with 20% of the total sum for your assistance.\n \n Finally, you are requested to indicate your\n telephone and fax numbers to me or my lawyer for\n easier communication.\n \n While thanking you for your anticipated\n co-operation, I look forward to your urgent reponse.\n \n \n Best regards,\n Hajia Mariam  Abacha.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4513829"}, {"subject": "Re: cordit", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4522570"}, {"subject": "?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????", "content": "????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????\n\n??????????????????:\n\n    ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? \n????????????????????????????????????,????,????,????????????????????????????????????????/????/????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????5????????????????????????????????\"??????\"?????? ??????????????????????????????????????????\n\n1??????????????????????????????????/??????????/????????????/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n2??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????10??????????????\n\n3?? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????quot;??????????????\"??????????????????????\"??????????????\"??????????????????????\"????????????\"??????????????????????????????????\"????????????\"????????????????????????????????.\n\n??????????????????\n\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Excel????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n??????????????????\n\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n????????????????????\n\n????????????Windows????,????????????????????????\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...... ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n??????????????\n\n??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n??????????\n(1)????????????????????????????????????????????\n(2)??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n(3)??????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n\n????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????.....\n??????????????????????????????http://wlhome.432.cn\n??????????????????????????????http://wlhome.432.cn\n????EMAIL??????????????tongke20002000@yahoo.com.cn\n\n????????????\n??????????020-87227312      87228312           QQ:36768830 \nEMAIL??tongke20002000@yahoo.com.cn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4528803"}, {"subject": "Dating Website Software for sale $99 - THE MAKING MONEY MACHINE FOR  JUST $9", "content": "I am selling a Dating Website software script for just $99\n\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED PLEASE E-MAIL ME AT plpmauto@yahoo.com or plpm@cantv.net\n\nThanks.\n\nThis is 1 time email.

I was the account officer to one Mr. Butch.R.Miguel who died along with his family on the 8th of November 1999 in an ADC Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared dead.  He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of $15.5million FiFteen million five hundred thousand USA Dollars. Since the management got the information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or his next of kin to come up and claim his money. Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his relation or friends has come up for the claim. The banking and financial law of Merith Intl.Bank plc stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period of four (4) it will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\n\n On this discovery, I and two other senior staffs now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin to Butch.R.Miguel for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will soon proceed for my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my retirement. The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by the fact that the customer Mr. Butch.R.Miguel was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that 30% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account,you will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,indicating your bank account number and location where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest,I will send to you the text of the application that you will send to the Merith Intl.Bank authority for an approval to submit your claims. Send your reply through my direct and private email address.(waziriadio@702mail.co.za)indicates your direct Fax and telephone number for effective communication that this transaction needs. Do not reply through the Merith Intl.Bank email address because it?s belonged to the senior staffs for public use. \n\nPlease note that you are not to appear in person, as every thing regarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every banking documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by my self.\n\nLooking forward to your urgent response.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nWaziri Adio.\nMERITH INTL.

I am Zulu Danjuma, the first and only surviving son of late Marc Masuku Danjuma one of the foremost and rich black farmers in Zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg-South Africa, to deposit the sum of US$15 million (Fifteen Million United States Dollars) in one of the private security companies, as family valuables, when he realized the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in Swaziland.\n\nThis land dispute started when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land reform, which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers (my father included). This resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers (mainly whites) and the unlawful possession of their properties by Mugabe?s war veterans, under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country. It is against this background that I fled the country with my family, to the Netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum.\n\nI have decided to seek foreign assistance, as the Netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind, hence this letter to you. All I need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities. My family?s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets.\n\nThere are two options, firstly, you can choose to accept 30% of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country. We shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone & fax numbers. \n\nI await your reply through thiscontact e-mail address, == magamazulu@excite.com while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction.\n\nI shall furnish you with more details on request.\n\nPLEASE KINDLY REPLY ME THROUGH MY E MAIL ADDRESS WITH YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS FOR SECURITY PURPOSE==\nREPLY TO = magamazulu@excite.com\n\nYours truly,\nZULU DANJUMA\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4824264"}, {"subject": "BUSINESS INTRODUCTION/INVESTMEN", "content": "From: GIDEON AWELE\n40 WOODALE ST. \nLAGOS \nNIGERIA\nE-MAIL:gideonawele1@katamail.com\nTEL:234-802-3377864\n \nl am a financial consultant based in eastlondon Nigeria.l have a client (a \nwidow)she has $30,000,000USD with a private equity investment \ntrust company for safekeeping.

I know this letter might come to you as a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter in respect of my intention to invest the sum of US$28M(Twenty Eight Million United State Dollars) with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got through the smuggling and sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege situation. When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately affected us their children.\nConsidering the relationship between South Africa and the DemocraticRepublic of Congo new government, my mother advised me to leave For South Africa for security reason, while the funds were deposited with a security Company in Madrid Spain. \nOn getting to South Africa where I have been living since then as apolitical refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa due to my status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to take risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on\nbecause My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left I and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at the Security Company in Madrid Spain so that is why I decided that investing this money abroad should be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help.\nIn view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the term shall be varied. 5% for expenses, which may arise during the\ntransaction, fax and phone bills inclusive.$28million US Dollars. when the money($28million) is moved into your discrete account, you will be allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area of business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country which are dividends yielding.\nWhatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my private phone or Email, and keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family. \nBest Regards,\nMathias Kobi Kabila\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-4975299"}, {"subject": "Please help my famil", "content": "Good day, \n\nI have to first of all apologise for using this way to contact \nyou especially because of the seriousness of this message \nand because we have not met, but I am desperately in \nneed of help.

Though I am very rich, \nI was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused\n on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I \nregret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just \nwanting to have or make all the money in the world. \nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I \nwould live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that\n God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and \nassets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few \nclose friends. \nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided \nto give alms to charity \norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on\nearth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations\nin the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. \nNow that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself\nanymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my \naccounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity \norganization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money\nto themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not \nto be contended with what I have left for them. \nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit \nof fourty million dollars $40,000,000,00 that I have with a \nfinance/Security Company abroad.

I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action. I am Mr. Mark Zuba, a native of South Africa currently residing in Amsterdam, Netherlands for a management course, at the Hoge University. \n Allow me to explain my reason and importance of my writing to you. Sir I am requesting your assistance in order to redeem an investment made with the Southern Mining Corporations Limited, in which I am a senior executive.  The said investment now valued at Ten Million United States of American Dollars (U.S.$10,000.000.00) was purchased by Eric Reilly and contracted out to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited in September 1979.  This redeemable investment interest has now matured and has been cleared for disbursement since March of 2001. \n   Since then, there has been an extensive global wide attempt to locate and notify any living relatives of Eric Reilly being that he himself died in December 1987.  We have confirmed through three independent search agencies that there are no living relatives in which whose favour the investment can be paid.  Being that two of my colleagues are also executives in the account department of the Mining Corporation, we have access to all Reilly's information, we can claim this money with you.  All we need to do is file this claim in your identity and effecting the necessary documentary changes, which lies in our respective departments and proclaim you as actual beneficiary of this investment. \n These funds can be paid into any designated account in which you provide in any given country.  My proposal to you is that for your assistance you will withhold 30% of the total sum while, ensuring that my partners and I receive the remaining 70%. \n I hope that you are able to understand the entire nature of my proposal. There is no risk involved in this transaction now or after the successful conclusion of it. As stated earlier, there are no living relatives to lay claims on these funds. Therefore this transaction is legal, however without your assistance this money will be returned over to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited as lost fund. \n Please for further question, feel free to contact me through this e-mail address: markzuba@mail2world.com let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you. \nBest regards, \nMark Zuba \n\n\n\n                                                                      \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5007998"}, {"subject": "Niedostarczony mail:  Warning about your e-mail account", "content": "Drogi uzytkowniku,\nwiadomosc z nastepujacymi atrybutami nie zostala dostarczona do odbiorcy\nponiewaz zawiera zawirusowany obiekt.\n\nNadawca = ietf-charsets@w3.org\nOdbiorca = nowinki@aktivist.pl\nTemat =  Warning about your e-mail account.\nMessage-ID =  <yqclygqdvkqqlrsesvw@aktivist.pl>\n\nRaport antywirusowy:\n--- Indigo report ---\n127.0.0.1 [21357] www.indigo.pl:21311 - archive MAIL\n127.0.0.1 [21357] >www.indigo.pl:21311/Document.pif infected with Win32.HLLM.Beagle.based\n\n--- Indigo report ---\n\n---\n   Antivirus service provided by Indigo\n\n\n\n\ntext/rfc822-headers attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5016805"}, {"subject": "Niedostarczony mail:  E-mail account disabling warning", "content": "Drogi uzytkowniku,\nwiadomosc z nastepujacymi atrybutami nie zostala dostarczona do odbiorcy\nponiewaz zawiera zawirusowany obiekt.\n\nNadawca = ietf-charsets@w3.org\nOdbiorca = nowinki@aktivist.pl\nTemat =  E-mail account disabling warning.\nMessage-ID =  <bmsagsucbpdqdodjtwa@aktivist.pl>\n\nRaport antywirusowy:\n--- Indigo report ---\n127.0.0.1 [21394] www.indigo.pl:21373 - archive MAIL\n127.0.0.1 [21394] >www.indigo.pl:21373/Readme.pif infected with Win32.HLLM.Beagle.based\n\n--- Indigo report ---\n\n---\n   Antivirus service provided by Indigo\n\n\n\n\ntext/rfc822-headers attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5024935"}, {"subject": "Virus Aler", "content": "The mail message (file: message_details.pif) you sent to <tcrambes@ch-perpignan.fr> contains a virus.

We have had various interests in mining (precious stones and coal), in tobacco, Real Estates, and in large scale farming through our Inyabamba Farms. In these we\nhave achieved tremendous success for several years.However in the past few years, our business has been drastically affected by government policies which have been against white minorities (of which my family is one) controlling the nations wealth. This has led to our being compelled to sell most of our interests, leaving only the Farms. But with the recent land Seizure Policy by the government, our farms and lands were forcefully taken from us by the majority blacks led by ex-war veterans. The physical attacks and trauma led to my husband?s ill health, which sadly led to his demise. With the continuous discrimination and insensitivity to our situation, it has become impossible for my\nchildren and I to continue in the only environment we have always known. I am now seeking to invest our saved resources abroad in a safer environment were I intend to subsequently relocate with my family.

My name is Mrs.SUSAN OKOBI. I am a widow and a mother\nof three all girls. I know you will see my letter to you as an embarrassment considering the fact that we do\nnot know ourselves. I plead with you to be patient with me I feel very pleased to contact you for some\nassistance and business relationship. I live in Nigeria with my children. My late husband was a loving, caring and hardworking businessman who died unfortunately In a ghastly auto crash. \n\nBefore the sudden death of my beloved husband, and father of my daughters, my late husband intended to establish a business in the united states of America with the sum of$30 million united states dollars, but unfortunately he died before this proposed venture. \n\nFollowing his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled to his property (Assets and money) since I am a woman and my offspring's all girls as I do not have a male child for my husband. Well, according to some barbaric traditional laws here in Nigeria (Africa) which doesn't permit a woman to inherit a man's\nproperty, as they are expected by tradition to take over the management of his business and other\nproperties including myself who automatically becomes a wife to one of his immediate brothers. \n\nUnfortunately to this wicked family members, the $30million united states dollars which my late husband intended to use in establishing a business in the United States was deposited in a bank account unknown to his family .I and the lawyer is the only one aware of this money, so I have discussed this matter with a staff of the bank that i want this money personally so that I will be able to take care of my children's educational needs since my husband's family members vehemently opposed the furtherance of their education. \n\nAccording to the staff of the bank, the best way to secure this money is to transfer this money to a bank account outside Nigeria For safe-keeping, later it will be used for business establishment subject to the Advise of whosoever finally assists us. At this juncture, I there fore ask for your sincere assistance in\nproviding us with your bank details and the enablement to facilitate the remittance of this fund into your\nnominated account. As soon as I get your positive response, I shall provide you with all the necessary\ndetail for this transfer. \nHowever, I have decided to to give you 20% of the total money as a reward for your sincere assistance and the remaining 65% of the money will be for my investment as I will want to keep aglow my late husbands dream of investing in real estate. \nTo be able to help me, kindly send through my email, your personal details including your contact information for easy communication. \n\nThanking you for your anticipated response.\n\nMrs.SUSAN OKOBI\n\nN.B: please all further correspodence should be directed to this email :mrssusanoeze@masrawy.com\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      \n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5194373"}, {"subject": "?????? ???????? ??????????!????5?????????? bfmaatxq vkkz", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5203565"}, {"subject": "???????????????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ????/1?? 1??,?????? ????!&#64", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5210310"}, {"subject": "Norton AntiVirus failed to scan an attachment in a message you se nt", "content": "Recipient of the attachment:  Webmaster Intranet EDS-AM\\Bandeja de entrada\nSubject of the message:  Mail Delivery (failure webmaster@aeromexico.com.mx)\nNo action was taken on the attachment.\n  Attachment message.scr was Logged Only for the following reasons:\n        Scan Engine Failure (0x80004005)\n\n\n\n\napplication/ms-tnef attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5217774"}, {"subject": "???????????????????????????????????", "content": "text/html attachment: stored\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5226073"}, {"subject": "Virus Alert &ndash; ScanMail for Lotus Notes&ndash;&ndash;&gt;Re: Here is the documen", "content": "Un virus a ?t? d?tect? lors du contr?le temps r?el de messagerie.

One day, she was \nreturning home from the market carrying a big heavy basket on her \nhead,when a rich man riding his car passed by. Kindly,he offered to \ndrive the lady to her home. She thanked him and got into the car with \nher basket.\n\nOn the way, the man glanced at the lady in the mirror, still holding \nher basket over her head. Astonished, he asked her to lay the basket \ndown in the car and rest.\n\nThe old lady naively replied, \"Oh my son, your car is carrying me; \nthis is enough, I should not burden it carrying my basket too!\"\n\nWhat an innocently funny response!\nWe sometimes do the same with God. Everyday, God carries us during \nthe day. Still, we insist on carrying our heavy baskets of worries \nand fear of the future, for family, kids,spouse, money, job, etc...\nWe are carried by Almighty  Hands, watched over by Sleepless Eyes and \nGod plans our future. Let us then relax and lay down everything in \nGod's Hands.  The old lady, if she agreed to lay down the basket, \nwould have to carry it again when back home. But the beautiful thing \nabout God is that once we cast our heavy basket in His Hands, we do \nnot need to think about it anymore.\n\n\"Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires \nof your heart.\" (Psalm 37:4)\n\nHave a wonderful blessed week - free of \"baskets.\"\n\n-- \nPlease Include The Following Text When You Forward This Email\nSUBSCRIBE  to the Inspiration List\nSend a email message to:\nInspiration-on@lists.inspirationlist.com\nor\n<mailto:inspiration-on@lists.inspirationlist.com>\n<>< + <>< + <>< + <>< + <>< + <>< + <>< + <>< +<>< + <>< + <>< + <><\n\nFor help with the Inspiration List:\n<http://www.inspirationlist.com/help.html>\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-5648877"}, {"subject": "13 fwd", "content": "Today is a new day for your residence.

Before I proceed please accept my apology for the embarrassment this mail might cause you for coming from a total  stranger who you do not know. Actually I got your contact from the Internet; please do not feel bad about  it because I am compelled to reach you due  to urgent need to safeguard the money in question. Once again, forgive me and come to my aid. Please read the following carefully.\nSometime in early 1997, my boss late Gen. Sanni Abacha entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5M in  cash (Twenty million, five hundred thousand US dollars)due to the trust and confidence he had in me. This money was meant for campaign in his self-succession id but unfortunately he suddenly died before actualization of his aspiration. This amount of \n$20.5M in CASH was deposited with a security company which I will disclose in subsequent mail in a giant trunk box as diplomatic consignments In agreement with Mr.Mohammed Abacha who is the son of late General Abacha and the heir to the money. I write to solicit your assistance  for the money to be transferred to your  custody. Note that Mr.Mohammed Abacha is currently in detention by the present Nigeria Government for reasons linked to activities of his father when he was in power. Now based on the business trust I have on you, I would want you to come forward and receive this consignment containing the  money in cash on our behalf from the security company for subsequent disbursement between you and us. Understand that we are soliciting your assistance because the present Nigerian Government is  seizing/freezing any Bank Account or valuables belonging to the late Head of state's family and relatives. In fact we do not have enough money now to sustain our family so, I will appreciate if you can consider our plight and assist us. For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you  with 20% of the total amount ($20.5) while the remaining 80% is for us. We hope to invest part of our share in your country on viable area of investment as you may advise us.\nIf you are interested you will need to visit the Security Company for clearance of the consignment.  I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk free. Please I implore you to keep this transaction  absolutely secret against negative exposure. I would want you to contact me immediately so that we  can proceed with the business. You should please  on reply enclose your private telephone, fax number so that we can have more confidential correspondence.\n\n\nBest regards,\nMrs.Amina Mohammed.\n\n\n\n", "id": "lists-005-6028201"}, {"subject": "Fwd: Unicode 4.0.1 Release", "content": "Begin forwarded message:\n\n> From: Rick McGowan <rick@unicode.org>\n>\n> Unicode 4.0.1 has been released!

This \nprofitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, \n\"green\" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid \nWaste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, \nindustrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, \nand the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale \nof electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous \nbasis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity \nwhich is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.\n\nThe Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide \nneed for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a \ncorresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the \ndisposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for \na revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the \nglobal waste problem while a major push for generating \nelectricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot \ntopic due to shortages and massive power failures.\n\nFinancing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:\n\nThe magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the \nfact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent \nto $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process \nSystems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding \ncould easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now \nfactor in that average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. \nWe cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for \nwith a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million \nshares outstanding!\n\nLETH Stock Guidance:\nCurrent Price: 1.55\nNear-Term Target: 4.80\nProjected High for '04: 12.50\n\nLETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:\n\nLETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, \n$21) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, \nmechanical, and electrical management consulting services \nprimarily for the US Government with annual sales of $800 Million. \nTetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, \ninstallation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the \nBiosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the \nprocess of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality \npermitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. \nThis is a monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates \nfor major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel\neffect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.\n\nPolitical Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:\n\nLETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and \ninternational investors by embracing a major foothold on the \nglobal waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate \nelectricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished \nby successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the \nglobe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. \nAlbert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime \nMinister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been \ninstrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide \ndominance in an industry with such high global demand that it \nis impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.\n\nUncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:\n\nWe are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the \nfrequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, \nthe impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and \nthe Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly \ntimed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts \nthat will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales \nrecords. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate the \ncontinuation of strong positive developments that will ignite \nLETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term trading \nprofits followed by robust long-term capital gains.\n\nTop Pick of the Month cautions that small and micro-cap stocks are \nhigh-risk investments and that some or all investment dollars can \nbe lost.

What am I missing?\n\nIn Geoff's scenario, the checkout request tells the server to implement\nlogic creating a new branch, or to use the original branch at checkin time,\ndepending on whether other checkins have occurred since checkout. In\nGeoffrey's scenario, the _server_ decides.\n\nIn the \"forcebranch\" scenario, the client must remember _both_ the main\nbranch name, and the name of the \"reserved\" branch, and whether the user's\nintention is to check into the one or the other. They could be forcing a\nbranch because they _intend to create a new branch_ or because they want to\nreserve a new branch in case they _don't_ check back into the mainline. The\nserver doesn't know this, so the client must remember it, or prompt the\nuser at every checkin.\n\nIn either case, the server might answer \"merge is required to check into\nthe parent branch,\" so I don't see that forcebranch simplifies the protocol.\n\nI can even imagine servers that would not create a new branch on an\nunreserved checkin, but would simply add merge arcs. For example, if\nrevision 1 is checked out (unreserved); revision 2 gets created by a third\nparty; then when revision 3 is checked in, no branching may be required:\nrevision 3 can be recorded as a merge of revision 1 and revision 2. Of\ncourse, the server must fail on the initial request to \"simply\" check in\nrevision 3.\n\nThe question is whether clients should be required to implement \"unreserved\ncheckout\" semantics if they are desired (and I think we agree that they are\nneeded), or whether that is something that _servers_ should implement, and\nwhere clients can offer the option at their discretion.\n\nI incline to thinking that the policy decisions should _all_ be made by\nservers, and that clients should be offered all of the request options\nrequired to work under reasonable server policies. It seems to me that\npolicy implementation in clients may make some policies unavailable to some\nusers even when using servers that support those policies. It also makes\nclients more complex rather than simpler.\n\nThis does not _outlaw_ smarter, more policy sensitive clients. If one\n_wants_ to enforce (or assumes) particular policies it need _not_ request\nserver options not wanted. It could even refuse to communicate with servers\nthat don't offer them guarantees (such as locking) that they wish enforced.\n\nTo drop down to a low level  (protocol) for a minute, I think we want two\nverbs:\n\ncheckout and checkin.\n\nEach can request \"locking\" of the branch (reservation of a branch for checkin)\noptional specification of which branch (change set) is desired\noptional request that forking be prohibited/allowed.\n\nserver policies will determine what combinations of these are accepted and\nwhen. We probably do need to say _if_ any guarantees should be made by a\nserver on accepting such an option: forking seems like the only one that\nmust generate a hard guarantee. Change-oriented systems can, for instance,\nalways answer yes to any lock request, if they want to, because they have\nno system requirements for locking.\n\nI haven't said what a nil (unspecified) branch ID might mean on either of\nthese requests. It could invoke some kind of default processing, or it\ncould signify that the server should create a branch. It may be that we\nneed to distinguish  a user-specified branch, a request for a default\nbranch, or a request for the server to create a branch.\n\nAlso open is whether a special merge operation is required. An option flag\nto checkin that changes its parameters seems clumsy to me, but instead of\nan option, any checkin could specify a list of predecessor nodes (so that\nany checkin could be a merge), then it seems more coherent than some kind\nof option-setting interface.\n\nI'm not an expert on branching models, but it seems to me that we should be\nleaving policy to servers (which is where it currently seems to reside\nanyway), and concentrate on allowing clients the ability to _request_ from\na server any options that make sense under any reasonable policy, whenever\nit performs an operation. The server is always free to deny any such\nrequest, as well as to suggest another kind of request: e.g. we probably\nwill need errors like \"merge required for sucessful checkin\".\n\n   -- David\n\n\n\nDavid Durand              dgd@cs.bu.edu  \\  david@dynamicDiagrams.com\nBoston University Computer Science        \\  Sr. Analyst\nhttp://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/   \\  Dynamic Diagrams\n--------------------------------------------\\  http://www.dynamicDiagrams.com/\nMAPA: mapping for the WWW                    \\\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9897521"}, {"subject": "Re[3]: More Check-out/in Branch Semantics", "content": "     David said:\n     I incline to thinking that the policy decisions should _all_ be made\n     by servers, and that clients should be offered all of the request\n     options required to work under reasonable server policies.

However, it was not my intention that the client be made\nto remember either of the branches.  The assumption I was making was that\nthe client would decide at checkin if the branch was still desired, or if a\nmerge was desired.  The branches involved can be derived from the state of\nthe Vgraph and who owns which revisions.\n\nNow if you want the CHECKOUT options to completely drive the behavior (at\nleast the default behavior) of CHECKIN, then I can see you need more than\njust ForceBranch.\n\nSo now I see Geoff's original point.  If you use -reserve and can also\ndesignate a branch name indicating a branch other than the original branch,\nthis serves the same purpose as -ForceBranch.\n\nIf we can also allow a new branch name, or some how indicate that a new\nbranch is to be created (without even specifying a branch name), I think\nthat solves all my original issues.\n\n     --Sarge\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9905506"}, {"subject": "test", "content": "test\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9909948"}, {"subject": "defining a versioned resource to be a \"collection\"", "content": "Rather than send out all my comments on the latest protocol draft\nin one \"bulk mailing\", I decided to break in up into several smaller\nthreads for easier automated thread management (if anyone feels this\nis a mistake, please let me know).\n\nHaving two ways of specifying a revision, i.e. either as a\nrevision-URI or as a <versioned-resource-URI, revision-id> pair, adds\nsome amount of complexity to the protocol.

First, I\ndon't understand how you would handle the versioning of a collection\nresource itself.  Does it become a collection of collections?\n\nAs for complexity, I'd argue it is a wash.  You trade the complexity of the\npair of information for the complexity of inserting extra collections into\nthe namespace.\n\nWe would also have to add the notion of a \"default\" member to a collection.\nThat is, if I do a GET on the versioned resource, which is just a\ncollection, which resource within the collection do I return (this is the\nPIN method, but the semantics are a little broader now -- not that this is\nbad).\n\nI also think the collections approach assumes a basic linear history.  Once\nyou get into resource-level branching, do we represent the branch as another\ncollection?  If so, the collections of collections are going to get very\ncomplex, very fast.\n\nWhen building Web sites, the inter-page links are very important.  I believe\npeople want to be able to version their sites without requiring a lot of\nlink updating to occur.  That is, I should be able to create different\nbranches and have my links still work by passing in headers to qualify the\nURI.  By introducing namespace changes to refer to the branches and versions\n(or even configurations), you force the links to have to change.\n\nChris\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9930389"}, {"subject": "versioned collections: a proposal", "content": "* Versioned Collection Challenges\n\nAs has been pointed out in several messages, versioned collections\npresent a couple of challenging use cases.\n\nFirst, when a versioned resource is \"deleted\" from a versioned\nresource collection, the resource itself cannot actually be deleted,\nsince it still must be visible in the earlier revisions of that\nversioned resource collection.\n\nSecond, when a new revision is to be selected from a versioned\nresource that is the leaf of a nested set of versioned collections,\nthe appropriate versions of the containing collections must exist and\nbe selected in order for that new leaf revision to be visible.\n\nIn order to relieve simple versioning systems from having to\naddress these problems, I propose that we only support versioned\ncollections as part of DAV:configurations and not part of\nDAV:basicversioning.  I also propose that the following constructs\nreplace the corresponding constructs of section 5 (\"Configurations\")\nof draft-webdav-versioning-00.\n\n\n* Repositories, Configurations, and Workspaces\n\nTo support versioned collections, I propose that the members of a\nrevision of a versioned collection should be *references* to other\n*versioned resources* (not the versioned resource itself, nor a\nreferences to particular revisions).  I further propose that the\nversioned resources referenced by collection revisions be members of a\nspecial non-versioned collection called a \"repository\".\n\nHaving collection revision members be references solves the first\nversioned collection problem (what is deleted is a reference to the\nversioned resource, not the versioned resource itself).  To solve the\nsecond problem, I propose that we introduce a special XML element\ncalled a \"configuration\" to provide an extensible mechanism for\ndefining version selection, and that we introduce the concept of a\n\"workspace\" resource as a mechanism for combining a versioned\ncollection with a configuration, to \"instantiate\" the collection\nrevisions (i.e. to produce collections whose members are the\nrevisions selected by the configuration from the versioned\nresources that are the members of the collection revision).\n\nIn addition, just as repositories provide the collections that\ncontain the versioned resources, workspaces will provide the collections\nthat contain the working resources.\n\n\n* Definitions\n\n\"Repository\" - a non-versioned collection resource that contains\nversioned resources.\n\n\"Configuration\" - an XML element that defines a version selection\nrule, i.e. a configuration can be used to select a specific revision\nof a given versioned resource.\n\n\"Workspace\" - a non-versioned resource that contains \"instances\" (or\nis an \"instance\") of a revision of a versioned resource.  An instance\nof a non-collection revision is either a reference to the revision, or\nis a working resource created by checking out the revision.  An\ninstance of a collection revision is a non-versioned collection, each\nof whose members is an instance of a revision of a member of the\ncollection revision being instantiated.\n\n(Note: a workspace can be seen as a generalization of the \"VPortal\"\nconcept from Jim Whitehead's original Versioning protocol proposal.\n\n\n* Predefined Configuration Elements\n\nAlthough a configuration is intended to be an extensible concept,\na few common configuration elements will be pre-defined.\n- LABEL-CONFIG element: the XML element specifies the name of a label.\n  This will select the revision of a versioned resource with that label.\n- BRANCH-CONFIG element: the XML element specifies the name of a branch.\n  This will select the latest revision of that versioned resource on that\n  branch.\n- DATED-BRANCH-CONFIG element: the XML element specifies both\n  the name of a branch and a date.  This will select the latest revision\n  of that versioned resource on that branch on or before the specified date.\n\n\n* Version Selection Conflicts\n\nIf multiple configuration elements are specified in a configuration,\na \"conflict\" can result if the configuration elements select incompatible\nrevisions (e.g. two revisions on different branches of the versioned\nresource).\n\n\n* Workspace Properties\n\nThe WORKSPACE-ROOT property of a workspace specifies the versioned\nresource of which the workspace is an instance.  If the WORKSPACE-ROOT\nis a collection, then a revision of each of the members of that\ncollection is instantiated in that workspace as well.\n\nThe WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION property of a workspace specifies the\nrules for selecting which revisions are instantiated in the workspace.\n\nThe WORKSPACE-CONFLICTS property contains an XML element describing\nall conflicts produced when the WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION is\ninstantiated on the WORKSPACE-ROOT.\n\n\n* Working Resources Properties\n\nWhen a working resource is created following a checkout, the working\nresource will be \"from a specific revision\", \"on a specific branch\",\nand \"in a specific workspace\".  This information is stored in the\nWR-REVISION, WR-BRANCH, and WR-WORKSPACE properties of the working\nresource.\n\n\n* An Example\n\nFor this example, I will assume that the repository is implemented as\njust a directory containing a set of RCS files, and a workspace is\nimplemented as a directory tree containing copies of the appropriate\nrevisions.  For a more sophisticated configuration management system,\none or more databases would normally be used to supplement (or\nreplace) the set of files containing the revisions of a versioned\nresource, and various file caches used to share revisions between\nmultiple workspaces.\n\nI will further assume that a versioned collection will be represented\nas a special RCS file with a \".dir,v\" extension, where each revision\nof a versioned collection consists of a list of member id's with the\nURI of the appropriate versioned resource.\n\nThe example repository would have then have a URI such as:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/\n\nand would have members such as:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/inc.dir,v\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/msg.h,v\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/print.c,v\n\nUsing my earlier proposal that versioned resources be collections,\nthe revisions of \"hello.c,v\" would have the URI's such as:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.0\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.1\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.1.1.0\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r2.1\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r2.1.1.0\n\nThe contents of:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v/r2.1\n\nwould then be lines of text such as:\n\n  hello.c <http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v>\n  print.c <http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/print.c,v>\n  inc     <http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/inc.dir,v>\n\nThen there could be a few workspaces with URI's:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/integ/\n  http://www.intersolv.com/home/sarge/ws/dev/\n\nwhere the properties of:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/\n\ncould be:\n\n  <D:prop>\n    <D:workspace-root>\n      http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v </D:workspace-root>\n    <D:workspace-configuration>\n      <D:label-config> stable </D:label-config>\n      </D:workspace-configuration> </D:prop>\n\nAssume that \"print.c\" is checked-out in \"gclemm/ws/dev\".\nAlso assume that the following revisions:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v/r2.1\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/inc.dir,v/r1.0\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.5\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/print.c,v/r1.2\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/msg.h,v/r1.3\n\neach have the property:\n\n  <D:prop>\n    <D:label> stable </D:label>\n    </D:prop>\n\nThen a recursive listing of the workspace \"gclemm/ws/dev\" would be:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/src/\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/src/hello.c\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/src/print.c\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/inc/\n  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/inc/msg.h\n\nwhere \"hello.c\" is a reference to:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.5\n\nwhere \"msg.h\" is a reference to:\n\n  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/msg.h,v/r1.3\n\nand where print.c is a working resource.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9936850"}, {"subject": "Re: defining a versioned resource to be a \"collection\"", "content": "Chris raises several good questions.  In order to answer them, I will\nin several cases refer to a proposal for handling versioned collections\nthat I posted earlier today to this mailing list (it's subject was\n\"versioned collections: a proposal\".\n\n   From: Chris Kaler <ckaler@microsoft.com>\n\n      From: Geoffrey M. Clemm [gclemm@tantalum.atria.com]\n      ...\n      Since a collection is\n      a canonical way of specifying a resource as some base resource\n      extended by some unique (wrt that base resource) identifier, why don't\n      we just define a versioned-resource to be a collection, and each\n      revision to be a member of that collection identified by what we have\n      been calling the revision-id?\n      ...\n\n   ... I think your approach has some problems.  First, I\n   don't understand how you would handle the versioning of a collection\n   resource itself.  Does it become a collection of collections?\n\nYes.  (See the \"versioned collections\" article for details).\n\n   As for complexity, I'd argue it is a wash.  You trade the complexity of the\n   pair of information for the complexity of inserting extra collections into\n   the namespace.\n\nInserting extra collections into the namespace does not increase the\ncomplexity of the protocol, while requiring a pair of identifiers to\nidentify a revision resource does (e.g. the new header needed to specify\nthe revision id, and extending the method semantics to use or ignore\nthe new header).  This is certainly something we could cope with if we\nhad to, but I'd need to see some real benefit before paying the price.\n\n   We would also have to add the notion of a \"default\" member to a collection.\n   That is, if I do a GET on the versioned resource, which is just a\n   collection, which resource within the collection do I return (this is the\n   PIN method, but the semantics are a little broader now -- not that this is\n   bad).\n\nI don't see why we would have to define in general the notion of a\n\"default\" member of a collection.  We define the notion for versioned\nresources, and that isn't affected by whether the versioned resource happens\nto be a collection (of revisions).\n\n   I also think the collections approach assumes a basic linear history.\n\nWhy?  A standard collection is just a set with identifiers for the members.\nThis implies nothing about the linear nature of the history (this is determined\nfrom the predecessor/successor properties of the revisions).\n\n   Once\n   you get into resource-level branching, do we represent the branch as another\n   collection?\n\nOne could, but I wouldn't recommend doing so.  I'd just make the branch\nbe a property of the revision.  In particular, this branch-as-property\napproach allows you to support the \"change-set\" approach with no change\nto the protocol.\n\n   If so, the collections of collections are going to get very\n   complex, very fast.\n\nAnother reason not to do so.\n\n   When building Web sites, the inter-page links are very important.  I believe\n   people want to be able to version their sites without requiring a lot of\n   link updating to occur.   That is, I should be able to create different\n   branches and have my links still work by passing in headers to qualify the\n   URI.  By introducing namespace changes to refer to the branches and versions\n   (or even configurations), you force the links to have to change.\n\nI assume that you are referring to the problems of handling absolute\ninter-page links in the presence of namespace versioning?  (Relative\ninter-page links require no additional headers).\n\nI agree that this is an important problem, but I do not believe it can\nbe effectively solved by passing around a \"revision-id\".  To solve\nthis problem, you need to pass around a \"version-selection\" header\nthat indicates what revision should be selected from each of the\nversioned collections back to the root of the URI space.  In addition,\nyou need to indicate when you want a revision, and when you want a\nworking resource.\n\nIn my proposal for handling versioned collections, this problem would\nbe addressed by passing around a \"workspace\" header, and then\nupgrading all methods to treat absolute URI's in a document as\nrelative URI's wrt the specified workspace URI.\n\nCheers,\nGeoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9950221"}, {"subject": "Most recent vs. specific version (was  versioned collections: a p \troposal)", "content": "comments inline...\n\nFrom: Geoffrey M.

I was supposed to start an email thread about it, but got hung up.\n\nMy idea was that if we make them the same method, you remove much of the\nconfusion.  A checkout is, in many ways, a lock.  You \"checkout\" either\nshared or exclusive.  That is the same as a lock.  The only difference is\nthat you have a working resource.\n\n                - What if you want to leave the working resource available\nfor anyone\n                to modify?

In many systems,\nexplicit locking is used.  PUTs with require the lock-id to be specified.\nBy tieing the two together, clients don't need to worry (or think) abou the\n\"working resource\".  They do their PUT to the versioned resource and specify\nthe checkout lock.  The server validates the lock and updates the working\nresource.  I actually think this is much easier for the client than having\nto track the versioned resource, the working resource, and the lock-id.\nLess information, consistent protocol.\n\n                - When you \"checkout\" a versioned resource, you create a new\n(working)\n                resource.  A \"lock\" is not something you expect to create a\nnew resource.\n\nBut many (most) checkouts result in the versioned resource being locked in\nsome way.  So this approach lessens the round-trips and the information the\nclient must track and keeps the protocol almost exactly the same as\nnon-versioning.\n\nChris\n\n\n                -----Original Message-----\n                From:   Geoffrey M.

Clemm [mailto:gclemm@tantalum.atria.com]\n                Sent:   Monday, November 09, 1998 4:14 AM\n                To:     ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org\n                Subject:        versioned collections: a proposal\n\n                * Versioned Collection Challenges\n\n                As has been pointed out in several messages, versioned\ncollections\n                present a couple of challenging use cases.\n\n                First, when a versioned resource is \"deleted\" from a\nversioned\n                resource collection, the resource itself cannot actually be\ndeleted,\n                since it still must be visible in the earlier revisions of\nthat\n                versioned resource collection.\n\n                Second, when a new revision is to be selected from a\nversioned\n                resource that is the leaf of a nested set of versioned\ncollections,\n                the appropriate versions of the containing collections must\nexist and\n                be selected in order for that new leaf revision to be\nvisible.\n\n                In order to relieve simple versioning systems from having to\n                address these problems, I propose that we only support\nversioned\n                collections as part of DAV:configurations and not part of\n                DAV:basicversioning.  I also propose that the following\nconstructs\n                replace the corresponding constructs of section 5\n(\"Configurations\")\n                of draft-webdav-versioning-00.\n\n\n                * Repositories, Configurations, and Workspaces\n\n                To support versioned collections, I propose that the members\nof a\n                revision of a versioned collection should be *references* to\nother\n                *versioned resources* (not the versioned resource itself,\nnor a\n                references to particular revisions).  I further propose that\nthe\n                versioned resources referenced by collection revisions be\nmembers of a\n                special non-versioned collection called a \"repository\".\n\n                Having collection revision members be references solves the\nfirst\n                versioned collection problem (what is deleted is a reference\nto the\n                versioned resource, not the versioned resource itself).  To\nsolve the\n                second problem, I propose that we introduce a special XML\nelement\n                called a \"configuration\" to provide an extensible mechanism\nfor\n                defining version selection, and that we introduce the\nconcept of a\n                \"workspace\" resource as a mechanism for combining a\nversioned\n                collection with a configuration, to \"instantiate\" the\ncollection\n                revisions (i.e. to produce collections whose members are the\n                revisions selected by the configuration from the versioned\n                resources that are the members of the collection revision).\n\n                In addition, just as repositories provide the collections\nthat\n                contain the versioned resources, workspaces will provide the\ncollections\n                that contain the working resources.\n\n\n                * Definitions\n\n                \"Repository\" - a non-versioned collection resource that\ncontains\n                versioned resources.\n\n                \"Configuration\" - an XML element that defines a version\nselection\n                rule, i.e. a configuration can be used to select a specific\nrevision\n                of a given versioned resource.\n\n                \"Workspace\" - a non-versioned resource that contains\n\"instances\" (or\n                is an \"instance\") of a revision of a versioned resource.  An\ninstance\n                of a non-collection revision is either a reference to the\nrevision, or\n                is a working resource created by checking out the revision.\nAn\n                instance of a collection revision is a non-versioned\ncollection, each\n                of whose members is an instance of a revision of a member of\nthe\n                collection revision being instantiated.\n\n                (Note: a workspace can be seen as a generalization of the\n\"VPortal\"\n                concept from Jim Whitehead's original Versioning protocol\nproposal.\n\n\n                * Predefined Configuration Elements\n\n                Although a configuration is intended to be an extensible\nconcept,\n                a few common configuration elements will be pre-defined.\n                - LABEL-CONFIG element: the XML element specifies the name\nof a label.\n                  This will select the revision of a versioned resource with\nthat label.\n                - BRANCH-CONFIG element: the XML element specifies the name\nof a branch.\n                  This will select the latest revision of that versioned\nresource on that\n                  branch.\n                - DATED-BRANCH-CONFIG element: the XML element specifies\nboth\n                  the name of a branch and a date.  This will select the\nlatest revision\n                  of that versioned resource on that branch on or before the\nspecified date.\n\n\n                * Version Selection Conflicts\n\n                If multiple configuration elements are specified in a\nconfiguration,\n                a \"conflict\" can result if the configuration elements select\nincompatible\n                revisions (e.g. two revisions on different branches of the\nversioned\n                resource).\n\n\n                * Workspace Properties\n\n                The WORKSPACE-ROOT property of a workspace specifies the\nversioned\n                resource of which the workspace is an instance.  If the\nWORKSPACE-ROOT\n                is a collection, then a revision of each of the members of\nthat\n                collection is instantiated in that workspace as well.\n\n                The WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION property of a workspace\nspecifies the\n                rules for selecting which revisions are instantiated in the\nworkspace.\n\n                The WORKSPACE-CONFLICTS property contains an XML element\ndescribing\n                all conflicts produced when the WORKSPACE-CONFIGURATION is\n                instantiated on the WORKSPACE-ROOT.\n\n\n                * Working Resources Properties\n\n                When a working resource is created following a checkout, the\nworking\n                resource will be \"from a specific revision\", \"on a specific\nbranch\",\n                and \"in a specific workspace\".  This information is stored\nin the\n                WR-REVISION, WR-BRANCH, and WR-WORKSPACE properties of the\nworking\n                resource.\n\n\n                * An Example\n\n                For this example, I will assume that the repository is\nimplemented as\n                just a directory containing a set of RCS files, and a\nworkspace is\n                implemented as a directory tree containing copies of the\nappropriate\n                revisions.  For a more sophisticated configuration\nmanagement system,\n                one or more databases would normally be used to supplement\n(or\n                replace) the set of files containing the revisions of a\nversioned\n                resource, and various file caches used to share revisions\nbetween\n                multiple workspaces.\n\n                I will further assume that a versioned collection will be\nrepresented\n                as a special RCS file with a \".dir,v\" extension, where each\nrevision\n                of a versioned collection consists of a list of member id's\nwith the\n                URI of the appropriate versioned resource.\n\n                The example repository would have then have a URI such as:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/\n\n                and would have members such as:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/inc.dir,v\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/msg.h,v\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/print.c,v\n\n                Using my earlier proposal that versioned resources be\ncollections,\n                the revisions of \"hello.c,v\" would have the URI's such as:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.0\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.1\n        \nhttp://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.1.1.0\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r2.1\n        \nhttp://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r2.1.1.0\n\n                The contents of:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v/r2.1\n\n                would then be lines of text such as:\n\n                  hello.c\n<http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v>\n                  print.c\n<http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/print.c,v>\n                  inc\n<http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/inc.dir,v>\n\n                Then there could be a few workspaces with URI's:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/integ/\n                  http://www.intersolv.com/home/sarge/ws/dev/\n\n                where the properties of:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/\n\n                could be:\n\n                  <D:prop>\n                    <D:workspace-root>\n                      http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v\n</D:workspace-root>\n                    <D:workspace-configuration>\n                      <D:label-config> stable </D:label-config>\n                      </D:workspace-configuration> </D:prop>\n\n                Assume that \"print.c\" is checked-out in \"gclemm/ws/dev\".\n                Also assume that the following revisions:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/src.dir,v/r2.1\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/inc.dir,v/r1.0\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.5\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/print.c,v/r1.2\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/msg.h,v/r1.3\n\n                each have the property:\n\n                  <D:prop>\n                    <D:label> stable </D:label>\n                    </D:prop>\n\n                Then a recursive listing of the workspace \"gclemm/ws/dev\"\nwould be:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/src/\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/src/hello.c\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/src/print.c\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/inc/\n                  http://www.rational.com/home/gclemm/ws/dev/inc/msg.h\n\n                where \"hello.c\" is a reference to:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/hello.c,v/r1.5\n\n                where \"msg.h\" is a reference to:\n\n                  http://www.rational.com/web-dav/repo/test/msg.h,v/r1.3\n\n                and where print.c is a working resource.\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9984854"}, {"subject": "Re: defining a versioned resource to be a \"collection\"", "content": "I don't this approach works for one of my canonical cases.  I have a Web\nsite that I update using DAV.  We now have a DAV server that supports\nversioning.  Some of my clients are using non-versioning DAV clients, some\nare using versioning-aware DAV clients.  Both clients should be able to see\nand operate on the structure of the Web.\n\nI think getting this right adds more complexity to the clients which is\nwhere I think we should be simplifying.  I guess I don't understand why\npassing a version token is bad.  You will likely be holding a lock token\nanyway, so why is this so much of a burden?\n\nPossibly a disconnect here is they way I think of versioned resources.\nPersonally, I like the idea that the URI namespace refers to versioned\nresources and that you specify the revision-id header to refer to a specific\nrevision, otherwise the request is against the versioned resource (or the\ndefault revision).  Of course you can always obtain a URI for a specific\nrevision.  I think this approach makes clients much easier to build and\nmakes the protocol transition from non-versioning to versioning easier.  As\nwell, I prefer not to define server-side structure whenever possible as it\nties the hands of the server writer.\n\nChris\n\n                -----Original Message-----\n                From:   Geoffrey M.

In order to answer\nthem, I will\n                in several cases refer to a proposal for handling versioned\ncollections\n                that I posted earlier today to this mailing list (it's\nsubject was\n                \"versioned collections: a proposal\".\n\n                   From: Chris Kaler <ckaler@microsoft.com>\n\n                      From: Geoffrey M. Clemm [gclemm@tantalum.atria.com]\n                      ...\n                      Since a collection is\n                      a canonical way of specifying a resource as some base\nresource\n                      extended by some unique (wrt that base resource)\nidentifier, why don't\n                      we just define a versioned-resource to be a\ncollection, and each\n                      revision to be a member of that collection identified\nby what we have\n                      been calling the revision-id?\n                      ...\n\n                   ... I think your approach has some problems.  First, I\n                   don't understand how you would handle the versioning of a\ncollection\n                   resource itself.  Does it become a collection of\ncollections?\n\n                Yes.  (See the \"versioned collections\" article for details).\n\n                   As for complexity, I'd argue it is a wash.  You trade the\ncomplexity of the\n                   pair of information for the complexity of inserting extra\ncollections into\n                   the namespace.\n\n                Inserting extra collections into the namespace does not\nincrease the\n                complexity of the protocol, while requiring a pair of\nidentifiers to\n                identify a revision resource does (e.g. the new header\nneeded to specify\n                the revision id, and extending the method semantics to use\nor ignore\n                the new header).  This is certainly something we could cope\nwith if we\n                had to, but I'd need to see some real benefit before paying\nthe price.\n\n                   We would also have to add the notion of a \"default\"\nmember to a collection.\n                   That is, if I do a GET on the versioned resource, which\nis just a\n                   collection, which resource within the collection do I\nreturn (this is the\n                   PIN method, but the semantics are a little broader now --\nnot that this is\n                   bad).\n\n                I don't see why we would have to define in general the\nnotion of a\n                \"default\" member of a collection.  We define the notion for\nversioned\n                resources, and that isn't affected by whether the versioned\nresource happens\n                to be a collection (of revisions).\n\n                   I also think the collections approach assumes a basic\nlinear history.\n\n                Why?  A standard collection is just a set with identifiers\nfor the members.\n                This implies nothing about the linear nature of the history\n(this is determined\n                from the predecessor/successor properties of the revisions).\n\n                   Once\n                   you get into resource-level branching, do we represent\nthe branch as another\n                   collection?\n\n                One could, but I wouldn't recommend doing so.  I'd just make\nthe branch\n                be a property of the revision.  In particular, this\nbranch-as-property\n                approach allows you to support the \"change-set\" approach\nwith no change\n                to the protocol.\n\n                   If so, the collections of collections are going to get\nvery\n                   complex, very fast.\n\n                Another reason not to do so.\n\n                   When building Web sites, the inter-page links are very\nimportant.  I believe\n                   people want to be able to version their sites without\nrequiring a lot of\n                   link updating to occur.   That is, I should be able to\ncreate different\n                   branches and have my links still work by passing in\nheaders to qualify the\n                   URI.  By introducing namespace changes to refer to the\nbranches and versions\n                   (or even configurations), you force the links to have to\nchange.\n\n                I assume that you are referring to the problems of handling\nabsolute\n                inter-page links in the presence of namespace versioning?\n(Relative\n                inter-page links require no additional headers).\n\n                I agree that this is an important problem, but I do not\nbelieve it can\n                be effectively solved by passing around a \"revision-id\".  To\nsolve\n                this problem, you need to pass around a \"version-selection\"\nheader\n                that indicates what revision should be selected from each of\nthe\n                versioned collections back to the root of the URI space.  In\naddition,\n                you need to indicate when you want a revision, and when you\nwant a\n                working resource.\n\n                In my proposal for handling versioned collections, this\nproblem would\n                be addressed by passing around a \"workspace\" header, and\nthen\n                upgrading all methods to treat absolute URI's in a document\nas\n                relative URI's wrt the specified workspace URI.\n\n                Cheers,\n                Geoff\n     \n   \n\n", "id": "lists-005-9999894"}]
